          <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Food Chain in Motion 
          -- Kevin Sullivan's Tale</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In my 27 years as 
          a special agent with the National Marine Fisheries Service Office ofLaw 
          Enforcement, I've spent a lot of time on the ocean. But the single most 
          spectacular event I witnessed took place over twenty years ago in what 
          is now the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can't quite recall 
          the date. I believe it was 1978, perhaps 1979. I vividly remember the 
          day. It was a crisp autumn afternoon. With little wind the water was 
          like a mirror reflecting the west heading sun. Long, dark shadows followed 
          the Massachusetts Environmental Police patrol boat. I had joined a day-long 
          mission with two environmental police officers. We were on the lookout 
          for fishing vessels taking more than their legal share of giant bluefin 
          tuna. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stellwagen Bank, 
          which had not yet been designated as a National Marine Sanctuary, was, 
          and still is, a popular fishing spot for the giant fish. You have to 
          understand a bit about giant bluefin tuna to see why a fishermen would 
          break the law to catch them. True to their name, giant bluefin tuna 
          are enormous creatures, weighing as much as 1200 pounds. They can swim 
          at speeds of up to fifty miles per hour. These fish are called "highly 
          migratory species" due to their lengthy journeys from sea to shining 
          sea. Even back then, fisherman make a pretty penny selling these fish 
          in Japanese markets. They'd place the fish individually into large wooden 
          coffins, load them onto a 747, then ship them straight to Tokyo, where 
          dealers would pay up to 25 dollars a pound for them. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you do the math 
          you'll understand why catching just one giant bluefin tuna makes for 
          a profitable day at sea. For obvious reasons, some fisherman would like 
          to catch more than one. But by federal law, a fishing vessel can take 
          only one giant bluefin tuna per day. Tuna stocks had become unstable 
          in the mid-70's due to overexploitation around the world, especially 
          by distant water longliners. Scientists feared that populations would 
          collapse if fishing pressure kept up. The state officers and I wanted 
          to see to it that this didn't happen. We weren't just enforcing the 
          law out there; we were ensuring the survival of the majestic giant bluefin 
          tuna. At the same time, we had a genuine concern for maintaining "a 
          level playingfield" for the fishers who expend significant time and 
          money in the hunt for their valuable prize. Those who fail to achieve 
          their catch are said to have been "tuna wishing". </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, the two officers 
          and I were merrily making our way along the southwest corner of the 
          bank, not too far from Provincetown. As always, we tried to be aware 
          of breaking water to avoid collisions with marine mammals such as the 
          highly endangered right whale that frequents the Bank. One of us spied 
          white water splashing about a three iron from our boat. It was a school 
          of very scared sand eels leaping for their lives above the surface of 
          the water as hungry bluefish cunningly circled underneath awaiting their 
          appetizers. The jumping sand eels were a familiar sight, typical of 
          bluefish feeding frenzies. Pound for pound bluefish are probably the 
          fiercest fighters in the sea. But they were no match for what we then 
          saw: a school of bluefin tunas bursting though the water just behind 
          the bluefish. The table had turned. The predators became the prey. The 
          bluefish leapt from the water, frantically seeking escape from the powerful 
          jaws of the encroaching tunas. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back on the ship 
          we'd fallen silent as the spectacle of the food-chain in action unfolded 
          with the shocking appearance of the oceans&divide; ultimate force. The tell-tale 
          traits of bright white on black and the high triangle fins instantly 
          announced the presence of killer whales in hot pursuit of the marauding 
          bluefins. Killer whales aren't so common on the bank, but when they're 
          there, they like nothing more than a bluefin tuna dinner. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My best guess is 
          that the scene lasted about thirty seconds. I lost track of the time, 
          though. To me, time stood still, as if the whole event was a snapshot 
          of a natural process. We could see every level of the food chain at 
          work, except for the microscopic plant plankton and the somewhat larger 
          animal plankton that serves as the sand eels' food. Looking back, I 
          realize that if I'd had a good camera handy, I could have taken a picture 
          that would have enabled me to retire twenty years early!</font></p>
