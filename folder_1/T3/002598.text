News Release: 2004-001                         January 2, 2003NASA Spacecraft Makes Great Catch...Heads for TouchdownTeam Stardust, NASA's first dedicated sample return mission to acomet, passed a huge milestone today by successfully navigatingthrough the particle and gas-laden coma around comet Wild 2(pronounced "Vilt-2"). During the hazardous traverse, the spacecraftflew within 240 kilometers (149 miles) of the comet, catching samplesof comet particles and scoring detailed pictures of Wild 2'spockmarked surface. "Things couldn't have worked better in a fairy tale," said TomDuxbury, Stardust project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Pasadena, Calif."These images are better than we had hoped for in our wildest dreams,"said Ray Newburn of JPL, a co-investigator for Stardust.  "They willhelp us better understand the mechanisms that drive conditions oncomets.""These are the best pictures ever taken of a comet," said PrincipalInvestigator Dr. Don Brownlee of the University of Washington,Seattle.  "Although Stardust was designed to be a comet sample returnmission, the fantastic details shown in these images greatly exceedour expectations."The collected particles, stowed in a sample return capsule onboardStardust, will be returned to Earth for in-depth analysis. Thatdramatic event will occur on January 15, 2006, when the capsule makesa soft landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. Themicroscopic particle samples of comet and interstellar dust collectedby Stardust will be taken to the planetary material curatorialfacility at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for analysis. Stardust has traveled about 3.22 billion kilometers (2 billion miles)since its launch on February 7, 1999. As it closed the final gap withits cometary quarry, it endured a bombardment of particles surroundingthe nucleus of comet Wild 2.  To protect Stardust against the blast ofexpected cometary particles and rocks, the spacecraft rotated so itwas flying in the shadow of its "Whipple Shields."  The shields arenamed for American astronomer Dr. Fred L. Whipple, who, in the 1950s,came up with the idea of shielding spacecraft from high-speedcollisions with the bits and pieces ejected from comets. The systemincludes two bumpers at the front of the spacecraft -- which protectStardust's solar panels -- and another shield protecting the mainspacecraft body. Each shield is built around composite panels designedto disperse particles as they impact, augmented by blankets of aceramic cloth called Nextel that further dissipate and spread particledebris."Everything occurred pretty much to the minute," said Duxbury. "Andwith our cometary encounter complete, we invite everybody to tune inabout one million, 71 thousand minutes from now when Stardust returnsto Earth, bringing with it the first comet samples in the history ofspace exploration."Scientists believe in-depth terrestrial analysis of the samples willreveal much about comets and the earliest history of the solar system.Chemical and physical information locked within the cometary particlescould be the record of the formation of the planets and the materialsfrom which they were made.
