A very long, bright GRB triggered Konus-Wind at 2007-06-26
T0=14850.883 s UT (04:07:30.883). It was also observed by Suzaku-WAM, 
RHESSI and the MESSENGER neutron spectrometer, which also serves as a 
GRB detector.

The burst started at T-T0 ~-120 s and ended at T-T0 ~210 sec.
The Earth-crossing time of the onset was 14733 s UT (04:05:33).
The burst light curve shows several multipeaked pulses.

We have triangulated it to a 3 sigma error box whose coordinates are:

-----------------------------------------------
    RA(2000)                    Dec(2000)
-----------------------------------------------
Center:
  141.355 (09h 25m 25s)   -39.865 (-39d 51' 54")
Corners:
  139.529 (09h 18m 07s)   -39.872 (-39d 52' 20")
  142.903 (09h 31m 37s)   -40.020 (-40d 01' 11")
  143.210 (09h 32m 50s)   -39.805 (-39d 48' 17")
  139.838 (09h 19m 21s)   -39.673 (-39d 40' 24")
-------------------------------------------------

The error box area is 2047 square arcminutes.
The box may be improved.

Preliminary analysis of the Konus-Wind data yields
a burst fluence of ~4x10^-4 erg/cm2 (in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range),
the spectrum of the main part of the burst (from T0 to T0+190 s)
can be fitted (in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.5,
the high energy photon index beta = -2.3,
the peak energy Ep = 240 keV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available
at http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB070626_T14850/

Detailed spectral parameters will be reported later.

on behalf of the Suzaku WAM team, report:

The long burst, GRB 070626 (S. Golenetskii et al. GCN 6592) was
detected at 2007-06-26 04:07:30 UT (= T0) with the Suzaku Wide-band All-sky
Monitor (WAM), which covers an energy range of 50 keV - 5 MeV. The burst
continues from T= T0-120 sec to T0+210 sec, as already reported on GCN
6592. The object position reported by GCN 6592 corresponds to the
incident angle of (theta, phi) = (103 deg, 169 deg) to the HXD WAM,
where the energy response is well calibrated. 
The fluence in the 100 -- 1000 keV energy band was 2.25(+- 0.01) x
10^-4 erg/cm2, and the 1-sec peak flux was 19.5 +/- 0.2 photons/cm^2/sec 
in the same energy range.

According to preliminary analyses, the time averaged spectrum from T0
to T0+190 sec in the 120 keV to 2.0 MeV energy band can be reproduced by 
the Band function (Band et al. 1993, ApJ 413, p281) with the following 
parameters;
  alpha = -1.55 +/- 0.05, 
  beta  = -2.15 +/- 0.05, and
  Epeak =   600 +/- 50 keV.

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level, while systematic 
errors are not included. Since the on-board trigger system was disabled 
at the time of T0, no BST mode data with a time resolution of 15.625
msec is available, and the spectral analyses were performed by the 
continuous monitoring (TRN) data with the 1 sec resolution.

The light curve data with 1 sec resolution will be appeared at the web site 
 http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/suzaku/HXD-WAM/WAM-GRB/grb/untrig/grb_table.html

and T. Cline on behalf of the Konus-Wind team:

We report further analysis of the bright long GRB 070626
localized by IPN (Golenetskii  et al., GCN 6592).

As observed by Konus-Wind the burst
had a fluence of 3.91(-0.13, +0.16)x10^-4 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux measured from T0+73.216 s
1.94(-0.16, +0.20)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 4 MeV energy range).

The time-integrated spectrum of the burst
(from T0 to T0+187.905 s: this interval comprises ~93%
of the burst total counts) can be fitted
(in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.45 (-0.03, +0.04),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.28 (-0.12, +0.08),
the peak energy Ep = 226 (-17, +19) keV (chi2 = 79/68 dof).

The spectrum of the burst maximum
(accumulated from T0+72.192 s to T0+74.752 s)
is well fitted (in the 20 keV - 4 MeV range)
by GRBM (Band) model for which:
the low-energy photon index is alpha = -1.27 (-0.07, +0.08),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.51 (-0.88, +0.27),
the peak energy Ep = 355 (-62, +69) keV (chi2 = 77/69 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
