<i>Federal Reserve Board’s semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress</i><br>
Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate
<br>February 13, 2001</B>
<p>
I appreciate the opportunity this morning to present the
Federal Reserve's <a href="FullReport.htm">semiannual report on monetary policy</a>.
<p>
     The past decade has been extraordinary for the American
economy and monetary policy.  The synergies of key technologies
markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech
investments, led to a surge in business capital spending, and
significantly increased the underlying growth rate of productivity. 
The capitalization of those higher expected returns boosted equity
prices, contributing to a substantial pickup in household spending
on new homes, durable goods, and other types of consumption
generally, beyond even that implied by the enhanced rise in real
incomes.
<p>   
     When I last reported to you in July, economic growth was
just exhibiting initial signs of slowing from what had been an
exceptionally rapid and unsustainable rate of increase that began a
year earlier. 
<p>   
     The surge in spending had lifted the growth of the stocks of
many types of consumer durable goods and business capital
equipment to rates that could not be continued.  The elevated level
of light vehicle sales, for example, implied a rate of increase in the
number of vehicles on the road hardly sustainable for a mature
industry.  And even though demand for a number of high-tech
products was doubling or tripling annually, in many cases new
supply was coming on even faster.  Overall, capacity in high-tech
manufacturing industries rose nearly 50 percent last year, well in
excess of its rapid rate of increase over the previous three years. 
Hence, a temporary glut in these industries and falling prospective
rates of return were inevitable at some point.  Clearly, some
slowing in the pace of spending was necessary and expected if the
economy was to progress along a balanced and sustainable growth
path.
<p>
     But the adjustment has occurred much faster than most
businesses anticipated, with the process likely intensified by the rise
in the cost of energy that has drained business and household
purchasing power.  Purchases of durable goods and investment in
capital equipment declined in the fourth quarter.  Because the
extent of the slowdown was not anticipated by businesses, it
induced some backup in inventories, despite the more advanced
just-in-time technologies that have in recent years enabled firms to
adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in demand.   
Inventory-sales ratios rose only moderately; but relative to the
levels of these ratios implied by their downtrend over the past
decade, the emerging imbalances appeared considerably larger. 
Reflecting these growing imbalances, manufacturing purchasing
managers reported last month that inventories in the hands of their
customers had risen to excessively high levels.
<p>   
     As a result, a round of inventory rebalancing appears to be
in progress.  Accordingly, the slowdown in the economy that began
in the middle of 2000 intensified, perhaps even to the point of
growth stalling out around the turn of the year.  As the economy
slowed, equity prices fell, especially in the high-tech sector, where
previous high valuations and optimistic forecasts were being
reevaluated, resulting in significant losses for some investors.  In
addition, lenders turned more cautious.  This tightening of financial
conditions, itself, contributed to restraint on spending.
<p>
     Against this background, the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) undertook a series of aggressive monetary
policy steps.  At its December meeting, the FOMC shifted its
announced assessment of the balance of risks to express concern
about economic weakness, which encouraged declines in market
interest rates.  Then on January 3, and again on January 31, the
FOMC reduced its targeted federal funds rate 1/2 percentage point,
to its current level of 5-1/2 percent.  An essential precondition for
this type of response was that underlying cost and price pressures
remained subdued, so that our front-loaded actions were unlikely to
jeopardize the stable, low inflation environment necessary to foster
investment and advances in productivity.  
<p>   
     The exceptional weakness so evident in a number of
economic indicators toward the end of last year (perhaps in part the
consequence of adverse weather) apparently did not continue in
January.  But with signs of softness still patently in evidence at the
time of its January meeting, the FOMC retained its sense that the
risks are weighted toward conditions that may generate economic
weakness in the foreseeable future.
<p>   
     Crucial to the assessment of the outlook and the
understanding of recent policy actions is the role of technological
change and productivity in shaping near-term cyclical forces as well
as long-term sustainable growth.
<p>   
     The prospects for sustaining strong advances in productivity
in the years ahead remain favorable.  As one would expect,
productivity growth has slowed along with the economy.  But what
is notable is that, during the second half of 2000, output per hour
advanced at a pace sufficiently impressive to provide strong support
for the view that the rate of growth of structural productivity
remains well above its pace of a decade ago.
<p>     
	 Moreover, although recent short-term business profits have
softened considerably, most corporate managers appear not to have
altered to any appreciable extent their long-standing optimism
about the future returns from using new technology.  A recent
survey of purchasing managers suggests that the wave of new on-
line business-to-business activities is far from cresting.  Corporate
managers more generally, rightly or wrongly, appear to remain
remarkably sanguine about the potential for innovations to continue
to enhance productivity and profits.  At least this is what is gleaned
from the projections of equity analysts, who, one must presume,
obtain most of their insights from corporate managers.  According
to one prominent survey, the three- to five-year average earnings
projections of more than a thousand analysts, though exhibiting
some signs of diminishing in recent months, have generally held
firm at a very high level.  Such expectations, should they persist,
bode well for continued strength in capital accumulation and
sustained elevated growth of structural productivity over the longer
term.
<p>
     The same forces that have been boosting growth in
structural productivity seem also to have accelerated the process of
cyclical adjustment.  Extraordinary improvements in business-to-
business communication have held unit costs in check, in part by
greatly speeding up the flow of information.  New technologies for
supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing imply that
businesses can perceive imbalances in inventories at a very early
stage--virtually in real time--and can cut production promptly in
response to the developing signs of unintended inventory building.  
<p>   
     Our most recent experience with some inventory backup, of
course, suggests that surprises can still occur and that this process
is still evolving.  Nonetheless, compared with the past, much
progress is evident.  A couple of decades ago, inventory data would
not have been available to most firms until weeks had elapsed,
delaying a response and, hence, eventually requiring even deeper
cuts in production.  In addition, the foreshortening of lead times on
delivery of capital equipment, a result of information and other
newer technologies, has engendered a more rapid adjustment of
capital goods production to shifts in demand that result from changes in firms' expectations of sales and profitability.  A
decade ago, extended backlogs on capital equipment meant a more
stretched-out process of production adjustments.
<p>
     Even consumer spending decisions have become
increasingly responsive to changes in the perceived profitability of
firms through their effects on the value of households' holdings of
equities.  Stock market wealth has risen substantially relative to
income in recent years--itself a reflection of the extraordinary surge
of innovation.  As a consequence, changes in stock market wealth
have become a more important determinant of shifts in consumer
spending relative to changes in current household income than was
the case just five to seven years ago.
<p>
     The hastening of the adjustment to emerging imbalances is
generally beneficial.  It means that those imbalances are not allowed
to build until they require very large corrections.  But the faster
adjustment process does raise some warning flags.  Although the
newer technologies have clearly allowed firms to make more
informed decisions, business managers throughout the economy
also are likely responding to much of the same enhanced body of
information.  As a consequence, firms appear to be acting in far
closer alignment with one another than in decades past.  The result
is not only a faster adjustment, but one that is potentially more
synchronized, compressing changes into an even shorter time frame.
<p>
     This very rapidity with which the current adjustment is
proceeding raises another concern, of a different nature.  While
technology has quickened production adjustments, human nature
remains unaltered.  We respond to a heightened pace of change and
its associated uncertainty in the same way we always have.  We
withdraw from action, postpone decisions, and generally hunker
down until a renewed, more comprehensible basis for acting
emerges.  In its extreme manifestation, many economic
decisionmakers not only become risk averse but attempt to
disengage from all risk.  This precludes taking any initiative,
because risk is inherent in every action.  In the fall of 1998, for
example, the desire for liquidity became so intense that financial
markets seized up.  Indeed, investors even tended to shun risk-free,
previously issued Treasury securities in favor of highly liquid,
recently issued Treasury securities.
<p>
     But even when decisionmakers are only somewhat more
risk averse, a process of retrenchment can occur.  Thus, although
prospective long-term returns on new high-tech investment may
change little, increased uncertainty can induce a higher discount of
those returns and, hence, a reduced willingness to commit liquid
resources to illiquid fixed investments.
<p>
     Such a process presumably is now under way and arguably
may take some time to run its course.  It is not that underlying
demand for Internet, networking, and communications services has
become less keen.  Instead, as I noted earlier, some suppliers seem
to have reacted late to accelerating demand, have overcompensated
in response, and then have been forced to retrench--a not-unusual
occurrence in business decisionmaking.
<p>
     A pace of change outstripping the ability of people to adjust
is just as evident among consumers as among business
decisionmakers.  When consumers become less secure in their jobs
and finances, they retrench as well.
<p>
     It is difficult for economic policy to deal with the abruptness
of a break in confidence.  There may not be a seamless transition
from high to moderate to low confidence on the part of businesses,
investors, and consumers.  Looking back at recent cyclical episodes, we see that the change in attitudes has often been sudden.  In
earlier testimony, I likened this process to water backing up against
a dam that is finally breached.  The torrent carries with it most
remnants of certainty and euphoria that built up in earlier periods.
<p>
     This unpredictable rending of confidence is one reason that
recessions are so difficult to forecast.  They may not be just
changes in degree from a period of economic expansion, but a
different process engendered by fear.  Our economic models have
never been particularly successful in capturing a process driven in
large part by nonrational behavior.
<p>
     Although consumer confidence has fallen, at least for now it
remains at a level that in the past was consistent with economic
growth.  And as I pointed out earlier, expected earnings growth
over the longer-run continues to be elevated.  If the forces
contributing to long-term productivity growth remain intact, the
degree of retrenchment will presumably be limited.  Prospects for
high productivity growth should, with time, bolster both
consumption and investment demand.  Before long in this scenario,
excess inventories would be run off to desired levels.
<p>
     Still, as the FOMC noted in its last announcement, for the
period ahead, downside risks predominate.  In addition to the
possibility of a break in confidence, we don't know how far the
adjustment of the stocks of consumer durables and business capital
equipment has come.  Also, foreign economies appear to be
slowing, which could damp demands for exports; and, although
some sectors of the financial markets have improved in recent
weeks, continued lender nervousness still is in evidence in other
sectors.   
<p>
     Because the advanced supply-chain management and
flexible manufacturing technologies may have quickened the pace of
adjustment in production and incomes and correspondingly
increased the stress on confidence, the Federal Reserve has seen the
need to respond more aggressively than had been our wont in
earlier decades.  Economic policymaking could not, and should not,
remain unaltered in the face of major changes in the speed of
economic processes.  Fortunately, the very advances in technology
that have quickened economic adjustments have also enhanced our
capacity for real-time surveillance.
<p>
     As I pointed out earlier, demand has been depressed by the
rise in energy prices as well as by the needed slowing in the pace of
accumulation of business capital and consumer durable assets.  The
sharp rise in energy costs pressed down on profit margins still
further in the fourth quarter.  About a quarter of the rise in total
unit costs of nonfinancial, nonenergy corporations reflected a rise in
energy costs.  The 12 percent rise in natural gas prices last quarter
contributed directly, and indirectly through its effects on the cost of
electrical power generation, about one-fourth of the rise in overall
energy costs for nonfinancial, non-energy corporations; increases in
oil prices accounted for the remainder.
<p>
     In addition, a significant part of the margin squeeze not
directly attributable to higher energy costs probably has reflected
the effects of the moderation in consumer outlays that, in turn, has
been due in part to higher costs of energy, especially for natural
gas.  Hence, it is likely that energy cost increases contributed
significantly more to the deteriorating profitability of nonfinancial,
non-energy corporations in the fourth quarter than is suggested by
the energy-related rise in total unit costs alone.
<p>
     To be sure, the higher energy expenses of households and
most businesses represent a transfer of income to producers of
energy.  But the capital investment of domestic energy producers,
and, very likely, consumption by their owners, have provided only a
small offset to the constraining effects of higher energy costs on
spending by most Americans.  Moreover, a significant part of the
extra expense is sent overseas to foreign energy producers, whose
demand for exports from the United States is unlikely to rise
enough to compensate for the reduction in domestic spending,
especially in the short-run.  Thus, given the evident inability of
energy users, constrained by intense competition for their own
products, to pass on much of their cost increases, the effects of the
rise in energy costs does not appear to have had broad inflationary
effects, in contrast to some previous episodes when inflation
expectations were not as well anchored.  Rather, the most
prominent effects have been to depress aggregate demand.  The
recent decline in energy prices and further declines anticipated by
futures markets, should they occur, would tend to boost purchasing
power and be an important factor supporting a recovery in demand
growth over coming quarters.
<p>
<b>Economic Projections</b><br>
     The members of the Board of Governors and the Reserve
Bank presidents foresee an implicit strengthening of activity after
the current rebalancing is over, although the central tendency of
their individual forecasts for real GDP still shows a substantial
slowdown, on balance, for the year as a whole.  The central
tendency for real GDP growth over the four quarters of this year is
2 to 2-1/2 percent.  Because this average pace is below the rise in
the economy's potential, they see the unemployment rate increasing
to about 4-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter of this year.  The
central tendency of their forecasts for inflation, as measured by the
prices for personal consumption expenditures, suggests an
abatement to 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent over this year from 2-1/2
percent over 2000.
<p>
<b>Government Debt Repayment and the Implementation of
Monetary Policy</b><br>
     Federal budget surpluses have bolstered national saving,
providing additional resources for investment and, hence,
contributing to the rise in the capital stock and our standards of
living.  However, the prospective decline in Treasury debt
outstanding implied by projected federal budget surpluses does
pose a challenge to the implementation of monetary policy.  The
Federal Reserve has relied almost exclusively on increments to its
outright holdings of Treasury securities as the "permanent" asset
counterpart to the uptrend in currency in circulation, our primary
liability.  Because the market for Treasury securities is going to
become much less deep and liquid if outstanding supplies shrink as
projected, we will have to turn to acceptable substitutes.  Last year
the Federal Reserve System initiated a study of alternative
approaches to managing our portfolio.
<p>
     At its late January meeting, the FOMC discussed this issue
at length, and it is taking several steps to help better position the
Federal Reserve to address the alternatives.  First, as announced on
January 31, the Committee extended the temporary authority, in
effect since late August 1999, for the Trading Desk at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York to conduct repurchase agreements in
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the agencies as well as in
Treasuries and direct agency debt.  Thus, for the time being, the
Desk will continue to rely on the same types of temporary open
market operations in use for the past year and a half to offset
transitory factors affecting reserve availability.
<p>
     Second, the FOMC is examining the possibility of beginning
to acquire under repurchase agreements some additional assets that
the Federal Reserve Act already authorizes the Federal Reserve to
purchase.  In particular, the FOMC asked the staff to explore the
possible mechanisms for backing our usual repurchase operations
with the collateral of certain debt obligations of U.S. states and
foreign governments.  We will also be consulting with the Congress
on these possible steps before the FOMC further considers such
transactions.  Taking such assets in repurchase operations would
significantly expand and diversify the assets our counterparties
could post in temporary open market operations, reducing the
potential for any impact on the pricing of private sector
instruments. 
<p>
     Finally, the FOMC decided to study further the even longer-term issue of whether it will ultimately be necessary to expand the
use of the discount window or to request the Congress for a
broadening of its statutory authority for acquiring assets via open
market operations.  How quickly the FOMC will need to address
these longer-run portfolio choices will depend on how quickly the
supply of Treasury securities declines as well as the usefulness of
the alternative assets already authorized by law.
<p>
     In summary, although a reduced availability of Treasury
securities will require adjustments in the particular form of our open
market operations, there is no reason to believe that we will be
unable to implement policy as required.
