<h3><a name="11"></a>Field and Office Activities</h3>
<h4><a name="12"></a>Preliminary Research</h4>
<p>The soil survey party leader should arrive in the area before soil mapping 
begins and generally before the other party members do. This allows the party 
leader time to become familiar with the area, review preliminary data, 
investigate the major soils and their pattern of occurrence, review the stated 
purposes of the survey, check the adequacy of the base map material, and prepare 
a preliminary mapping legend. During the general premapping appraisal of the 
survey area, the party leader also assembles the information needed to schedule 
survey operations. </p>
<p>A well-established principle of research is to assemble the existing 
information about a subject first. Time and effort are saved and costly errors 
are avoided if what is already known is used. The time required to find and 
appraise existing information is usually small relative to the time required to 
compensate for failure to use the information. Even for areas about which little 
is thought to be known, a diligent search usually uncovers useful information. 
In addition, information about adjacent areas can often be applied to the survey 
area. </p>
<p>If an older soil survey has been made, it is generally the most important 
reference available. Soil surveys made in the United States before 1920 
emphasized the character of the parent material. The maps commonly provide some 
of the best information available for dividing the survey area into sections 
within which parent material is reasonably uniform. Many soil surveys made 
between 1920 and 1930 provide most of the information needed to broadly 
characterize the area and its soils. Those made between 1930 and 1940 provide a 
very important part of the information needed for identifying map units. The 
earlier surveys are also useful for identifying map units, but they must be used 
in conjunction with a systematic preliminary field study. It is helpful to 
examine mapping and examples of established soil series in nearby areas that 
have been recently surveyed. </p>
<p>Unpublished soil surveys of scattered farms are another source of information 
about the area. The value of this information depends on the quality of the 
legend and consistency of mapping over long periods. Regardless of the quality 
of the legend, the scattered farm mapping should not be made a part of the 
modern soil survey without careful field checking. </p>
<p>A soil survey is a study of the geography of soil. Maps detail geographic 
information. Aerial photographs, topographic maps, and other maps are useful 
references whether or not they are used as the mapping base. Each kind of map 
shows features that the others do not. </p>
<p>Topographic maps are the best references for appraising relief for most 
areas. Maps and texts on geology for many areas have been published by the U.S. 
Geological Survey and by comparable State agencies. The publications are on 
various subjects, such as bedrock geology, surficial deposits, and water or 
mineral resources. The maps were made at various scales and degrees of detail. 
Almost all contain important information about the parent material of soils and 
related factors. Although not as extensive as for geology, maps showing 
vegetation have been published for many areas. The U.S. Forest Service and State 
agencies are likely sources. In addition, climatic maps that are commonly at 
small scale and general in nature are available. The cartographic staff of the 
Soil Conservation Service, local libraries, and university libraries are good 
sources of information about what has been published and where it can be 
obtained. </p>
<p>Local sources—libraries of local schools, universities, municipals, 
historical societies, State agencies—are sources of published material on soils, 
agriculture, geology, geomorphology, hydrology, climate, engineering, biology, 
history, and related subjects. If a university is located within reasonable 
distance of a survey area, graduate theses may provide significant material. 
Local weather stations can provide data on temperature, precipitation, and other 
weather events. Reports of the Bureau of the Census and of <acronym title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</acronym>'s Economic 
Research Service and National Agricultural Statistics Service are authoritative 
references on land use and crop production. A computerized bibliographic search 
service can also provide references for publications about the survey area. </p>
<p>Faculty members of universities often have information that is not available 
in published form or know of published information that the party leader has not 
found. The local representatives of the Cooperative Extension System, area and 
district conservationists of <acronym title="Soil Conservation Service">SCS</acronym>, and vocational agriculture teachers may also 
be sources of knowledge that is not generally available. Representatives of 
planning boards, sanitation departments, highway departments, and the like are 
knowledgeable about matters that are important for interpreting soils and 
designing map units. Strong working relationships with the office of the State 
geologist and with geologists working in the survey area are very important. 
They can provide much information that is helpful in understanding soil-rock 
relationships. </p>
<p>Some information not directly related to soils is also helpful in planning, 
organizing, and conducting a soil survey. Questions that should be answered 
include: </p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the present land-use pattern? Is it relatively uniform or a 
mixture of conflicting uses and intensities? Are there political or economic 
problems associated with present land uses? </li>
  <li>Is there a land-use policy or plan for the area? Is it active and 
effective? What changes in land use does it outline? </li>
  <li>What is the general ownership pattern? Is it expected to change? </li>
  <li>Are mineral rights important in the area? Who owns them? </li>
  <li>Are water rights, either ground or surface, controlled? Does water supply 
limit land use and continued growth and development? What is the quality of the 
water? </li>
  <li>What cultural, social, or economic factors influence or control land use? 
  </li>
  <li>What qualities of the area (climate, soils, mineral, and so forth) are 
unique, valuable, or limiting for some uses? </li>
</ol>
<p>Not all of these questions are universally important, nor is the list 
complete. The answer to these questions, however, can be important in satisfying 
the needs for the soil survey. </p>
<p>Promising sources of reference material have been mentioned. The amount and 
significance of existing information varies widely, but in most parts of the 
United States it is substantial. Preliminary research can provide much, if not 
most, of the information about the soils of the area and their geography that is 
needed to start field studies and prepare a preliminary mapping legend. 
Preliminary research provides the basic data for interpreting the soils. </p>
<h4><a name="13"></a>Preparing the Mapping Legend</h4>
<p>Preparing the mapping legend is the principal duty of the party leader after 
preliminary field studies have been completed. The purposes of the survey having 
been stated in the memorandum of understanding, the party leader consults with 
other specialists and determines what soil areas are significant. Soils and map 
units that can be consistently identified and mapped are then described, and 
names and symbols are proposed for them. </p>
<p>The mapping legend is composed of two parts: (1) the descriptive legend, 
which contains descriptions and classification of the soils, the identification 
legend, the legend of conventional and special symbols, and the general soil map 
and (2) mapping aids such as a genetic key, table of soil characteristics, and 
notes about individual soils or map units. The mapping legend contains the 
primary references and the principal guides for each survey party member. It is 
designed to serve the purposes of the soil survey and is unique to each area.
</p>
<p>Preliminary studies are made in a survey area to identify sets of soil 
properties that are repeated in characteristic landscapes and are mappable. Not 
all of the soil map units needed for the complete survey can be anticipated at 
the start. An initial mapping legend is prepared after preliminary 
investigations and test mapping. The initial mapping legend should include only 
the descriptive legend and mapping aids for those soils, map units, and other 
features that have been definitely identified as needed. The number of map units 
in the initial legend depends on the scope of the initial studies, complexity of 
the area, and intensity of the survey. Map units must be defined and described 
carefully. These descriptions are the guidelines for mapping soils and the 
standards against which possible additional map units are evaluated as the 
survey progresses. The mapping legend should be made available to each member of 
the party before mapping begins. It is revised as needed during the soil survey.
</p>
<p>As the survey progresses, other material is added to the mapping legend. This 
makes a soil handbook for the survey area. The soil handbook contains all of the 
information and other related facts about the genesis, morphology, 
classification, and interpretation of the soils of the survey area. By the time 
mapping is completed, the soil handbook should contain all of the material 
needed for the published soil survey. </p>
<h4><a name="14"></a>Field Operations</h4>
<p>Soil mapping is a technical art. It requires sound training in soil science 
and familiarity with the principles of the earth sciences. A skilled soil 
scientist is a perceptive observer and understands the significance of 
landscape. Subtle differences in slope gradient or configuration, in landform, 
and in vegetation can be important indicators of soil boundaries. The soil 
scientist must learn to associate sets of landscape features with sets of 
internal soil properties to be able to visualize the pattern of the soils. A 
skilled mapper is able to abstract the essentials of the soil pattern and sketch 
this pattern on a map. </p>
<p>Above all, a good soil scientist strives for accuracy and is truthful about 
the reliability of the maps. The demanding standards for soil mapping must be 
maintained throughout such a survey regardless of vegetative cover. </p>
<p>Even though the map scale is adequate and the legend is well designed, the 
legibility and usefulness of the maps depends on the skill and judgement used in 
applying the legend. Some soil boundaries are more important than others and 
require greater accuracy. Time and effort must be spent to delineate small areas 
of soil that contrast with neighboring soils. In mapping consociations, for 
example, boundaries between highly contrasting soils, such as a wet soil and a 
dry soil or a clayey soil and a sandy soil, must be located as correctly as 
possible. </p>
<p>The greatest time and effort is spent delineating dissimilar soils that are 
more limiting for use than nearby soils. Small areas of some soils are 
deliberately mapped with their more extensive neighbors if the two kinds perform 
similarly for the purpose of the survey. Useless detail is avoided. Special 
symbols are used to indicate significant areas too small to be delineated. The 
skill and judgment of the mapper are part of the art of separating the landscape 
into meaningful units of soil and then recording the units on a map. </p>
<p><strong>Using Aerial Photographs</strong>.—Aerial photographs provide important clues about 
kinds of soil from the shape and color of the surface and the vegetation. The 
relationships between patterns of soil and patterns of images on photographs can 
be learned for an area. These relationships can be used to predict the location 
of soil boundaries and kinds of soil within them. </p>
<p>Light and dark tone on panchromatic photographs and color differences on 
color photographs, for example, are records of light reflected when the 
photographs were taken. These records must be interpreted by relating the visual 
pattern on the photographs to soil characteristics found by inspection on the 
ground. Using the aerial photographs of an area, a soil scientist learns many 
relationships between the photographic images and soil and landscape features, 
but many uncertainties inevitably remain. Awareness of the factors that affect 
an image is required to interpret the aerial photographs as fully as possible.
</p>
<p>The techniques used to predict specific kinds of surface features, landforms, 
attributes of soils, and soil boundaries from photographs are continually being 
refined. Published material provides information about the techniques and the 
kinds of clues used by photo interpreters. Some publications provide helpful 
illustrations of specific features. Nevertheless, reliable predictions of many 
features in a particular area require experience in relating the images on the 
photographs to what is actually on the ground. </p>
<p>Such features, as roads, railroads, buildings, lakes, rivers, field 
boundaries, and many kinds of vegetation can be recognized on aerial 
photographs. </p>
<p>Relief can be perceived by stereoscopic study. Shadows and differences in 
tone between slopes that faced the sun and those that did not at the time of 
photography also help show relief. Relief features help locate many soil 
boundaries on the map. Relief also identifies many kinds of landforms which are 
commonly related to kinds of soil. </p>
<p>Many landforms—terraces, flood plains, sand dunes, kames, eskers—can be 
identified and delineated reliably from their shapes, relative heights, and 
slopes. Their relationship to streams and other landforms provide additional 
clues. The soil scientist must understand geomorphology to take full advantage 
of photographic imagery. </p>
<p>Some landforms are less easily identified, but most images contain clues that 
narrow the choices of the kinds of landforms represented. Experience in 
interpreting tone patterns, configuration of relief, and patterns of 
drainageways commonly permits correlation of these patterns with kinds of 
geologic deposits and geomorphic features in an area. As the survey progresses, 
experience generally increases the reliability of predictions. </p>
<p>Differences in tone or color may reflect soil differences. Differences caused 
by man-imposed land use usually can be recognized by the angular shapes and 
abrupt boundaries of the areas. Other tonal differences may reflect differences 
in vegetation that relate to soil or differences in the surface of bare soil. 
Certain patterns of tone or color may reflect local soil patterns within areas 
that can be mapped in one day. Different soil associations have distinctive 
patterns that can be recognized on photographs. These patterns serve as bases 
for drawing tentative soil boundaries and for predicting kinds of soils. These 
predictions of soils and boundaries must be verified in the field. </p>
<p>Accurate soil maps cannot be produced solely by interpretation of aerial 
photographs. Time and place influence the clues on the photographs. Shades of 
gray commonly reflect the state of the soil moisture when the photograph was 
taken; but the soil moisture changes with time. Clues to soil boundaries that 
are evident on photographs taken at one time are not necessarily evident at 
another time. The activities of man have changed patterns of vegetation and 
confounded their relationships to soil patterns. The clues must be correlated 
with soil attributes for each set of photographs, and predictions of soil 
properties from such clues must be verified in the field. The accuracy of maps 
improves as fieldwork and experience increase. </p>
<p><strong>Stereoscopic examination</strong>.—Before an area is surveyed, making a careful 
stereoscopic study is helpful (fig. 4-1 (no longer available)). The area is 
scanned with a stereoscope for a general impression of farming, relief, geology, 
landforms, kinds of soils to be expected, soil moisture states, and so forth. 
Important features that can be accurately identified are sketched lightly on the 
photograph. Some features can be determined with more certainty than others. 
Images that help identify obscure features can be marked. The following steps 
are commonly used in preliminary studies. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Drainageways, streams, and ponds are tentatively sketched. </li>
  <li>Roads, buildings, and other location references are identified. </li>
  <li>If soils have been mapped along the match line with an adjacent 
photograph, the soil boundaries are transferred to the outside edge of the match 
line. Some soil boundaries can be tentatively extended onto the unmapped sheet. 
  </li>
  <li>Additional features can be lightly penciled if they can be identified with 
confidence: boundaries of flood plains and stream terraces, boundaries of wet 
areas and water, prominent landforms such as escarpments and areas of rock 
outcrop, gravel and borrow pits, ridge lines, sinkholes and wet spots. </li>
</ol>
<p>Routes of traverse can be placed during these preliminary studies. Obstacles 
can be identified and plans made to avoid them. Enough field checking is planned 
to ensure maximum accuracy with a minimum of walking per unit of area mapped.
</p>
<p>As experience is gained in an area, many soil boundaries and kinds of soil 
can be tentatively predicted on the photographs. These predictions must be 
verified in the field, but preliminary interpretation can increase the quality 
of mapping. During such preliminary studies, a map should not be cluttered with 
conjectures. Only features that can be predicted with confidence are marked. </p>
<p>After fieldwork, mapped sheets are examined again while the landscapes are 
fresh in the mind and can be related to the stereoscopic images. If considerable 
time elapses, details may be forgotten. Questions that the examination may raise 
become more difficult to resolve, and a special trip to the field may be needed. 
Because dense vegetation or other conditions may obscure the image on a 
photograph, some drainageways, slope breaks, and soil boundaries that are 
observed in the field may be impossible to place accurately on a photograph. 
These features can be sketched tentatively in the field, and their locations 
later checked by stereoscopic study for necessary revision. Thorough 
stereoscopic study of areas that have been mapped commonly reveals places where 
soil boundaries or stream symbols need to be refined to conform to relief. The 
traces of roads in heavily forested areas may be obscure on single photographs 
but evident under the stereoscope. If some boundaries inadvertently were not 
closed during field mapping, they can often be closed with confidence on the 
basis of stereoscopic study. </p>
<p>In the field, roads, houses, streams, field boundaries, individual trees or 
bushes, and the like are used to identify locations on the ground with points on 
the base map. The photograph can be oriented so that the relative position of 
its images corresponds to the relative position of ground features from the 
vantage point of the surveyor. The photographic images of surface features that 
mark soil boundaries can be followed in the sketches of the boundaries. 
Boundaries that are not evident on the photograph can be sketched in relation to 
identifiable ground features. </p>
<p>In some areas a stereoscope used in the field with stereoscopic pairs of 
photographs is helpful. A pocket stereoscope can be used on the hood of a 
vehicle or on a dropleaf shelf (fig. 4-2 (no longer available)). It can be 
carried while walking. The stereoscope and pairs of photographs can be used to 
relate the landscape features to the stereoscopic images. Kinds of soils and the 
location of boundaries can be predicted from the stereoscopic image. Boring or 
digging is needed to identify soils positively and to verify predictions, but 
stereoscopic study commonly reduces the number of borings that are needed to 
locate the boundaries of an area. </p>
<p><strong>Plotting soil boundaries</strong>.—A soil scientist plans the day's work as a series 
of trips across the area to be mapped. Proceeding along these routes, the soil 
scientist predicts soil areas, the kinds of soil in the areas, and the 
boundaries that separate different kinds of soil. These predictions are checked 
as the areas are crossed. Finally, boundaries and kinds of soils are plotted on 
the map. Thus, fieldwork consists of a sequence of predictions and 
verifications. </p>
<p>To the extent feasible, mapping is scheduled to proceed systematically across 
contiguous areas. When mapping is resumed each day, the mapping of the previous 
day provides points of reference. The boundaries that were projected tentatively 
the day before are predictions to be verified. The soil patterns and the clues 
for interpreting the landscape are already understood. Mapping systematically 
across contiguous areas contributes greatly to both efficiency and quality of 
the work. </p>
<p>Ground traverses are planned to cross as many soil areas as possible. Soil 
areas generally conform to the orientation of relief, which is commonly related 
to drainage courses. Consequently, most soil areas and most soil boundaries can 
be crossed by traveling at an angle to the secondary or tertiary drainage 
courses. The traverses are spaced so that the boundaries that are identified and 
projected on one traverse can be identified and continued on the next. Traverse 
spacing depends on the complexity of the soil pattern, visibility, and amount of 
detail required by the survey objectives. In fairly detailed surveys, for 
example, traverses are planned to pass within 200 to 400 meters of every point 
in the area, thereby permitting detection of small areas of contrasting soils.
</p>
<p>Where aerial photographs are used as the mapping base, a predetermined line 
of traverse need not be followed consistently if there are sufficient reference 
points for accurate location. A traverse can deviate from a planned route to 
cross landscape features that may be marks of soil boundaries. Wandering from 
place to place at random, however, should be avoided. Aerial photographs assist 
in avoiding obstacles on the route. If boundaries are observed to run in a 
different direction than had been anticipated, the plan can be adjusted. </p>
<p>From any point of observation, the soil scientist looks along the projected 
route and predicts the kinds of soils on the landscape ahead. A break in slope 
gradient, a change from convex to concave slope configuration, a change in the 
color of the surface of a plowed field, the margin of a swamp or forest, the 
edge of a stony area, a change in kind or vigor of crops—these observable 
features can be related to soil boundaries. If possible, these features are 
identified on the aerial photograph. Some may already have been marked during 
the stereoscopic examination. If soil boundaries follow identifiable features, 
they are lightly traced on the photograph in pencil. Boundaries that are not 
evident on the photograph are sketched on the map in relation to identifiable 
features. Most features must be located and sketched by estimating location in 
relation to the point of observation and other known points. Tentative soil 
boundaries are sketched for perhaps 100 to 200 meters ahead and on either side 
of the point of observation. Natural and cultural features that are immediately 
ahead, such as a stream or drainageway, are also sketched on the aerial 
photograph. </p>
<p>Some soil boundaries are sharply defined (<a href="#fig4-3">fig. 4-3</a>). Others are plotted as 
lines midway in zones of gradual transition from one soil to another (<a href="#fig4-4">fig. 4-4</a>). 
A judgment is made about whether a broad transition zone is a discrete mappable 
soil unit or should be split and its parts included with the soils on either 
side. Every part of the mapped area must be enclosed in a boundary and assigned 
a symbol. </p>
<p>After predictions are made about the soil areas and boundaries are sketched 
on the map, the soil scientist walks across the predicted boundaries. The course 
is adjusted as necessary to investigate the transitional zone and any unusual 
features. Slope gradient is estimated or measured with an Abney level or a 
clinometer. As a predicted soil boundary is approached, especially in a broad 
transitional zone, the soil is examined to locate the significant changes in 
soil properties. </p>
<p>As a projected delineation is crossed, the distribution of microdepressions, 
microknolls, tiny areas of different vegetation, convexities and concavities, 
and other features too small to delineate are observed. The soil is examined at 
a place where the microfeatures suggest that the predicted dominant soil should 
be best expressed; and this portion of the delineation is identified positively. 
The prediction may be confirmed, or a different kind of soil may be found. Where 
microfeatures suggest important inclusions, additional observations are made to 
ensure that the evaluation of the whole delineation is good. Sites for 
examination are not chosen at random if reasons exist for dividing the projected 
delineation into parts that are the predicted soils and parts that are not. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The number of places at which observations are made depends on the certainty 
of the predictions and the objectives of the survey. If predictions about the 
kind of landscape under examination have been valid many times before, soils 
need be examined in only a few places. If the landscape features have not been 
consistently related to kinds of soils, many places must be examined. The depth 
of the examinations depends on the depth of differentiating criteria for the map 
unit and on the confidence in the predictions about the kind and uniformity of 
soil material at a given depth. The examination itself is rapid and is mostly a 
search for a few properties that identify the soil. A small sample of a pedon is 
observed; seldom is an entire pedon studied. </p>
<p>After a delineation has been identified and crossed, the soil scientist turns 
and looks back on the landscape from a new vantage point. A final judgement is 
made on the boundaries and symbols. If mapping is done on an aerial photograph, 
the photographic images are checked against the landscape features before the 
final boundaries are sketched. </p>
<p>Soil boundaries are projected on either side of the traverse as far as they 
can be seen and identified with reasonable certainty. The ends of their 
projections are checked from the next traverse. Many boundaries can be seen 
throughout their lengths. Other boundaries can be predicted on the aerial 
photographs with a high degree of certainty. In forests, for example, visibility 
may be a few tens of meters or less; but, where a slope break that marks a soil 
boundary can be seen under the stereoscope, the boundary can be plotted much 
more accurately by a study of the photographs than by an observation on the 
ground. A soil boundary that is found at one point to correspond to a change in 
color on the photograph is commonly continued along the change on the photograph 
even though the boundary itself is not visible on the ground during mapping. In 
detailed soil mapping many boundaries between traverses are drawn on the basis 
of variations in the photographic image. </p>
<p>In mapping, a pattern of soils and landscapes is conceived, rather than a 
group of individual map units. Certain soils are typically found together. The 
number of soils in any locality is usually small. </p>
<p>In most places landscape features mark the kinds of soils. But landscape 
features do not identify soils everywhere, and by no means can all internal soil 
properties that are used to define map units be correlated with external 
features. Where soil boundaries cannot be predicted with confidence, they may be 
identified by direct examination of the soil. </p>
<p>In some areas, important attributes of the subsoil or substratum are not 
related to surface features. Depth to bedrock, layers of contrasting texture, 
salt in the substratum, and similar attributes may have no visible relationship 
to the vegetation or other natural features but may be important when the soil 
is used. When desert is irrigated, when wet soils are drained, or when highways 
are built, soil differences that are not reflected in landscape variations may 
become important. </p>
<p>Conditions of this kind occur in most survey areas. If common mapping 
techniques are used, the predictions frequently turn out to be inaccurate for 
some areas. Unless the mapper can reappraise the landscape and reliably predict 
the extent of the soil, the boundaries must be determined by actual examination.
</p>
<p>In large areas where landscape has low predictive value, geologic history and 
geomorphology may provide guides to stratigraphy, depth, and distribution of the 
kinds of rocks that are related to specific soils. The general hydrology of an 
area may indicate where salt-charged water has moved and where the salt has 
concentrated. Streams and their traces help in locating areas that have layers 
that differ in texture. As much preliminary information as possible is assembled 
to help determine the pattern and scale of soil variability. This information 
helps in planning the route and spacing of traverses and the spacing of samples 
within the traverses. </p>
<p>In survey areas that are to be irrigated, samples of critical layers may be 
taken for special field-testing or examination to determine boundaries. These 
samples may be taken at points on a predetermined grid or at predetermined 
points along lines of a traverse. </p>
<p>Where internal properties of soils are used for locating boundaries, a 
predetermined line of traverse is generally followed. Side trips are made 
wherever landscape features or experience with the soil pattern indicates that 
there is probably a significant soil change between traverses. Generally, the 
soil is examined at some standard interval along the traverse to locate 
important differences. If properties deep in the soil are important, the plan 
may require observations at fixed depth-intervals to a certain depth, such as 1 
meter, and with layer depth intervals to greater depth. </p>
<p>In most areas, some feature of the landscape or some aspect of the pattern of 
soils already mapped on an adjacent traverse provides a basis for predicting the 
location of soil boundaries. As evidence of change is observed, preliminary 
observations are made. Where the evidence indicates an important soil boundary, 
the soil is examined in more detail or to a greater depth to verify the 
prediction. </p>
<p>Where power equipment can be moved freely across the countryside, it can be 
used to examine the soil to considerable depth at close spacing. Map units that 
are based on soil properties deep below the surface can be delineated with 
increased accuracy and the rate of progress can be greater if the geographic 
distribution of these properties is consistent with the scale of mapping. </p>
<p>Neither standard intervals between traverses nor intervals for investigating 
the soil within traverses can be specified with certainty. The plan is adjusted 
to the direction and scale of the soil boundaries and the variability of the 
important properties. This kind of evidence is commonly obtained as the survey 
progresses, and the mapping plan can be altered to fit the accumulated evidence.
</p>
<p>A great deal of skill and judgement is required in areas of low 
predictability. Rarely are the soils at two sample sites exactly alike. Study of 
a single site is not enough to identify a significant area. Map units are 
defined to include the variability within areas large enough to be meaningful 
for the objectives of the survey. Using preconceived ideas of significant limits 
of definitive properties to define map units without regard to their geographic 
distribution generally results in unmappable units. Meaningless boundaries may 
result. Delineations should show the pattern and scale of orderly variation of 
soils. The kinds of variability over short distances should be noted in the 
descriptions of the map units. </p>
<p>In all soil surveys distinctive landscapes are outlined on the map first. In 
surveys where most map units are fairly large and contain more than one kind of 
soil, landscape patterns are identified mainly by interpretation of aerial 
photographs, by aerial observation, and by study of topographic maps, geologic 
maps, land-use maps, and other available information. The size of the outlined 
areas depends on the objectives of the survey and the landscape pattern. 
Preliminary areas are of course no smaller than the smallest delineation that 
will appear on the soil map. They are often much larger. In 3rd-, 4th-, and 
5th-order surveys, however, most map units are made up of more than one kind of 
soil or miscellaneous area and usually coincide with the landscapes outlined in 
preliminary work. </p>
<p>Traverses of the preliminary delineations may be desirable, depending on the 
level of generalization required for the survey and the complexity of the soil 
patterns. The plan of traverses usually is based on interpretations of 
photographs, but this plan should be tested in the field. </p>
<p>In areas of low accessibility, roads or trails may be traveled; but the 
mapper must understand that roads and trails commonly follow the easiest routes 
and avoid the steepest slopes, the wettest areas, and the other places that are 
difficult to cross. Such places are integral parts of soil associations and 
should be observed by the mapper on the ground. </p>
<p>Transects are commonly used to determine the composition of map units. In 
transecting, a planned line of travel is followed as closely as possible and the 
soils are observed at predetermined regular intervals. </p>
<p>In transecting, routes of travel are systematically planned to give a valid 
sample of the area. Taxa phases and other features are identified and recorded. 
Distances or number of points along the route identified by each taxon provides 
estimates of the composition of the map units. In surveys without easily 
predictable patterns, soils are sampled most efficiently if the transect lines 
are selected at random. Lines oriented to cross the drainage pattern often 
provide the most information about the pattern of soils. </p>
<p>Sample blocks, instead of transects, are used in some surveys to determine 
the composition of map units. Blocks do not replace transects, however, they 
permit one to observe spatial patterns not always evident from transects. 
Sampling by transects is usually more efficient than block sampling for 
estimating map unit composition. </p>
<p>Methods for sampling by blocks vary among soil surveys. One method imposes a 
grid of appropriate divisions on the entire area. Grid segments are numbered, 
and sample blocks are selected by drawing numbers at random. Each sample block 
is remapped in greater detail, and the area of each kind of soil is measured. 
These data provide estimates of the kinds and proportions of soils in each map 
unit. The number of blocks and their sizes are determined by statistical 
principles with consideration of mapping scale, the limits of confidence 
required for the survey, the general pattern of soils, and the relative size of 
soil areas. </p>
<p>Mapping of organic soils follows the same general principles as mapping of 
mineral soils. Organic soils, however, have some special relationships to 
landscape and vegetation. These relationships affect mapping of organic soils at 
all levels. </p>
<p>In preparing the mapping legend, systematic investigation of organic soils is 
required as for other kinds of soils. A thorough knowledge of the genesis of 
organic soils is required, as well as high-quality imagery and appropriate 
tools. </p>
<p>The kind of organic soil in many areas is closely related to the kind and 
pattern of native vegetation. Since many areas of organic soils are 
comparatively undisturbed, reliable relationships between soils and plant 
communities can be established. Thus, high-quality imagery from aerial 
photography and other forms of remote sensing can be very useful in preparing 
legends and in mapping these soils. </p>
<p>Where organic soils have formed directly on a mineral substratum, the 
environment may be rather uniform over extensive areas. Although the kind of 
organic material can vary with depth because of changes in climate over the 
period in which the soils have formed and because of differences in rate of 
decomposition that result from the accumulation of the organic material, such 
variations commonly are uniform over large areas. The properties of a large area 
of organic soils, therefore, can be accurately estimated from the properties of 
a small sample. </p>
<p>Organic soils are not uniform in some areas that have microrelief of hummocks 
and swales. The hummocks commonly contain fibric material, and the swales 
contain hemic and sapric material. In such landscapes, many more sites must be 
examined to determine the nature of the soils. </p>
<p>These relationships and processes generally apply where organic soils are 
formed by lake filling. Each basin in which organic soils have formed has a 
unique local environment, and the organic soils in adjacent basins may differ 
considerably. This is particularly true in irregular glacial moraines. For 
example, limnic materials may be covered by only a thin mantle of organic 
material in some basins and by several meters of organic material in others. </p>
<p>Areal relationship must be kept in mind when estimating the extent of the 
different soil components within basins, particularly small basins. For example, 
one kind of organic soil occupying a rather narrow fringe of a bog may cover a 
greater area than the organic soil in the center. </p>
<p>In northern glaciated areas in particular, organic soils may form around the 
edges of swamps that have open water in the center while adjacent swamps lack 
surface water. </p>
<p>In some areas, a layer of water can underlie the organic soils at a 
relatively shallow depth. Such areas may not support much weight and should be 
investigated with caution. </p>
<p>Organic soils of some coastal wetlands lack distinctive landscape features 
and, additionally, are poorly accessible. In these areas, the soil scientist 
relies on other features to predict kinds of soils. Patterns and kinds of soils 
in many coastal areas can be related to the position of such natural features as 
shores, deltas, streams, and adjoining higher lands. The soil scientist must 
have a thorough knowledge of the geomorphic history of the area in order to make 
reasonable predictions related to such features and to determine the places 
where transects and other field checks will best verify the predictions. </p>
<h4><a name="15"></a>Completing Field Sheets</h4>
<p>Most soil survey field sheets are individual photographs or compiled 
photobase maps. As each field sheet is completed it is joined with adjacent 
sheets and checked for errors. </p>
<p><strong>Joining field sheets</strong>.—Each pair of adjacent field sheets shares a common 
match line. During mapping, soil boundaries are commonly extended beyond the 
match line to be transferred to the adjacent sheet; but when the field sheet is 
completed, soil boundaries and other features may be discontinued at the match 
line. The mapping on each field sheet should be carefully matched with that on 
adjacent sheets to check boundaries and delineations. Roads and streams also 
should be continuous from one sheet to another. Special care is needed at the 
corners where four field sheets join. </p>
<p>If soil boundaries are sketched on overlays, field sheets are matched before 
soil lines are transferred to the soils overlay. Matching should be completed 
while the photographic background is available. </p>
<p>The mapping on one field sheet can be matched with that on an adjacent sheet 
in several ways. For aerial photographs, the mapped field sheet and an adjoining 
unmapped field sheet can be placed under the stereoscope and the images meshed. 
The soil boundaries and other features on both sides of the match line can then 
be transferred from the completed field sheet to the unmapped sheet. </p>
<p>Another method, that is particularly useful if adjoining sheets vary in 
scale, is to transfer boundaries by reference to the photographic images. The 
relationship of the soil boundaries to images of isolated trees, clumps of 
bushes, field corners, and the like are observed along the match-line. Images of 
the same features are located along the match line of the adjoining photograph, 
and the boundaries are transferred or checked in relation to the images. </p>
<p>When the second field sheet is mapped, boundaries of delineations that cross 
the match-line may be altered. Consequently, the boundaries at the match-line 
must be rechecked after both field sheets have been completed. If different 
individuals map adjacent field sheets independently and the completed sheets are 
joined, a match indicates the uniformity of fieldwork. </p>
<p>If there is no systematic method of joining sheets, errors are easily made 
that may require additional fieldwork before the final map can be compiled. 
<a href="#fig4-5">Figure 4-5</a> illustrates some errors on unmatched field sheets. </p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Inking field sheets</strong>.—After mapping has been completed on each field sheet, it 
may be inked to provide a permanent record and to provide a map from which 
copies can be made (<a href="#fig4-6">fig. 4-6)</a>. All soil boundaries and symbols and important 
drainage features should be inked. Cultural features needed on the soil maps are 
determined before mapping starts and are specified in the legend. </p>
<p>Inks or leads that are reproducible photographically and are readable by 
automatic scanning equipment are preferred. The ink or lead used should be 
compatible with the base material, and the lines should be opaque. Several kinds 
of inks and leads are suitable. Commonly, pens that store carbon-base ink in a 
reservoir are used. </p>
<p>Several pens that make uniform lines of different thickness are needed for 
inking different features and for lettering. Line widths recommended for 
different features are indicated in the list of conventional symbols on 
<a href="#fig4-7">fig. 
4-7</a>. </p>
<p>Different groups of features generally are inked in separate operations. 
Drainage is inked first and inspected to see that individual streams are 
properly joined, matched, and classified. Then, culture is inked. The 
classification of roads and other features is checked at the same time. </p>
<blockquote>

<p class="smallnote">Example of a field sheet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soil boundaries and symbols are inked next. Finally, the place names are 
lettered. In some surveys, however, certain features may not be inked. For 
example, if the photographic image of all roads is pronounced, they do not need 
to be inked. </p>
<p>If photobase map sheets are used as field sheets, the inking can be done on 
transparent overlays. As many as three overlays can be used: one for culture and 
drainage, one for soil boundaries, and one for symbols. Together these form a 
composite overlay and can be used in printing the final map. The individual 
overlays can be used in printing special purpose maps. Adhesive-backed, clear 
stripping film with printed symbols can be applied to the overlay to save 
handwork. </p>
<p>In inking soil boundaries, a good procedure is to close each boundary within 
one section of the field sheet. When the boundary of a small area is closed, its 
symbol is placed as near the center of the area as practical. More than one 
symbol is placed in areas that extend for long distances and in those that have 
intricate shapes. </p>
<p>Mapping along the match lines may be left in pencil until the field sheets 
have been joined. </p>
<p>Soil symbols on all sheets should be positioned to be read horizontally, or 
as nearly so as possible, when the map is oriented in one direction. Usually, 
north is toward the top of the map. If an area is too small to contain a symbol, 
the symbol may be placed outside it and a leader used to indicate the area to 
which the symbol applies. The leader should be so placed that it cannot be 
confused with a soil boundary. </p>
<p>Place names should be inked last so that they may be placed where they will 
not obscure soil symbols and other details. Place names should be arranged so 
that they clearly identify their features. Names of features expressed as lines 
on the map are oriented parallel to the lines. Names of other features are 
usually oriented horizontally, with north at the top. Important features that 
serve as landmarks should be named on each sheet. Names of streams should be so 
positioned that no confusion arises about which branch is meant. Incorrect and 
correct placement of names are illustrated in <a href="#fig4-8">figure 4-8</a>. </p>

<p>Neatness and legibility are important in lettering. Maps with many soil 
symbols, boundaries, cultural features, and the like become confusing unless the 
lettering is done with special attention to high standards. Every soil scientist 
should learn the art of freehand lettering. </p>
<p>A simple style of lettering should be used. Freehand styles that use single 
strokes are best for inking field sheets. The pen is held as in writing and the 
strokes are made with an even steady motion. Slant or vertical lines are made 
with a downward stroke: horizontal lines are made with a stroke from left to 
right. The slant of the letters is kept uniform. </p>

<p><strong>Checking field sheets</strong>.—Each field sheet should be checked for open 
boundaries, areas without symbols, and other errors. Fieldworkers usually check 
their own sheets, and another person may check each sheet for completeness and 
legibility. The party leader should be responsible for checking the mapping of 
each party member. The mapping of beginners generally needs much checking. If 
different soil scientists map adjacent field sheets, the party leader can 
compare their mapping in the areas where the sheets join. During field reviews, 
supervisory soil scientists responsible for technical standards often check 
boundaries and symbols on samples of the field sheets of each soil scientist.
</p>
<p>After mapping has been completed, the party leader should check all of the 
field sheets to see if any corrections and remapping are required. Omissions and 
inconsistencies increase the cost of map construction and delay publication. In 
order of frequency, the most common mistakes are: </p>
<ol>
  <li>incorrect joining at the match-line, </li>
  <li>failure to close map unit boundaries, </li>
  <li>omission of symbols or use of symbols not identified in the legend, </li>
  <li>incorrect interpretation of cultural and drainage features, and </li>
  <li>use of incorrect place names. </li>
</ol>
<p>Failure to close soil boundaries is a common error. <a href="#fig4-9">Figure 4-9</a> has three open 
boundaries—between map units 11 and 31, between units 62 and 25, and between 
units 38 and 62. The person who inked this sheet probably overlooked the lack of 
closure because of the drainage lines and railroad symbols that cross the area. 
Whatever the cause, the user cannot tell where one unit ends and the other 
begins. Someone may have to make a special trip to the field to close these 
boundaries. </p>
<p>Each area of a mapping unit must be separated from all adjoining areas by a 
soil boundary or the boundary of a body of water. Neither the single lines 
representing streams nor the conventional symbols for roads, railroads, and the 
like can serve as map-unit boundaries. Each area also must contain the symbol 
for only one kind of map unit. </p>
<p>Errors in symbols take various forms. A delineation on a field sheet might be 
closed without a symbol in it, or a symbol not listed in the legend might be 
used. Symbols might be illegibly drawn on the field sheet. Practice and care in 
lettering, good judgement in placing symbols, and care in erasing and reinking 
mistakes ensure legibility. </p>

<p>Various methods are available for checking field sheets. A good method is to 
color each delineation by hand on photographic copies of the filed sheets. A 
color check reviews each delineation and inspects boundaries throughout their 
length. In another method, each field sheet is divided into sections of perhaps 
50 to 100 square centimeters. The delineations within each section are checked 
one at a time, special care being taken at the edges of the section. If the map 
checkers are not familiar with the legend, they must be especially diligent in 
checking the symbols against the legend.</p>
<p>Incorrect placement of drainage or cultural features on the map can seriously 
reduce the accuracy of map unit boundaries. The location of streams, roads, and 
the like must be correct. Most errors in placement cannot be checked with 
precision except by stereoscopic study or field investigation. If accurate 
reference maps are available, locations of features on the field sheets are 
checked against them. If possible, locations are checked while mapping is in 
progress. Place names are verified with an authoritative source. </p>
<p><strong>Keeping records of field sheets</strong>.—Each field sheet may be identified by a 
number that locates it on an index map of the area. The index map outlines and 
identifies all of the field sheets of the survey. Where single-lens aerial 
photographs are used, several hundred individual sheets are required and a 
systematic means of identifying their locations in the survey area is needed. 
Photographic indices are available for most areas where photographs are used. An 
index map can be made from a small-scale map by plotting the match-lines of the 
field sheets. </p>
<p>Each field sheet should contain the name of the survey area, the State, the 
date of the survey, and the names of the soil scientists who mapped that sheet. 
Names of others who inked or checked the sheet and its scale may be given also. 
Commonly, all this information can be put only on the back of the sheet. If it 
can be put on the front, it may be placed so that it will appear on photographic 
copies. A stamp can be used to provide spaces for the information. </p>
<p>The adjacent field sheets are identified on the margins of each sheet. When 
adjacent field sheets have been joined, the margins of the field sheets may be 
marked and initialed by the persons responsible. The joined match lines can also 
be marked on a transparent overlay over the map index. </p>
<p><a name="area"></a><strong>Measuring the areas of map units</strong>.—Soil maps show both the location and the 
extent of map units. Measurements of the area of each map unit are needed. 
Planners, for example, need to know the extent of areas that have certain 
potentials or problems. Processors of farm products frequently need to locate 
areas that are suited to growing a certain crop. The data on an area are used to 
help decide whether certain map units of small extent are important enough to be 
retained on the published map. Measuring the areas also checks the map for open 
boundaries, delineations without symbols, and unidentified symbols. Measurements 
on field sheets are subject to errors caused by distortion of the photographs.
</p>
<p>The area of map units can be measured for the entire survey area; or sample 
areas can be selected and the extent of map units in them measured and expanded 
to represent the entire area. </p>
<p>The accuracy of the estimate, based on sample areas, depends on the size of 
the sample and where the sample areas are located. If the sample is less than 5 
percent of the total area, estimates are subject to relatively large errors. 
Generally, the sample should be at least 10 percent of the total area. Even with 
this large a sample, map units of small extent are likely to be either missed 
entirely or overestimated. The estimates of extensive map units by sampling 
methods are likely to be reasonably reliable. Estimates based on sample areas 
can be satisfactory for most uses of data for the major soils in the survey 
area. </p>
<p>If a sampling procedure is used, dividing the area surveyed into soil 
associations and sampling each association separately is helpful. The most 
accurate estimates can be derived from sample strips running all the way across 
each association and oriented at right angles to the prominent unit boundaries. 
The strips can be spaced to provide the needed sample size. Square areas and 
rectangular areas oriented at random yield less accurate estimates, especially 
if the sample is small. </p>
<p>Several methods can be used for measuring the area of map units. The <em>dot-grid 
method</em> uses a transparent sheet or card on which dots are evenly spaced 
vertically and horizontally. Each dot on the grid represents a small square, 
which has a unit area. The transparent sheet is placed over the map and the dots 
in each delineation are counted. Dots that fall on the boundary of a delineation 
are alternately counted. The dots in each delineation are summed for the map 
unit. The land area represented by each dot can be calculated on the basis of 
the map scale and the spacing of the dots. Less extensively used are grids that 
have a network of small squares instead of dots. The squares that fall within a 
delineation are easily counted. Squares that fall on a boundary of a delineation 
are averaged during counting. The averaging depends on the judgment of the 
person who is counting. If it is carefully done, the use of squares can result 
in somewhat greater accuracy than the use of dots. The former method is more 
time consuming. </p>
<p>The dot-grid method is simple, inexpensive, efficient, and convenient. For 
these reasons, it is the method most commonly used in field offices. A 
short-coming of the dot-grid method is that it is not well adapted where there 
are long, narrow delineations on the map. It is sufficiently accurate for most 
purposes, however, because the land areas for the map units tend to be averaged 
if large areas, that is, entire field sheets, are measured. The <em>electronic area 
calculator</em> is an alternative method to the dot-grid method in that it 
electronically counts squares on a grid. By using an appropriate grid to fit the 
desired map scale and a wired pencil assembly to trace the map unit boundary, 
area can be determined easily from a numerical display. This method compares 
closely in accuracy to the dot-grid method but is much quicker and more 
convenient. It is initially much more expensive than the dot-grid method. </p>
<p>The <em>planimeter</em> is an instrument used to measure area by measuring the length 
of the boundary of the delineation. This is done by following the outline of the 
delineation with a tracer. The value indicated on the planimeter is converted to 
land area by using an appropriate conversion factor related to map scale. The 
use of the planimeter is an accurate method to measure maps, but it is very slow 
and tedious. Accuracy depends on the skill and patience of the operator and on 
the care taken to convert measured value to land areas. </p>
<p><em>Computer-based digitizing</em> systems have the capability for measuring the area 
of map units. These systems are not only very accurate but serve as an excellent 
final check for errors on field sheets—open boundaries, areas without symbols, 
and the like. They can replace color checks and other methods of checking field 
sheets. </p>
<h4><a name="16"></a>Cultural Features</h4>
<p>The various mapping agencies of the United States Government have agreed on 
standard symbols for most cultural and natural ground features that are commonly 
identified on maps. Most of the symbols used on soil maps follow these 
standards. Some soil maps show special features that are not included in the 
standard list. The symbols for these must be compatible with symbols used by 
other mapping agencies. Different symbols are not used for the same feature, nor 
is the same symbol used for different features. </p>
<p>Conventional and special map symbols must be functional and readily 
identifiable on the map. </p>
<p>Conventional signs and symbols used in soil mapping are shown on 
<a href="#fig4-7">figure 4-7</a>. 
Some of these are described in the paragraphs that follow. </p>
<p><em>Boundaries</em> of cultural features are shown on soil maps by standard 
conventional symbols. These include the boundaries of nations, states, counties 
or parishes, minor civil divisions, reservations (including Federal or State 
parks and forests), land grants, parks, and cemeteries. </p>
<p>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps are the primary source of cultural 
boundaries. Where <acronym title="United States Geological Survey">USGS</acronym> maps are not available or must be supplemented, local 
sources are used. County or State assessors, planning and zoning officials, and 
reservation superintendents are authoritative sources. Boundary monuments are 
located in the field and boundaries are plotted during soil mapping only where 
boundary location cannot be plotted accurately from references. Boundaries are 
verified as a precaution against errors. </p>
<p>Where cultural boundaries of different classes coincide, the symbol of the 
major subdivision is used, for example where a State boundary coincides with a 
county boundary the State boundary has priority. Where a boundary obviously 
follows a stream or road for a short distance, the boundary symbol may be 
omitted. In some places, the road or stream may be labeled for clarity: &quot;Road is 
county boundary&quot; or &quot;State boundary is center line of stream.&quot; </p>
<p><em>Township and range</em> numbers are shown along the margins of field sheets for 
all lands that have been sectionized. Section lines are not shown. In some 
surveys all sections corners are shown; in others, only those that have been 
located are shown. In a published soil survey, section numbers are printed in 
the approximate center of each section. Published topographic quadrangle maps 
show the land grid, though some old ones may need correction. Soil scientists 
working in an area should be familiar with the local land survey system and its 
intricacies. </p>
<p><em>Cemeteries</em> are outlined to scale on field sheets using dashed lines. The name 
is usually placed within the outline of a large cemetery and outside a smaller 
one, although the smallest cemeteries are usually indicated by a cross and not 
named. A feature such as a road or stream may serve as a boundary for a 
cemetery. </p>
<p><a name="airport"></a>The identification of <em>airports</em> and <em>landing fields</em> is optional on field 
sheets. Boundaries of large municipal, commercial, and military airports and 
landing fields are shown by the symbol for a reservation. The runway pattern is 
not delineated if it is apparent on the aerial photograph. Small airfields can 
be shown by a dashed line symbol similar to that used for a cemetery, or the 
symbol for a &quot;located object&quot; can be used and labeled. Each airfield that is 
identified is labeled by its proper name or &quot;airfield,&quot; if the name is not 
known. </p>
<p><em>Roads</em> are identified on soil survey field sheets by symbol or name. In towns 
and cities only major roads are identified. Standard emblems are used to 
designate interstate, Federal, State, and other roads. Route numbers are placed 
in the emblems. If roads are shown, a simple and explicit classification is 
used. </p>
<p>The mapping of <em>trails</em> depends on their importance for proper map orientation 
and the help they will provide in locating specific areas on the map. In 
sparsely settled areas having few readily observable landmarks, important trails 
are shown and named. In more densely populated areas where roads are common, 
trails generally are not shown. </p>
<p><em>Railroads</em> are shown on field sheets by conventional symbols. They may be 
labeled &quot;railroad&quot; or by the name of the line. Electric trolley lines both in 
urban areas and beyond city limits are shown by the standard railroad symbol and 
designated by operating name and type. In large railroad yards with parallel 
spur tracks and switches and sidings alongside single tracks, only the main 
track is shown. </p>
<p><em>Pipelines</em> are shown on soil maps if they might be important as landmarks. A 
pipeline crossing a remote section of a survey area may be important. A similar 
pipeline in a populated area may be difficult to locate accurately and may have 
little value as a landmark. If shown, a pipeline must be accurately located. </p>
<p>Trunk <em>power-transmission</em> power lines are normally not shown on field sheets 
unless they have value as landmarks. They must be individually evaluated. 
Lateral distribution systems are not shown. The symbol for power-transmission 
lines, if used, begins and terminates at towns, power stations, and survey area 
boundaries. </p>
<p><em>Levees</em> are indicated by short ticks. If a road or railroad is on the levee, 
the ticks extend from both sides of the road or railroad symbol. </p>
<p>Large permanent <em>dams</em> are shown to scale on field sheets. Thin lines are used 
to delineate the base of the dam. Smaller dams are indicated by single, heavy 
lines. A road following the top of a dam is shown in its correct place, and the 
road line on the upstream side is thickened to represent the dam. A dam symbol 
is inked to its scaled length. Important dams are named. </p>
<p><strong>Permanent buildings</strong>.—rural dwellings, public buildings, and farm homes—are 
shown on most published soil maps but are optional. In some areas, buildings are 
constructed so rapidly that the map is out of date before it can be published. 
In such areas, omitting symbols for all buildings other than churches and 
schools is best. In most soil surveys, churches and schools are shown on the 
published map and may be named. </p>
<p>Symbols for individual houses are commonly not shown in urban areas. 
Prominent landmark buildings—large schools and large churches—may be shown, but 
they are not drawn to scale and are identified by the conventional symbols. </p>
<p>The cross or pennant of a church or school symbol is oriented at right angles 
to a nearby roadway. A building used as both a school and a church is marked by 
the school symbol. If churches or schools are omitted from large urban area but 
mapped in rural areas, the notation &quot;omitted in urban areas&quot; is made on the 
legend of conventional symbols. </p>
<p><em>Open pits, mines</em>, and <em>quarries</em> smaller than the minimum area for delineation 
are shown only by conventional symbols. Larger areas are delineated, classified, 
and correlated as kinds of soil or miscellaneous areas. </p>
<p>Producing <em>oil</em> and <em>gas wells</em> may be shown. Where the number of wells is so 
large that the symbols are closely spaced on the map, the approximate outline of 
the field may be shown by dashed lines and the delineated area identified as 
&quot;oil field&quot; or &quot;gas field&quot; without the conventional symbol. </p>
<p><em>Streams</em> and <em>rivers</em> are shown on the field sheets, and perennial and 
intermittent streams are clearly differentiated. The pattern of drainage and the 
classification of the drainage must be complete. If the main drainage courses 
are identified by stereoscopic study of aerial photographs, the lines must be 
confirmed and the drainage classified in the field. Most distinct drainage 
courses more than 1 cm long on the field sheets are shown. Drainage courses are 
mapped to scale if wide enough to be shown legibly or by single lines if narrow.
</p>
<p>A <em>perennial stream</em> is one in which water flows constantly except during 
periods of unusual drought. That a stream is perennial must be verified, 
especially in semiarid and arid regions where the water in streams and 
waterholes is vitally important. </p>
<p>Mapping large rivers that change course and width from time to time is 
difficult. The shorelines shown on a soil map generally mark the areas covered 
with water for so long that little or no vegetation grows during low water and 
unvegetated riverwash persists from year to year. Areas that are covered by 
flood water for only short periods are excluded. Areas that are uncovered only 
during very low water stages are included. </p>
<p>The level of river stages varies widely, depending on characteristics of the 
river in relation to the climate of its watershed and other factors. Where the 
flow of rivers, though active for brief periods, dwindles or ceases altogether 
for many months, the normal stage is very low. Thus rivers, such as the Platte 
and much of the Rio Grande, are normally braided, and the boundaries of the 
river are usually placed at the outer limits of the area of braided channels. 
Unstabilized sediment that is washed and rewashed and supports little or no 
vegetation but persists from year to year may be identified as riverwash. Areas 
within a flood plain that can support vegetation are shown as soil. </p>
<p>Some streams, especially in areas underlain by limestone, enter abruptly into 
caverns and may flow for long distances through subterranean channels. The 
points where the streams enter and emerge are located accurately, but only the 
surface drainage is shown. </p>
<p>An <em>intermittent stream</em> is dry each year for extended periods, usually for 
more than three months. In arid and semiarid regions especially, intermittent 
streams are distinguished from perennial streams because they are not reliable 
sources of water. </p>
<p>Poorly defined water courses are not shown. Aggraded flats or valley floors 
without well-defined stream channels or scars are shown as soil. </p>
<p><em>Canals</em> and <em>ditches</em>, whether for navigation, irrigation, or drainage, are 
plotted to scale if they are wide enough. Otherwise they are shown by the 
single-line symbol. Arrows indicate the direction of flow. Generally, both the 
main ditches and important laterals of irrigation systems are shown. Large 
canals and ditches are named on the field sheets if they have names. On the map, 
canals and ditches must be distinguishable from roads. </p>
<p><em>Lakes, ponds</em>, and <em>reservations</em> are delineated to scale on field sheets. The 
boundary marks the normal water level, which may not be the shoreline observed 
and recorded at the time of the survey. Normal water level may be marked by a 
line of permanent land vegetation, but many lakes are bounded by wave-washed 
beaches above the normal water level. Many reservoirs are bounded by areas that 
are submerged when the water level is high. The shore line that is evident on 
aerial photographs may be used to delineate the normal stage of a lake, pond, or 
reservoir. If a high water level other than wave-washed beaches can be 
identified, it is shown on the map by the intermittent water symbol and is 
identified. The area between high water level and normal water level can be 
defined as a soil map unit if the area warrants it. The intermittent water 
symbol is not used in these areas. The intermittent water cover is described in 
the map unit description. </p>
<p><em>Reservoirs</em> surrounded by an impounding structure are outlined. Some 
reservoirs have flood-pool lines that are determined from available sources. 
They are shown on the map by a dashed line and given an appropriate label, such 
as &quot;approximate flood-pool line.&quot; </p>
<p>The shoreline of an island is determined at the same water stage as the 
adjoining mainland shoreline. Islands exposed at a lower stage are not shown.
</p>
<p><em>Tidal shorelines</em> present special problems. The mean high tide level 
(determined excluding the semimonthly highest tides) can be used where the land 
rises to elevations well above high tide within a short distance from the shore. 
Where broad marshes mark the transition from sea to land, the shoreline is the 
outer boundary of the area that supports plants. The soil boundaries extend to 
that line. </p>
<p>The shoreline of a body of water is not broken for wharves, piers, and 
similar structures that may be built over the water. Seawalls and retaining 
walls that are part of a shoreline are shown as the shoreline. </p>
<p><em>Intermittent lakes</em> are shown on the field sheets as kinds of soil or 
miscellaneous areas. The dashed line symbol shows the area covered by water part 
of the year. </p>
<p><em>Marshes</em> and <em>swamps</em> are mapped as soil unless they are too small to be 
delineated. If too small, they are shown by the conventional marsh or swamp 
symbol. </p>
<p><em>Springs</em> are shown on the soil map if they are important in the area. Springs 
of all kinds are shown in arid and semiarid regions. In humid regions, only 
large and dependable springs are shown. Some springs have names, which may be 
printed on the soil map. In arid regions, intermittent springs or springs that 
have salty or otherwise impotable water are so identified by notes on the map. 
Walled-in springs are shown by circles, like those for wells. A spring that is a 
source of a stream is shown by a circle where the stream symbol starts. </p>
<p><a name="wells"></a><em>Artesian wells</em> and wells for irrigation are shown on soil maps where they are 
important sources of water, as in arid and semiarid regions. Artesian wells are 
designated by a conventional symbol, whether or not they flow at the surface. In 
regions of few wells, all are shown; but in thickly settled areas that have many nonflowing artesian wells, they can be explained in the report without being 
shown on the map. </p>
<p>A <em>wet spot</em> is an area of wet soil that is too small to delineate. It is 
usually somewhat poorly drained or wetter and at least one drainage class wetter 
than the soil around it. Wet spot symbols are not placed within areas that are 
mapped as a wet soil. </p>
<p>Special symbols are used to identify small areas of various kinds of soil, 
miscellaneous areas, and special soil features. These are commonly used for 
areas that are too small to delineate but large enough to significantly 
influence use and management. If a specific kind of area is shown by special 
symbols, all such areas of that land are shown; the symbols are not to be used 
haphazardly. The symbols must be defined in terms of the kinds and size of areas 
each symbol represents. </p>
<p>In some places, the pattern of mappable areas is so complex that symbols and 
leaders clutter the map. Special symbols used with moderation reduce the 
congestion of lines and symbols, although many special symbols in a small area 
reduce legibility. It may be preferable to map as complexes many areas of 
intricately associated kinds of soil. </p>
<p>Special symbols show relief features that are too small to show as map units; 
for example, <em>bedrock escarpments, short steep slopes</em>, and <em>gullies</em>. Natural 
depressions or sinks such as those common to limestone areas, may be shown by 
the <em>depression</em> or <em>sink symbol</em>. Small areas of <em>rock outcrop</em> in an area of 
otherwise deep soil are obstacles to tillage and should be shown. In addition, 
small areas of <em>saline</em> soil and <em>very stony</em> soil, in areas otherwise suitable for 
crops should be shown. Special symbols are used for small areas of some kinds of 
soil that contrast sharply with surrounding soils in their management needs or 
productivity, even though they are suited to the same uses. Small areas of 
<em>gravelly</em> soil in gravel-free areas, <em>sand spots</em> in areas of finer textured soil, 
and small areas of severely or moderately eroded soil in areas of noneroded soil 
are examples. </p>
