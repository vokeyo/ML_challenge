Sec. 1.43-2  Qualified enhanced oil recovery project.

    (a) Qualified enhanced oil recovery project. A ``qualified enhanced 
oil recovery project'' is any project that meets all of the following 
requirements--
    (1) The project involves the application (in accordance with sound 
engineering principles) of one or more qualified tertiary recovery 
methods (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) that is 
reasonably expected to result in more than an insignificant increase in 
the amount of crude oil that ultimately will be recovered;
    (2) The project is located within the United States (within the 
meaning of section 638(1));
    (3) The first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter for the 
project (as described in paragraph (c) of this section) occurs after 
December 31, 1990; and
    (4) The project is certified under Sec. 1.43-3.
    (b) More than insignificant increase. For purposes of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, all the facts and circumstances determine 
whether the application of a tertiary recovery method can reasonably be 
expected to result in more than an insignificant increase in the amount 
of crude oil that ultimately will be recovered. Certain information 
submitted as part of a project certification is relevant to this 
determination. See Sec. 1.43-3(a)(3)(i)(D). In no event is the 
application of a recovery method that merely accelerates the recovery of 
crude oil considered an application of one or more qualified tertiary 
recovery methods that can reasonably be expected to result in more than 
an insignificant increase in the amount of crude oil that ultimately 
will be recovered.
    (c) First injection of liquids, gases, or other matter--(1) In 
general. The ``first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter'' 
generally occurs on the date a tertiary injectant is first injected into 
the reservoir. The ``first injection of liquids, gases, or other 
matter'' does not include--
    (i) The injection into the reservoir of any liquids, gases, or other 
matter for the purpose of pretreating or preflushing the reservoir to 
enhance the efficiency of the tertiary recovery method; or
    (ii) Test or experimental injections.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the principles of 
this paragraph (c).

    Example. Injections to pretreat the reservoir. In 1989, A, the owner 
of an operating mineral interest in a property, began injecting water 
into the reservoir for the purpose of elevating reservoir pressure to 
obtain miscibility pressure to prepare for the injection of miscible gas 
in connection with an enhanced oil recovery project. In 1992, A obtains 
miscibility pressure in the reservoir and begins injecting miscible gas 
into the reservoir. The injection of miscible gas, rather than the 
injection of water, is the first injection of liquids, gases, or other 
matter into the reservoir for purposes of determining whether the first 
injection of liquids, gases, or other matter occurs after December 31, 
1990.

    (d) Significant expansion exception--(1) In general. If a project 
for which the first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter (within 
the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section) occurred before January 
1, 1991, is significantly expanded after December 31, 1990, the 
expansion is treated as a separate project for which the first injection 
of liquids, gases, or other matter occurs after December 31, 1990.
    (2) Substantially unaffected reservoir volume. A project is 
considered significantly expanded if the injection of liquids, gases, or 
other matter after December 31, 1990, is reasonably expected to result 
in more than an insignificant increase in the amount of crude oil that 
ultimately will be recovered from reservoir volume that was 
substantially unaffected by the injection of liquids, gases, or other 
matter before January 1, 1991.
    (3) Terminated projects. Except as otherwise provided in this 
paragraph (d)(3), a project is considered significantly expanded if each 
qualified tertiary recovery method implemented in the project prior to 
January 1, 1991, terminated more than 36 months before implementing an 
enhanced oil recovery project that commences after December 31, 1990. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, if a project 
implemented prior to January 1, 1991, is terminated for less than 36

[[Page 184]]

months before implementing an enhanced oil recovery project that 
commences after December 31, 1990, a taxpayer may request permission to 
treat the project that commences after December 31, 1990, as a 
significant expansion. Permission will not be granted if the Internal 
Revenue Service determines that a project was terminated to make an 
otherwise nonqualifying project eligible for the credit. For purposes of 
section 43, a qualified tertiary recovery method terminates at the point 
in time when the method no longer results in more than an insignificant 
increase in the amount of crude oil that ultimately will be recovered. 
All the facts and circumstances determine whether a tertiary recovery 
method has terminated. Among the factors considered is the project plan, 
the unit plan of development, or other similar plan. A tertiary recovery 
method is not necessarily terminated merely because the injection of the 
tertiary injectant has ceased. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), a 
project is implemented when costs that will be taken into account in 
determining the credit with respect to the project are paid or incurred.
    (4) Change in tertiary recovery method. If the application of a 
tertiary recovery method or methods with respect to an enhanced oil 
recovery project for which the first injection of liquids, gases, or 
other matter occurred before January 1, 1991, has not been terminated 
for more than 36 months, a taxpayer may request a private letter ruling 
from the Internal Revenue Service whether the application of a different 
tertiary recovery method or methods after December 31, 1990, that does 
not affect reservoir volume substantially unaffected by the previous 
tertiary recovery method or methods, is treated as a significant 
expansion. All the facts and circumstances determine whether a change in 
tertiary recovery method is treated as a significant expansion. Among 
the factors considered are whether the change in tertiary recovery 
method is in accordance with sound engineering principles and whether 
the change in method will result in more than an insignificant increase 
in the amount of crude oil that would be recovered using the previous 
method. A more intensive application of a tertiary recovery method after 
December 31, 1990, is not treated as a significant expansion.
    (5) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (d).

    Example 1. Substantially unaffected reservoir volume. In January 
1988, B, the owner of an operating mineral interest in a property, began 
injecting steam into the reservoir in connection with a cyclic steam 
enhanced oil recovery project. The project affected only a portion of 
the reservoir volume. In 1992, B begins cyclic steam injections with 
respect to reservoir volume that was substantially unaffected by the 
previous cyclic steam project. Because the injection of steam into the 
reservoir in 1992 affects reservoir volume that was substantially 
unaffected by the previous cyclic steam injection, the cyclic steam 
injection in 1992 is treated as a separate project for which the first 
injection of liquids, gases, or other matter occurs after December 31, 
1990.
    Example 2. Tertiary recovery method terminated more than 36 months. 
In 1982, C, the owner of an operating mineral interest in a property, 
implemented a tertiary recovery project using cyclic steam injection as 
a method for the recovery of crude oil. The project was certified as a 
tertiary recovery project for purposes of the windfall profit tax. In 
May 1988, the application of the cyclic steam tertiary recovery method 
terminated. In July 1992, C begins drilling injection wells as part of a 
project to apply the steam drive tertiary recovery method with respect 
to the same project area affected by the cyclic steam method. C begins 
steam injections in September 1992. Because C commences an enhanced oil 
recovery project more than 36 months after the previous tertiary 
recovery method was terminated, the project is treated as a separate 
project for which the first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter 
occurs after December 31, 1990.
    Example 3. Change in tertiary recovery method affecting 
substantially unaffected reservoir volume. In 1984, D, the owner of an 
operating mineral interest in a property, implemented a tertiary 
recovery project using cyclic steam as a method for the recovery of 
crude oil. The project was certified as a tertiary recovery project for 
purposes of the windfall profit tax. D continued the cyclic steam 
injection until 1992, when the tertiary recovery method was changed from 
cyclic steam injection to steam drive. The steam drive affects reservoir 
volume that was substantially unaffected by the cyclic steam injection. 
Because the steam drive affects reservoir volume that was substantially 
unaffected by the cyclic steam injection, the steam drive is treated as 
a separate project

[[Page 185]]

for which the first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter occurs 
after December 31, 1990.
    Example 4. Change in tertiary recovery method not affecting 
substantially unaffected reservoir volume. In 1988, E, the owner of an 
operating mineral interest in a property, undertook an immiscible 
nitrogen enhanced oil recovery project that resulted in more than an 
insignificant increase in the ultimate recovery of crude oil from the 
property. E continued the immiscible nitrogen project until 1992, when 
the project was converted from immiscible nitrogen displacement to 
miscible nitrogen displacement by increasing the injection of nitrogen 
to increase reservoir pressure. The miscible nitrogen displacement 
affects the same reservoir volume that was affected by the immiscible 
nitrogen displacement. Because the miscible nitrogen displacement does 
not affect reservoir volume that was substantially unaffected by the 
immiscible nitrogen displacement nor was the immiscible nitrogen 
displacement project terminated for more than 36 months before the 
miscible nitrogen displacement project was implemented, E must obtain a 
ruling whether the change from immiscible nitrogen displacement to 
miscible nitrogen displacement is treated as a separate project for 
which the first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter occurs 
after December 31, 1990. If E does not receive a ruling, the miscible 
nitrogen displacement project is not a qualified project.
    Example 5. More intensive application of a tertiary recovery method. 
In 1989, F, the owner of an operating mineral interest in a property, 
undertook an immiscible carbon dioxide displacement enhanced oil 
recovery project. F began injecting carbon dioxide into the reservoir 
under immiscible conditions. The injection of carbon dioxide under 
immiscible conditions resulted in more than an insignificant increase in 
the ultimate recovery of crude oil from the property. F continues to 
inject the same amount of carbon dioxide into the reservoir until 1992, 
when new engineering studies indicate that an increase in the amount of 
carbon dioxide injected is reasonably expected to result in a more than 
insignificant increase in the amount of crude oil that would be 
recovered from the property as a result of the previous injection of 
carbon dioxide. The increase in the amount of carbon dioxide injected 
affects the same reservoir volume that was affected by the previous 
injection of carbon dioxide. Because the additional carbon dioxide 
injected in 1992 does not affect reservoir volume that was substantially 
unaffected by the previous injection of carbon dioxide and the previous 
immiscible carbon dioxide displacement method was not terminated for 
more than 36 months before additional carbon dioxide was injected, the 
increase in the amount of carbon dioxide injected into the reservoir is 
not a significant expansion. Therefore, it is not a separate project for 
which the first injection of liquids, gases, or other matter occurs 
after December 31, 1990.

    (e) Qualified tertiary recovery methods--(1) In general. For 
purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a ``qualified tertiary 
recovery method'' is any one or any combination of the tertiary recovery 
methods described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. To account for 
advances in enhanced oil recovery technology, the Internal Revenue 
Service may by revenue ruling prescribe that a method not described in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section is a ``qualified tertiary recovery 
method.'' In addition, a taxpayer may request a private letter ruling 
that a method not described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section or in a 
revenue ruling is a qualified tertiary recovery method. Generally, the 
methods identified in revenue rulings or private letter rulings will be 
limited to those methods that involve the displacement of oil from the 
reservoir rock by means of modifying the properties of the fluids in the 
reservoir or providing the energy and drive mechanism to force the oil 
to flow to a production well. The recovery methods described in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section are not ``qualified tertiary recovery 
methods.''
    (2) Tertiary recovery methods that qualify--(i) Thermal recovery 
methods--(A) Steam drive injection. The continuous injection of steam 
into one set of wells (injection wells) or other injection source to 
effect oil displacement toward and production from a second set of wells 
(production wells);
    (B) Cyclic steam injection--The alternating injection of steam and 
production of oil with condensed steam from the same well or wells; and
    (C) In situ combustion. The combustion of oil or fuel in the 
reservoir sustained by injection of air, oxygen-enriched air, oxygen, or 
supplemental fuel supplied from the surface to displace unburned oil 
toward producing wells. This process may include the concurrent, 
alternating, or subsequent injection of water.
    (ii) Gas Flood recovery methods--(A) Miscible fluid displacement. 
The injection of gas (e.g., natural gas, enriched natural gas, a 
liquified petroleum slug

[[Page 186]]

driven by natural gas, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or flue gas) or alcohol 
into the reservoir at pressure levels such that the gas or alcohol and 
reservoir oil are miscible;
    (B) Carbon dioxide augmented waterflooding. The injection of 
carbonated water, or water and carbon dioxide, to increase waterflood 
efficiency;
    (C) Immiscible carbon dioxide displacement. The injection of carbon 
dioxide into an oil reservoir to effect oil displacement under 
conditions in which miscibility with reservoir oil is not obtained. This 
process may include the concurrent, alternating, or subsequent injection 
of water; and
    (D) Immiscible nonhydrocarbon gas displacement. The injection of 
nonhydrocarbon gas (e.g., nitrogen) into an oil reservoir, under 
conditions in which miscibility with reservoir oil is not obtained, to 
obtain a chemical or physical reaction (other than pressure) between the 
oil and the injected gas or between the oil and other reservoir fluids. 
This process may include the concurrent, alternating, or subsequent 
injection of water.
    (iii) Chemical flood recovery methods--(A) Microemulsion flooding. 
The injection of a surfactant system (e.g., a surfactant, hydrocarbon, 
cosurfactant, electrolyte, and water) to enhance the displacement of oil 
toward producing wells; and
    (B) Caustic flooding--The injection of water that has been made 
chemically basic by the addition of alkali metal hydroxides, silicates, 
or other chemicals.
    (iv) Mobility control recovery method--Polymer augmented 
waterflooding. The injection of polymeric additives with water to 
improve the areal and vertical sweep efficiency of the reservoir by 
increasing the viscosity and decreasing the mobility of the water 
injected. Polymer augmented waterflooding does not include the injection 
of polymers for the purpose of modifying the injection profile of the 
wellbore or the relative permeability of various layers of the 
reservoir, rather than modifying the water-oil mobility ratio.
    (3) Recovery methods that do not qualify. The term ``qualified 
tertiary recovery method'' does not include--
    (i) Waterflooding--The injection of water into an oil reservoir to 
displace oil from the reservoir rock and into the bore of the producing 
well;
    (ii) Cyclic gas injection--The increase or maintenance of pressure 
by injection of hydrocarbon gas into the reservoir from which it was 
originally produced;
    (iii) Horizontal drilling--The drilling of horizontal, rather than 
vertical, wells to penetrate hydrocarbon bearing formations;
    (iv) Gravity drainage--The production of oil by gravity flow from 
drainholes that are drilled from a shaft or tunnel dug within or below 
the oil bearing zones; and
    (v) Other methods--Any recovery method not specifically designated 
as a qualified tertiary recovery method in either paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section or in a revenue ruling or private letter ruling described 
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (4) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (e).

    Example 1. Polymer augmented waterflooding. In 1992 G, the owner of 
an operating mineral interest in a property, begins a waterflood project 
with respect to the property. To reduce the relative permeability in 
certain areas of the reservoir and minimize water coning, G injects 
polymers to plug thief zones and improve the areal and vertical sweep 
efficiency of the reservoir. The injection of polymers into the 
reservoir does not modify the water-oil mobility ratio. Accordingly, the 
injection of polymers into the reservoir in connection with the 
waterflood project does not constitute polymer augmented waterflooding 
and the project is not a qualified enhanced oil recovery project.
    Example 2. Polymer augmented waterflooding. In 1993 H, the owner of 
an operating mineral interest in a property, begins a caustic flooding 
project with respect to the property. Engineering studies indicate that 
the relative permeability of various layers of the reservoir may result 
in the loss of the injectant to thief zones, thereby reducing the areal 
and vertical sweep efficiency of the reservoir. As part of the caustic 
flooding project, H injects polymers to plug the thief zones and improve 
the areal and vertical sweep efficiency of the reservoir. Because the 
polymers are injected into the reservoir to improve the effectiveness of 
the caustic

[[Page 187]]

flooding project, the project is a qualified enhanced oil recovery 
project.
