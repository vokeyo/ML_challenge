			<a name="101140Jan0%2E119355327575"></a>Fast dynamics as an indicator of protein stability in glass<BR>
		
		
			Despite the widespread use of lyophilization for protein stabilization, there are no well-established rational approaches to formulation for lyophilized proteins.  As a result, many proteinaceous drug candidates with apparent potential go untested for want of sufficient stability even to perform initial trials.  Materials dynamics are universally accepted as important to protein preservation, but when considered in protein formulations, slow structural (?) relaxation is often considered exclusively in relating host dynamics with the time-course of degradation for biological materials embedded in glasses.  a relaxation is frequently used, but is often not sufficient to predict protein stability.  We have shown a striking, and apparently more reliable correlation between stability of proteins in glasses and the fast (ps – ns), local dynamics of the glass itself.  This correlation was first made with data from neutron scattering. In this presentation I will discuss a steady-state fluorescence method we are developing for estimating hydrogen-bond network lifetimes in biopreservation glasses which gives dynamics information on the same timescale as that of the neutron scattering, and also shows a strong correlation with protein preserving ability of hydrophilic glasses. This fluorescence probe has potential in optimizing glasses for protein stabilization as well as serving as a powerful tool in clarifying the role of fast dynamics in protein stabilization.<BR>

			<a name="101432Steve0%2E715761676516"></a>Effects of Compatibilizer on Immiscible Polymer Blends:  Rheology and Morphological Control by Sequence of Blending<BR>
		
		
			 Block copolymers are often added to immiscible polymer blends to improve blending.  The primary goal of this research is to quantify the effect of such compatibilizer on the rheological properties of immiscible (PIB/PDMS) polymer blends having a droplet-matrix morphology with droplet volume fractions approaching 50%.  We find that a compatibilizer has a much larger effect on the blend rheology at high droplet volume fractions.  For example, with as little as 0.5% compatibilizer, the relative viscosity of the compatibilized blends can be nearly a factor of two higher than uncompatibilized blends, and the recovery after cessation of shear nearly a factor of 1.5 times higher than uncompatibilized blends. Furthermore, the block copolymer used was able to suppress droplet coalescence only if PIB was the continuous phase. Our results are consistent with a mechanism of full or partial interfacial immobilization. 
    The coalescence suppression phenomenon allows us to generate unusual morphologies (such as double emulsions) by varying the sequence of blending.  However, high-stress mixing caused significant sub drop leakage into the matrix phase.  Similar results were obtained also using a more commercially-relevant melt blend system with reactive compatibilization: nylon6,6 and polystyrene-co-maleic anhydride.
    In summary, we find that in immiscible polymer blends, even small amounts of compatibilizer can have large rheological and morphological consequences.<BR>

			Modeling, design and control of micro-scale devices for bio-chemical and medical applications. The focus is on applications where control can dramatically improve or allow new system capabilities. We consider all aspects of the design pathway from initial application choice, to system modeling, device fabrication, phrasing of design tasks as tractable mathematical problems, control algorithm development and experimental demonstration and validation. Projects include steering of cells by micro flow control, precision control of electrowetting flows, modeling and control of bio-compatible conducting plastic micro-actuators, monitoring cells on chip and magnetically targeted deep-tissue drug delivery.

				SURF SUMMER SEMINAR SERIES: 
			
		
		
			<a name="032831Anita0%2E656975997146"></a>The Science of Trace Explosive Detection<BR>
		
		
			In collaboration  with the Transportation Security Administration’s Trace Explosive Detection Group, the NIST Surface and Microanalysis Science Division has  been working to build a chemical metrology program to support the widespread operational deployment and effective utilization of  trace explosives detection devices throughout the United States.  A second objective of this program is to develop at NIST the specialized measurement expertise that will be needed to support the next generation of explosive detection equipment. The low volatility of most high explosives makes direct analysis of vapors impractical. Therefore, most detection systems are based on either airborne or surface swipe collection of micrometer-sized explosive particles with subsequent thermal vaporization of the particles into an ion mobility spectrometer for identification. The effective collection and thermal desorption of the explosive particles is  the  critical front-end process for the successful and reproducible detection of explosives.  Using funding from the NIST Office of Law Enforcement Standards and the Department of Homeland Security, we are leveraging existing expertise in particle analysis, analytical chemistry and chemical microscopy to study the explosives collection and detection process in detail. This information is  being used to help facilitate the continued development, characterization, calibration and standardization of both tabletop and portal trace explosive detection devices. This presentation will include a discussion of our ongoing research in this area with an emphasis on some of the advance metrology tools being used to characterize individual explosive particles. Finally, some of our recent efforts in preparation of standards for trace explosive detection will be discussed including the use of drop-on-demand ink jet printing of explosives.<BR>

			<a name="095058Rober0%2E0376643829166"></a>Rough Surface Adhesion in Dry and Wet Environments<BR>
		
		
		Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are currently used in industrial applications such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, and digital micromirror devices as a result of inherent performance enhancements and manufacturing cost reductions.  One of the major hurdles preventing a larger number of MEMS-based products from entering the mainstream is unwanted adhesion, commonly called stiction, which prevents relative motion between structures.  MEMS are particularly vulnerable to adhesion as a result of the large surface-to-volume ratio, small surface separations, and highly compliant components.  The purpose of this work is to understand the role of the various interfacial forces via microcantilever experiments as a function of surface roughness and relative humidity (RH) and independent calculations using the measured surface topography.

In dry ambients, van der Waals dispersion forces are the dominant adhesion mechanism.  While the average surface separation Dave is governed by the contacting (highest) summits, the adhesion is mainly due to van der Waals dispersion forces acting across extensive non-contacting areas and is related to 1/Dave2.  In wet ambients, capillary condensation of water has a significant effect on rough surface adhesion.  Above a threshold RH, which is a function of the surface roughness, the adhesion jumps due to meniscus formation at the interface and increases rapidly towards the upper limit of ?=2?cos?=144 mJ/m2, where ? is the liquid surface energy and ? is the contact angle.  A detailed model based on the measured surface topography qualitatively agrees with the experimental data only when the topographic correlations between the upper and lower surfaces are considered.

In addition to van der Waals and capillary attractions, particulates can also strongly influence the interfacial adhesion between rough surfaces by changing their average separation.  Above a threshold density, the particles introduce a topography that is more significant than the intrinsic surface roughness.  As a result, the interfacial separation is governed by the particle size and the adhesion is lower but stochastic in nature.  Based on the composition and mechanical properties, we determined that the particles on our micromachined surfaces are silicon carbide (SiC).  High temperature annealing in the fabrication process allows residual carbon in the sacrificial oxide layer to migrate to the polysilicon surface and form the SiC particles.

			<a name="105608Neil0%2E926851113963"></a>A Cooper-Pair Box as a Quantum Bit<BR>
		
		
		In this talk, I will present some of our experimental studies on a Cooper-pair box (i.e. a superconducting charge qubit); a qubit is the basic element of a quantum computer. A Cooper-pair box (CPB) consists of a small superconducting island separated from superconducting leads by a tunnel junction or Josephson junction. The quantum states of the system correspond to a discrete number of excess Cooper pairs or to a superposition of such states. I will discuss our measurements of the lifetime of the first excited state; T1 is found to vary from less than 50 ns up to approximately 10 microseconds. These results are consistent with voltage or charge noise coupled to the island of the CPB. Sources of noise in our system will be discussed. Finally, I will present some recent measurements where we observe an avoided level splitting in the excited state spectrum due to the coupling of the CPB to a two-level system, which can be modeled by incorporating a charge two-level fluctuator in the Hamiltonian for our system.

			<b>2007 U.S. WORLD STANDARDS DAY PAPER COMPETITION</b><BR>
		
	
	
		The U.S. standards community will celebrate World Standards Day on Thursday, October 18, 2007, at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC.    This year’s theme, “Standards and the Global Village” recognizes the global consensus-building capacity of standards developing organizations.  Along with this event, the 2007 World Standards Day Sponsors, including NIST, will hold the annual paper competition.  Papers are invited that show, using specific examples, ways that standards developing organizations have encouraged and created global consensus for the economic and social benefit of the global village. Paper competition winners will be announced and given their awards at the U.S. celebration of World Standards Day. Cash prizes are awarded by the Standards Engineering Society (SES) and the World Standards Day Planning Committee. The first place winner will receive a plaque and $2,500. Second and third place winners will receive $1,000 and $500, respectively, along with a certificate. In addition, the winning papers will be published in SES’s journal, Standards Engineering.  ELIGIBILITY: The competition is open to all U.S. individuals in the private sector or at government facilities. Papers may be co-authored. RULES: Entries must be original and not previously published. NIST papers must be processed through WERB or BERB. All paper contest submissions must be received with an official entry form by midnight August 31, 2007, by the SES Executive Director, 13340 SW 96th Avenue, Miami, Florida, 33176.  Complete details and entry forms are available on the SES website www.ses-standards.org  (follow the link for “2007 WSD Paper Competition.”)  For additional information about the U.S. Celebration of World Standards Day, or to register for the event, please visit www.wsd-us.org.<BR>
