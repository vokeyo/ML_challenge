<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>5. Present Occupation Patterns and Land-Use
Problems of Guam</B></FONT></P>

<P>In the past 10 years, Guam has undergone Japanese occupation for
2-1/2 years (in connection with which there are several interesting
stories or important items &#151; a few of which are mentioned under
specific localities and monuments below); U. S. Army Air Force strikes,
and devastating naval bombardment in July 1944 almost entirely
destroying Agana; assault and recapture by the 3rd Amphibious Corps,
made up largely of the U. S. Marines, led by Major General R. S. Geiger,
U.S.M.C., July 21-August 10, 1944 (landing beaches, etc., connected with
the liberation of Guam, are mentioned below under specific localities
and markers), with mopping up yet to be completed in fiscal year 1952, a
few Japanese soldiers being still at large on the island in addition to
the five who surrendered in the fall of 1951; bulldozing and other
cleanup activities by the Navy, completing the razing of Agana,
including the remnants of the Guam Museum; construction of several
extensive military installations, including large airfields as well as
quarters for personnel; a severe typhoon in 1949; and finally planning
and, to an extent, reconstruction.</P>

<P>The rest of the Marianas Islands are included with the Carolines and
Marshalls in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, administered by
the United States, through the Office of the High Commissioner, as a
mandate from the United Nations under a Trusteeship Agreement of 1947
and under Executive order 9875, pursuant thereto, signed by the
President on July 18, 1947. Interim administration by the U. S. Navy was
replaced by civil government in 1951.</P>

<P>Guam remained under Navy control until July 1, 1950, when the civil
government of the island was transferred to civil administration by an
Organic Act, Guamanians becoming United States citizens under the same
act. The relationship of the Territorial government with the Federal
government is handled through the division of Territories, Department of
the Interior.</P>

<P>The island of Guam is still dominated, however, largely owned or
controlled, by the military &#151; the Navy and the Air Force, all
remaining Army ground forces having been recently withdrawn &#151; and
is occupied in considerable part by active military installations, new
developments under construction, and extensive abandoned military
installations (disused airstrips, Quonset huts and other temporary
structures, and concrete barracks, etc.). The two large abandoned
airfields in the north half could undoubtedly be rehabilitated and
readied for use without excessive difficulty, and these must, I suppose,
be considered as only temporarily abandoned as of the present. The
installations (4 camps) on the east coast of the south half are
apparently permanently abandoned and are going to pieces rapidly.</P>

<P>Actual ownership of land is as follows, according to the latest
available figures (as of about February 1, 1952, as given to the Guam
Congress in a speech by Manuel F. Leon Guerrero, formerly Acting
Director of Land Management in the Government of Guam; the figures in
parentheses are those as of August 1, 1950, then civil administration
replaced naval government on Guam, taken from the mimeographed report by
Robert K. Coote, "Land-use conditions and land problems on Guam"):</P>

<P>In addition, the military has around 5,000 acres under leasehold from
private owners. Transfer of the entire public domain from direct
Interior Department control and Federal ownership to the Government of
Guam has been proposed, is currently being worked out, and would seem
the logical thing, as pointed out by Mr. Coote in his August 1950
report.* The Federal public domain consists largely of:</P>

<P><HR>*Since this report was drafted, the recommended action has been
taken by the Secretary of the Interior, according to a news dispatch
noted in the Honolulu papers in early March 1952.<HR></P>

<P>(1) interior of the northern half of the island, not at present
extensively used for military or other purposes, unpopulated, and
probably relatively unusable except perhaps as a Territorial Forest
Reserve,** to be gradually reforested for eventual controlled and
properly managed timber production (there are no historic or
archeological sites known or reported in this area of no running water,
and probably no recreational potentialities of importance); (2) much of
the northeast coast, from then northeast corner (actually from Tagua
Point, at the east end of Tarague Beach, about 2 miles west of Pati
Point) to Sassayan or Campanaya Point, on the coast directly east of Mt.
Barrigada &#151; an area of interesting scenery and ecology, containing
a number of important archeological sites; an area largely undeveloped
and not at present easy of access, without good beaches, so far as
known, and not well suited, at least in large part, for agriculture of
any kind; now occupied apparently only by a few of the Japanese
stragglers; probably it should be retained in public ownership for the
most part, without specific designation as a whole &#151; simply as
Government of Guam public domain, from which archeological reserves and
biological reserves (a study by a botanist or ecologist probably should
be made) can be withdrawn, other portions of which could perhaps be
opened to private ownership through sale or exchange; (3) small
scattered tracts, of no special importance so far as I know, in the
central portion of the island; (4) an extensive area of the hill country
in the southwest and south, extending from Santa Rita around to the
vicinity of Inarajan, more or less surrounding (except on the north) the
Fena-Talafofo River drainage &#151; very possibly the Government of Guam
could, while retaining title to most of this area, lease it at low rates
for grazing (or, in valleys, farming), and thus be able to regulate
operations according to the capacity and condition of the land; again,
known archeological sites or other small areas of special interest could
be withdrawn from entry as their exact locations and boundaries are
determined by engineering surveys.</P>

<P><HR>**The recent Public Lands Act (P.L. 33, August 29, 1951) empowers
the Director of the Department of Land Management to set aside and
operate forest reservations (Art. 4, Sec. 25) and soil erosion and water
conservation lands (Art. 4, Sec.26), and to recommend the creation of
historical, scientific, or scenic parks (Art. 5, Sec. 29), as well as to
lease or sell government lands in specified ways (Article 6) and to
issue grazing permits (Article 7) and homesteading permits and
conveyances (Article 8).<HR></P>

<P>The northern plateau of the island is dominated by the Air Force,
which owns virtually all the lands between the highway loop encircling
the public domain there and the cliffs or beaches; the beaches are
largely privately owned (but leased by the Air Force, such as beautiful
Tarague). There is, I suppose, no likelihood of imminent Air Force
release even of the abandoned installations and unutilized areas, but
the good beaches ought to be acquired by the Government of Guam if at
all possible, for recreational potentialities as well as for protection
of archeological remains (and one historic building, the "Casa Real," on
private property below Ritidian point), even with military use
continuing.</P>

<P>In the south, various naval commands occupy much of the western
portion, around Apra Harbor and in the upper drainage of the Fena
(Talafofo) River, from the vicinity of Agana to just below &#151; (just
east and north of) the highest mountain peaks. It is not likely that the
Navy will withdraw from any sizable part of this entire more or less
continuous area, which is mostly occupied by active military
installations. At present (February 1952) the Navy is planning to
release surplus lands not in use, but surely these will be the small
scattered tracts of abandoned installations in the southeast and
elsewhere.</P>

<P>The central waist of the island and the southeast are privately
owned, with only occasional tracts of government (public domain or
military) land. The southwest coast, south of Apra Harbor (and west of
the Fena River watershed and the adjoining public domain south from
Santa Rita), is also largely privately owned from Agat south. Most of
the Guamanian population is concentrated in these areas, mainly near and
inland from Agana; and here most of the agriculture is still carried on.
The privately-owned beaches about the northwestern and northern end are
unoccupied; clear evidences of old farms (coconut plantations, etc.) and
house-sites may be occasionally seen. The one tract of private property
within the public domain along the east coast in the north is utilized
but not regularly inhabited (the area served as a refuge for a group of
Guamanians who supported themselves there during the 2-1/2-year Japanese
occupation). The entire northern plateau, in fact, is virtually
unpopulated north of Dededo except by the Air Force; there is only one
straggling little village &#151; Yigo &#151; with an even smaller
concentration close by at Santa Rosa, with a number of farms in this
vicinity and atop Mt. Santa Rosa. There seem to be only a few other
small scattered farms, in the Hilaan vicinity. There is only one
seasonally- or temporarily-occupied house on the northern beaches, Juan
Castro's place near Ritidian Point. Settlement is almost continuous in
the western part of the mid-section of the island, from Asan and Agana
(the capital, which was completely destroyed in 1944), and Tumoning
through Sinajana and smaller villages to Barrigada and vicinity. On the
east, however, the Pago Bay area is unoccupied: the former village of
Pago was moved (by the Japanese, I believe) to Sumay, on Orote
Peninsula, whence the people were again cleared out, to establish Santa
Rita, I understand. Around the southern coast is a series of small towns
comparatively undisturbed by the war and the post-war period; from
northeast to Southwest these are Yona, Talafofo, Inarajan, Merizo,
Umatac. Farms and houses are scattered between these to some degree, and
extend inland from them up the valleys; much of the interior, however,
is not occupied permanently.</P>

<P>The total population (including the military) of Guam in 1950 was
58,754, including about 28,600 Guamanians. Of the total, 20,700 were
concentrated in the municipalities of Sinajana and Barrigada, the former
including the Agana vicinity. About half of the total is made up by
United States military personnel, who would be largely in the
municipalities (districts) of Yigo, Dededo, Asan, Piti, Sumay, and
Agat.</P>

<P>Agriculture is generally small-scale and practically on a family
subsistence basis. Farm products are not exported or even marketed
locally to any extent. Livestock raising is not well developed at all,
and grazing lands are in generally poor condition. Livestock, poultry,
fruit trees, and farming equipment were extensively lost in the war and
in the 1949 typhoon. The forests have been removed and destroyed pretty
completely. Fishing is almost entirely neglected, surprisingly. In fine,
the natural resources of Guam have been seriously depleted and yet are
not being fully exploited at present or systematically rebuilt.</P>

<P>A considerable percentage of Guamanian citizens are working, directly
or indirectly, for the military (even so, the Navy or their contractors
have found it advisable to import several thousand Filipino laborers). A
very high percentage, probably the majority of Guamanians, have changed
over completely from a self-supporting basis or subsistence economy to a
dollar economy, dependence on cash received by sale of goods or services
to, primarily, the military. Actually, the trend to a cash economy,
instead of a subsistence basis, began early in the American period,
between 1900 and 1911. The traditional attitude toward land ownership
and alienation has persisted, however, and Guamanians do not generally
sell their lands readily. Toward cash money and other possessions,
except land, many or most Guamanians have an understandably careless
attitude, after undergoing typhoons, earthquakes, the Japanese
occupation, the American reconquest, and finally the less abrupt but
heavy impact of post-war military activities and planned
reconstruction.</P>

<P>Many complex problems, even further beyond the scope of this report
than are topics already discussed, are created by these factors and
various others. An important opportunity is offered for a historical and
practical study by a social anthropologist interested in culture-change
and applied anthropology, to compare and trace developments through (1)
the aboriginal culture, as reconstructed from early historical sources
and archeological materials, partly done by Laura Thompson in <U>The
Native Culture of the Marianas Islands</U>, B. P. Bishop Museum Bulletin
185, 1945; (2) the modified culture of 1700-1870, from travelers'
descriptions and sources such as the memoirs of Governor de la Corte;
(3) the people of Guamin the early twentieth century, drawing mainly on
Safford, 1906; (4) the situation just before World War II, as discussed
in the original 1941 edition of Mrs. Thompson's book <U>Guam and Its
People</U>, and other sources; and (5) post-war and present-day Guam and
its problems. Studies are needed for Guam such as the paper by Alexander
Spoehr, "The Tinian Chamorros," <U>Human Organization</U> 10:16-20, No.
4, Winter 1951, and the book by Alice Joseph and V. Murray, <U>Chamorros
and Carolinians of Saipan</U>, 1951.</P>
