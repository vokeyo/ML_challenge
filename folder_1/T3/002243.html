<STRONG>PRESIDENT CLINTON APPOINTS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ADVISORS </STRONG>


<P>
     Washington -- President Clinton today announced the
membership of a private-sector committee to advise him on major
science and technology issues and to help guide federal
investments in science and technology toward national goals.  The
18-member President's Committee of Advisors on Science and
Technology (PCAST) is composed of top-level representatives from
industry, education and research institutions, and
nongovernmental organizations.
 
<P>
     "I am very pleased to name these eminent scientists,
engineers, business leaders, and educators as some of my key
advisors," the President said.  "Drawn from a cross-section of
America, they will help ensure that our science and technology
policies reflect our nation's needs:   health; prosperity based
on long-term economic growth and technological investment;
national security; environmental responsibility; and improved
quality of life. 

<P>
     The appointment of private-sector advisors to the President
highlights the Administration's goal of fostering public/private
partnerships to achieve national science and education goals. 
"To achieve our goals,  we must strengthen partnerships with
industry, with state and local governments, and with schools,
colleges and universities across the country," said President
Clinton.  "My goal for this committee is to help encourage those
partnerships."  

<P>
     President Clinton established the PCAST by Executive Order
in November 1993.  Its members have established track records of
significant achievement and represent the diverse perspectives
and expertise in the U.S. science and technology establishment. 
The committee is co-Chaired by John H. Gibbons, Assistant to the
President for Science and Technology, and by John A. Young,
former President and CEO of the Hewlett-Packard Company.

<P>
     The PCAST will advise the President both directly and
through the Assistant to the President for Science and
Technology.  The committee will also serve as a formal channel
for private sector advice to the National Science and Technology
Council.  The NSTC is a cabinet-level council, chaired by the
President, that coordinates science and technology policies and
programs across federal agencies.   The PCAST will ensure the
private sector perspective is included in that policy-making
process.
