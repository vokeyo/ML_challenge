</font>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Welcome to this afternoon's hearing on child support and
fatherhood proposals.</p>
<p>Our hearing today will provide oversight on the child support program as
well as allow us to explore further changes such as those in legislation
introduced by our colleagues, Nancy Johnson and Ben Cardin.</p>
<p>Substantial reforms of the child support enforcement program were enacted
in the 1996 welfare reform law. For example, we have seen the creation of a
new hire database, improved paternity establishment, use of financial
institution data matches, and revocation of driver's licenses and other
privileges for parents delinquent in paying child support.</p>
<p>This Subcommittee has and will continue to monitor the effects of such
changes. Here is what we know already. In 2000, $17.9 billion in child support
was collected, which is a 50-percent increase since 1996. By using the
passport denial program, $7 million in lump-sum payments were collected in the
last year, and the number of paternities established in 2000 reached a record
1.6 million, an increase of 46 percent since 1996. Overall, the system seems
to be operating more efficiently with total collections per program dollars
spent on the rise as well.</p>
<p>Yet, with all that, we also know that in 1999, the program collected child
support payments for only 37 percent of its caseload. So this leads to a
number of questions: which of the recent changes have been most effective,
which need further refinement, and what else can be done to improve child
support collections?</p>
<p>The options for further improvements include the second topic of our
hearing today, fatherhood proposals. Single-parent families benefit in many
ways from the contributions of a non-custodial parent, most often a father.
Unfortunately, many fathers are poor, and as a group, unmarried poor fathers
face greater challenges than other dads such as elevated rates of unemployment
and incarceration. Some were themselves raised by single moms, often without
the benefit of a positive male role model.</p>
<p>The fatherhood initiatives we will hear about today are designed to help
break this cycle, to help fathers meet their responsibilities as parents,
providers, and hopefully husbands. That should improve child support
collection, but this effort is about much more than just that.</p>
<p>For too long, government seemed to care only about the provider side of
this role, which is important to be sure. But children need more than just
financial support to grow into healthy, productive members of society. Every
child deserves a father for all the roles a dad plays in a child's
development--parent, mentor, disciplinarian, coach, and friend.</p>
<p>In addition to helping fathers and children improve their emotional and
financial connections, fatherhood programs also can help both fathers and
mothers better understand the positive aspects of marriage.</p>
<p>For example, a recent study indicates that teenagers living with their
married biological parents have lower levels of emotional and behavioral
problems, higher levels of school involvement, and fewer school suspensions or
expulsions than teens living in step-families, with single mothers, or in
cohabiting families.</p>
<p>I am encouraged that many fatherhood programs let young people know about
the benefits of marriage, especially for their children. The House is on
record supporting such efforts, and the President has proposed additional
funding. So support seems to be growing, at least in part, because, as we will
hear, the need for fatherhood programs is great.</p>
<p>To discuss these topics and more, we have a distinguished group of
witnesses with us today. We will start by hearing from Members of Congress
about proposals they have introduced. Then we will hear from the States,
advocates and researchers, about what is working and what more should be done.</p>
<p>Finally, I note that Ron Haskins is joining us as a witness today for the
first time since his departure as this Subcommittee's staff director last
year. We welcome him back and thank him for his many years of service to this
Committee and the Congress.</p>
<p>Without objection, each member will have the opportunity to submit a
written statement and have it included in the record, and at this point, Mr.
Cardin, would you like to make an opening statement?</p>
<p>[The opening statement of <a href="6-28herg.htm">Chairman Herger</a>
follows:]</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am glad you pointed out that Ron
Haskins is here so I have the opportunity to cross-examine him when he gets up
here. I have been looking forward to that for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, let me thank you for holding this hearing. We need to look at
our child support collections system, and we need to reform it. We can work in
a very bipartisan way in order to try to improve the quality of life for
families to depend upon the collection of child support.</p>
<p>I particularly want to acknowledge our colleagues that are here. Mrs.
Johnson, the distinguished Chair of this Committee in the last Congress,
forged a very strong coalition among Democrats and Republicans to reform our
child support system. It wasn't her first actions last year, and when we were
able to pass a bill very similar to the one that we are considering today by a
vote of 405 to 18 on the floor of the House, but for over the years that she
has been working on the child support issues.</p>
<p>It was my pleasure last year to join her in that legislation, and again
this year to join her in the legislation that reforms our child support system
so that more money, in fact, can go to the families and that we can make it
simpler for our local governments to administer our child support system.</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge Mike Castle, who has come up with a very
important tool to help families collect child support, and I applaud Mike's
actions on this issue.</p>
<p>Chris Cox has come up with a proposal to help use our Tax Code in a more
effective way to help families collect child support. So I appreciate all
three of our colleagues being here today to assist us as we develop
legislation to reform our child support collections system.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, child support should go to the children. I guess that is why
we call it &quot;child support,&quot; but, today, the arrearages in many cases
go to government, not to the families. Our laws require that the governments
be paid back first. If a State wants to pass through more child support to the
families, the Federal laws penalize those States by requiring the State to pay
the Federal share which can be anywhere between one-half to three-quarters of
the total amount that is passed through to the family.</p>
<p>We just recently had a debate on the floor of this Congress about what
marginal tax rates should be, and I heard many of my colleagues talk about
in-the-30's percent being too high of a marginal tax rate. Well, we have
100-percent tax rate on child support collections today, 100-percent rate for
the poorest people in our country, and that makes absolutely no sense at all.</p>
<p>That is why we need to enact legislation that Mrs. Johnson and I have been
working on that would allow States to pass through child support to the
families first. Many of these families are not on welfare today. To encourage
work, we should be doing this, without having to pay the Federal share as long
as the State disregards the money for the purposes of determining eligibility.</p>
<p>I think that makes a lot of sense. I think we need to move forward on that
legislation. Let me just give you a few reasons more. First, it will provide
resources to families that need it. The Congressional Budget Office has
estimated this will be about $6.3 billion over the next 10 years going to
these families. That is a significant amount of resources going to low-income
families.</p>
<p>Second, it is incentive for the non-custodial parent to pay child support.
If it goes to the families, it is much more likely that the non-custodial
parent will, in fact, pay child support.</p>
<p>Third, it helps the family unit to work together. The non-custodial parent
feels that he is part or she is part of the family, which is not the case
today in many cases.</p>
<p>Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, it certainly simplifies the administration
of the child support systems in this country.</p>
<p>So, for all of these reasons, I hope that this Committee and this House
will do what we did last year and pass this legislation and hopefully convince
the other body to do the same.</p>
<p>Lastly, let me point out that the fatherhood provisions that were worked on
and passed at least twice by the House in the last Congress were carefully
worked on by Mrs. Johnson and I and a group of people in a very bipartisan
way, which sets up a way that we can really work to help the non-custodial
parent, by developing some national models and some local efforts to improve
efforts to help the non-custodial parent be part of the family and a
constructive provider of support.</p>
<p>So I would hope that the Committee would look kindly on this legislation,
and I do look forward to hearing from all the witnesses today.</p>
<p>[The opening statement of <a href="6-28card.htm">Mr. Cardin</a> follows:]</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you, Mr. Cardin.</p>
<p>Before we move on to our testimony this afternoon, I want to remind the
witnesses to limit their oral statements to 5 minutes. However, without
objection, all of the written testimony will be made a part of the permanent
record.</p>
<p>For the first panel today, we are honored to have several of our House
colleagues. I would like to welcome the Honorable Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, a member of this Subcommittee, the Honorable Christopher Cox from
my home State of California, and the Honorable Mike Castle of Delaware. Again,
I welcome each of you here.</p>
<p>With that, we will begin with your testimony, Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<b>
<p><a name="njohnson"></a>STATEMENT OF THE HON. NANCY L. JOHNSON, A
REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT</p>
</b>
<p>Mrs. JOHNSON OF CONNECTICUT. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>As you and Mr. Cardin both know, I am intensely interested in the work you
are doing and commend you on moving forward on the important issues that face
our children and families in America.</p>
<p>Let me be brief because I know you both know a good deal about the bill
that I am going to talk about and, in larger measure, the subjects I am going
to talk about.</p>
<p>First of all, I am pleased that Mr. Cardin and I did pass legislation in
the last session that had overwhelming support and was a real advance in the
concept of the child support law. We did pass very tough enforcement a few
years ago, and we are collecting a lot more child support than we ever have,
but it is not going directly to the woman. It is not going directly to the
mother of the child. It is not going directly into the family's resources. So,
as we move forward with welfare reform, we need to have this money flow to the
mother of the child in order to create the bond between the mother of the
child and the father of the child that will allow the development of the human
relations, the emotional ties that are essential to the well-being of that
child.</p>
<p>So our bill does say that when they leave welfare, the money goes directly
to them, but, more importantly--and it was more controversial--it says that
the money can flow to the mother while she is still on welfare. This is
extremely important.</p>
<p>When that young man is making child support payments, he needs to feel he
is contributing to his family, and the mother of the child needs to feel that
contribution. Unless it comes directly--and with today's technology, we can
easily account for that in our system. Instead of having it flow to the State
and from the State to the mother, which it does now, it must flow directly
because then the mother gets it; that the father is there and is a part of
this child's life and a part of the economic security of this child. It is one
of the most compelling facts in the whole hemisphere of facts associated with
all of these issues is the fact that when a child is born out of wedlock, 80
percent of the women and men believe the relationship that produced the child
was a serious and important one and, furthermore, was going to last into the
future. In 2 years, the fathers are gone. So we need to look seriously at our
responsibility to make sure the fathers are not gone, and part of that is to
enforce the child support laws, but to make sure that the flow of those
dollars into the family give that male standing in that family as the father
of that child.</p>
<p>If you combine the child support changes that we are proposing in our
legislation with the fatherhood provisions--and these, at this point, only
apply to the fathers of children on welfare or who have been on welfare within
the last year--the goal is to give the men the same support we are giving the
women, so that not only can they grow economically in parallel, but so that
they can grow emotionally in parallel.</p>
<p>One of the reasons the men are gone in 2 years is because during that time,
the woman has had job service, some career counseling. She has gone through a
process which helps her see what her capabilities are. She often has started
her first job, and she has begun to see herself as a mother and as an earner
and as a competent adult.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her male friend down here is still on the streets, unemployed,
or with a very low level or very sporadic pattern of employment. So, if he has
the same experiences, if he is helped into the same legitimate structure of
work and reward, then they experience the same things. They both grow in their
understanding of their own power as economic providers, and they have the
chance to both participate in the kind of parenting programs and money
management programs that we know will fill gaps in their educational
experience, so that they can be competent adults.</p>
<p>I just want to point to one thing that Ben Cardin did mention because it is
absolutely critical. We took a lot of flack on this last year from some
groups, but if we do not do something to help these young men with the problem
of arrearages, then we will not get them into the workforce that pays Social
Security and on retirement is eligible for benefits and Medicare.</p>
<p>Right now, because we cannot deal with the problem of arrearages, because
they have all that debt, they stay out of the legal employment system. They do
not contribute to Social Security. They will not be eligible for Medicare,
and, furthermore, there is a limit to how much they can earn and help with
their family. So that is one of the reasons they are gone.</p>
<p>We have to help them earn off those arrearages, and we can give them, for
instance, credit for in-kind services and things like that.</p>
<p>We did not define what you ought to do because we need to see what States
think up that they want to do, but we have got to face squarely the
underground economy we force these young men into, not just for a year or two,
but for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>So I thank you for your consideration of the child support issues and of
the fatherhood issues, and I look forward to working with you and thank you
very much.</p>
<p>[The prepared statement of <a href="6-28john.htm">Mrs. Johnson</a>
follows:]</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you, Mrs. Johnson, again, for all the work that you
have put into this and your leadership.</p>
<p>Now we will hear from Mr. Cox for testimony.</p>
<p><b><a name="cox"></a>STATEMENT OF THE HON. CHRISTOPHER COX, A
REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA</p>
</b>
<p>Mr. COX. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Cardin, and Chairwoman
Johnson as well for all of your leadership on these issues.</p>
<p>I am trying to speak loudly enough so I do not need a microphone, but I
think it would be helpful for the record if I use it.</p>
<p>I wanted to thank the Chairman, Mr. Cardin, and Chairwoman Johnson for all
of your leadership on these issues this year and in years prior.</p>
<p>I am here to speak about the Child Support Enforcement Act. As we are
considering ways to improve the well-being of kids who are often short-changed
because fathers are absent and because child support payments are not made, we
have to come face to face with some statistics. A staggering 93 percent of
child support is in arrears. It is the norm for child support not to be paid
or not to be paid on time, and oftentimes, as with other receivables, the
older the obligation gets, the longer it is not paid, the more likely it is it
will never be paid at all. Mountains of past-due child support will simply
never be paid at all.</p>
<p>What then happens to the custodial parent, often the mother, sometimes the
father? What happens to the kids when a family court says you are entitled to
a substantial amount or at least an adequate amount to pay for clothes, for
medical care, for food for these children, for their education in some cases,
when they get nothing, when they get absolutely nothing?</p>
<p>Some years ago, Senator Dale Bumpers had an idea, and I found it to be an
especially attractive idea and adopted it myself and it is the basis for this
legislation. It is that in the same way that the Tax Code gives a measure of
relief to someone who is owed a debt, but finds that it goes bad, we could
give tax relief to custodial parents and to those kids of the child support is
owed them, but is not paid. They could, in essence, get a bad-debt deduction.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Tax Code, in a mirror-image provision, provides for
the recognition of income for the cancellation of indebtedness. So, in this
case, the parent owes child support, but does not pay it, who is in the
position of essentially canceling his or her own debt, would recognize
cancellation of indebtedness income.</p>
<p>Because of the mirror-image tax treatment, there is no negative revenue
effect. Moreover, because statistically the custodial parents are in lower tax
brackets on average, there is a modest positive revenue effect from this
legislation.</p>
<p>There are questions that one can anticipate with a proposal such as this.
They have, in fact, been raised by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by
staff of this Committee in past years. I have been working on this for a
number of years now, and, in particular, the hearing that Chairwoman Johnson
conducted last year was an opportunity to remedy some of these technical
issues.</p>
<p>Specifically, in the bill that is now before you, both the recognition of
income and the bad debt deduction take place in exactly the same 12-month
accounting period, and so there is no problem of a mismatch of revenue and
expense from the standpoint of the Treasury.</p>
<p>Second, there are no obligations imposed upon the IRS in connection with
this legislation. It is self-reporting, using Form 1099C, a form that already
exists for the cancellation of indebtedness. It is, therefore, a simple
administrative proposal, but it might well be a powerful relief for parents
who do not have the child support that family court judges tell them they
ought to have.</p>
<p>The problems that we are talking about here today are serious ones indeed.
I wish they did not affect so many people in our country, but they do, and I
think that anything we can do to help, we ought to do. This is certainly
something that is within our power to do, and I urge your consideration and
appreciate very much the interest that you have shown already and in the past.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>[The prepared statement of <a href="6-28cox.htm">Mr. Cox</a> follows:]</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you very much, Mr. Cox, for your testimony and
appearing before our Committee. Now we are delighted to hear from Mr. Castle
of Delaware. Mr. Castle?</p>
<b>
<p><a name="castle"></a>STATEMENT OF THE HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE, A
REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE</p>
</b>
<p>Mr. CASTLE. Thank you, Chairman Herger and Ranking Member Cardin, Mr.
Watkins, and Mr. Camp.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to be here, and I want to thank you for giving me as well
as others who are going to be testifying today the opportunity to testify on
the extremely important subject of the child support enforcement in this
country.</p>
<p>It is a fundamental principle that parents who bring a child into this
world are both responsible for providing that child's physical needs,
regardless of any conflicts in their relationship. It is rewarding for me to
join you here today to discuss how we can improve the laws of this country to
enforce that principle.</p>
<p>I want to take a few minutes to discuss the Child Support Fairness and
Federal Tax Refund Interception Act of 2001. Recently, I introduced this bill
to remove a legal barrier that is preventing the Federal Tax Refund Offset
program for more effectively ensuring that child support is paid to all those
entitled to it.</p>
<p>As you know, under current law, the Federal tax refunds to parents who owe
back child support can be intercepted and used to reduce that debt. After
garnishing wages, this program is the most effective means of recovering back
child support that accounts for approximately one-quarter of all back child
support collections.</p>
<p>However, unlike garnishing wages and many other child support enforcement
tools, eligibility for this program is restricted by the age of the child.
Eligibility for the program is limited to cases where the child is still a
minor, the parent is receiving public assistance, or the child is a disabled
adult. This fails to protect non-disabled college-aged children and their
custodial parents even if the child support deficit accrued while the child
was a minor. The unintended effect of the program is that it rewards
non-custodial parents who are successful in avoiding their child support
obligations while their children are still minors, and, believe me, many do
that. The age limit removes the threat of one of the most effective child
support enforcement tools, the Tax Refund Intercept. That is what my
legislation would correct.</p>
<p>I think we should just ask ourselves whether there is any good reason why
we should allow delinquent parents to collect Federal tax refunds to use for
their enjoyment while custodial parents struggle to recover from years of
raising their children alone on one income.</p>
<p>I hope Congress will alleviate the tremendous burden on single parents who
have to work even harder to provide for their children. Artificial barriers
such as the age limit on the Federal Tax Refund Offset program should be torn
down. A non-custodial parent should not be able to escape their child support
responsibilities by playing a waiting game until their child is 18. The
Federal Tax Refund Offset program is responsible for retrieving approximately
a quarter of all back child support collections, and the time has come to make
it a greater success by helping all children and custodial parents by removing
the age limits.</p>
<p>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I thank you, Chairman
Herger.</p>
<p>I have actually approached the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee on
this. I believe this is excellent legislation. I introduced it last year. We
were unable to get it through, but I think it is so good that if we put it on
the suspension calendar for the Tuesday that we come back and you are able to
get this done, I can see your colleagues raising you on their shoulders and
carrying you out of the chambers. That may be a bit of an exaggeration, but,
nonetheless, I think it is good legislation, and I hope it would help a lot of
people. Hopefully, we can move forward with it.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to be here.</p>
<p>[The prepared statement of <a href="6-28cast.htm">Mr. Castle</a> follows:]</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you very much, Mr. Castle. Mr. Watkins to inquire.</p>
<p>Mr. WATKINS. Let me say to the panel that I have the greatest and deepest
respect for all three of you in the different directions you are coming from,
but maybe I am raised in the old school of the situation where no one is
talking about young men accepting some responsibility.</p>
<p>If we do not tell them they have got a responsibility to fulfill their
obligations, if people just feel like there is--80 percent of them feel like
they were in some kind of serious relationship, what do we--if it is a court
order they are supposed to be fulfilling in their child support payments, what
is the responsibility they have from that court order? Is it anything at all
that they--</p>
<p>Mrs. JOHNSON OF CONNECTICUT. A lot of these--</p>
<p>Mr. WATKINS. What is their penalty if they do not abide by it? Is there any
penalty for them not abiding by the court order saying you make the payments
to that young lady? I think there should be a responsibility on that young man
to make those payments. If not, he maybe should go to jail.</p>
<p>Now, I think somewhere there has got to be a responsibility. I do not
know--I know the gentlelady from Connecticut, she knows I had a little bit of
difficulty with it last year, but where are we missing that situation?</p>
<p>I know my friend from Delaware, you have been the leader of a State and you
have probably seen it from several different angles than my colleague from
California, but I think we need to put some teeth into saying you abide by
that court order, male or female.</p>
<p>Mr. COX. Mr. Chairman, if I might.</p>
<p>I think you make an excellent point, and in the Child Support Enforcement
Act, which I have just described, if the person who owes child support fails
to pay it, then he or she is required to take the amount that he or she was
supposed to pay into income, and if that person was, let us say, in the
30-percent income tax bracket, that means that there is a 30-percent penalty
that is owed for not paying child support for a full year. That is exactly the
kind of thing you are talking about, I believe.</p>
<p>Mr. WATKINS. That is at least a step in the direction of saying you have a
responsibility because I think too many times, we have said to people you can
go out and have a fling and all these kind of things, and they think that is
serious--not out one night, but it is not. They waltz away without paying
anything, and I think they need to try to be responsible. I think we need to
at least step there first and say what do we put the teeth of responsibility
in if you--</p>
<p>Mrs. JOHNSON OF CONNECTICUT. If I may comment. I agree with you absolutely.
In the end, this is about personal responsibility. Do not bring children into
the world unless you are going to be responsible for them, but remember we
have had out there for many, many years before 1994 when we reformed welfare a
system that said it is all right to have kids out of wedlock, do not worry,
the government will support you. So we have a system out there now since
welfare reform that says to the young mother, &quot;Hey, wait a minute. Let's
look at what job you are capable of,&quot; and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But we do not set the father down, even though we require a paternity
determination. We do not set the father down and say, &quot;Okay, you have
just had the baby. This is what you are going to owe. This is how it is going
to accumulate if you do not do it. This is how you manage money. Let us help
you get into the workforce.&quot; We do not give them any of the support
services, and they are mostly unemployed or have a very poor work history. We
do not give them the job placement support services. We do not give them the
career counseling, the budget management, the parenting courses to help them
bond into this situation that they have helped create that is so important to
this child. So I want to help them take their responsibility.</p>
<p>Now, this arrearages issue should not be an issue if we help people take
their responsibility from the beginning. The arrearage issue really comes from
the fact that for years, we did not. So now you have a lot of gentlemen who
would like to be active parents of their children who have this history of
debt that they often were not even aware they were building up. They thought
the mother was on welfare. She was on welfare. They did not understand that
they were liable for all that.</p>
<p>So I am not saying forgive arrearages. I want our States to begin thinking
about as people get into the workforce and we help them--some of these guys
have $40,000 debt, $30,000 debt. They are never going to make more than $8 an
hour. You cannot repay that debt. Do you want them to be paying Social
Security and get into Medicare?</p>
<p>Mr. WATKINS. A lot of college students have a lot bigger debt than that.
Nancy, there is a lot of college students that have a lot more debt than that,
and they have the responsibility--</p>
<p>Mrs. JOHNSON OF CONNECTICUT. At least they have a college degree.</p>
<p>Mr. WATKINS. But I am willing to work with you on it very closely to see if
we have got those areas of responsibility worked out because I know that there
are differences. We are dealing with a variable here of human beings, but I
think somewhere, we have got to have that step of responsibility.</p>
<p>Mrs. JOHNSON OF CONNECTICUT. I think your point is very well taken.</p>
<p>Mr. WATKINS. And I think these others can come in place, also, but I think
we have got to make sure they understand that, just like working and raising
children.</p>
<p>Mrs. JOHNSON OF CONNECTICUT. And we did in our bill really only provide a
preference for demonstration projects that attacks this problem because we
know so little about how to solve it, for just the reasons you point to.
Thanks.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Cardin to inquire.</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>
<p>Let me associate myself with the response by Mrs. Johnson. It is clear we
could do a better job in child support collection. I think we all agree on
that, and we do not want to condone any parent not paying their obligations,
but what I think we should acknowledge are some of the positive steps that
Congresses have taken, the last past Congresses have taken, to make it easier.</p>
<p>We have the suspension of our licenses that is now a requirement. We have
the trade licenses. We have the wage lien laws. Last time I checked my State
of Maryland, people are going to jail for not paying child support. We have
criminal laws and civil contempts on this around the Nation.</p>
<p>So the point about whether we should be more stringent in the use of those
penalties really rests with our States, and I agree with Mrs. Johnson.
Sometimes you need to look at the practical circumstances in which a family is
in, and that is why I really applaud the legislation that is before this
Committee because I think it is well balanced.</p>
<p>We are trying to get the non-custodial parent engaged in the emotional part
of the family, which we think will encourage a family unit and the payment of
child support obligations, and that is part of our bill.</p>
<p>We also believe that on the arrearages that the money can go to the family.
It is much more likely that the payments will be made.</p>
<p>Right now, why wouldn't you look for a way of escaping your obligations if
the money is going to the government? If it is going to your child, it is much
more likely you are going to be more interested in making the payments real.
So I think the bill is very well balanced.</p>
<p>Mr. Castle, I just might point out that I am not sure we would carry Mr.
Herger out on his shoulders, but I think the other body would. Our problem, I
think, is with the Senate. It is not with the House on this legislation. As
you know, you might want to talk to Chairman Thomas about it, but he is always
leery about sending a tax bill over to the Senate as non-controversial as it
may be because, as you know, tax bills only can originate in the House, and
the Senate has a habit of taking a very nice non-controversial bill and making
it very controversial.</p>
<p>Mr. Cox, I just want to applaud you for the improvement in the legislation,
but I just would urge as we look at this bill that you be prepared how to
address the problem of how the IRS would reconcile a dispute between the
custodial and non-custodial parent as to how much is owed. As I understand
your bill now, the custodial parent would send a 1099 form, and if the
non-custodial parent disagreed with that, I would be curious as to how the IRS
would reconcile that dispute.</p>
<p>You do not need to answer now, but it is one of the issues that I think we
would want some attention paid.</p>
<p>Mr. COX. I will undertake to give you a more elaborate answer, but on the
face of it, because it is self-implementing, self-administrating, both parents
can file a 1099C, redesigned perhaps only slightly for the purpose, and they
are responsible for their own tax returns.</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. But if there is a difference between what the custodial parent
files and the non-custodial parent, the IRS would be in a very difficult
position to determine who is correct in that.</p>
<p>Mr. COX. Yes. In fact, one of the reasons that we have these information
returns and 1099's and so on is to know when to trigger an audit. It is some
evidence that somebody is cheating.</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you, Mr. Cardin. Mr. Camp, the gentleman from
Michigan, to inquire.</p>
<p>Mr. CAMP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congresswoman Johnson, could you tell us
a bit about the pro-marriage features of the fatherhood portion of your
legislation, please?</p>
<p>Mrs. JOHNSON OF CONNECTICUT. Yes. They are very important. In the hearing
that we had and this Subcommittee held on promoting marriage, it is very, very
important. Too many of these young people are growing up in neighborhoods
where there is no example at all of a married couple. So they do not have any
opportunity to learn what are the advantages for them and for the child of
marriage, and so we do give preference to those projects that have in them
some effort to educate people about marriage because, if we do not do this, it
is almost as egregious a policy error as it was to pay people not to work.</p>
<p>Welfare was really a terrible system because it paid people not to work,
and in life, if you do not work, you do not know who you are and you are not
part of the real world, unless you are disabled. We understand that some
people cannot work.</p>
<p>In the same way, to not educate young people about marriage when they have
no opportunity to learn from their environment is to ignore the enormous
amount of research that has been done that demonstrates that children do much
better. They do better in school. They do better emotionally. They have a
brighter future if they are part of a married unit. It is really astounding
that we have utterly ignored what is now a very significant body of research
that children need both parents, and they do, do better in marriage.</p>
<p>Mr. CAMP. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I want to thank all of you for your testimony as well, and thank the
Chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you very much, Mr. Camp.</p>
<p>I want to thank each of our witnesses for your outstanding testimony, and
with that, I would at this point like to call on our second panel to come
forward, please.</p>
<p>I would also like to insert at this point in the record the statement of
Frank Fuentes, acting deputy commissioner of the Office of Child Support
Enforcement, who is not able to be here today to testify on behalf of the
United States Department of Health and Human Services, without objection.</p>
<p>[The following was subsequently received:]</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="2">Statement of Frank Fuentes, Acting Deputy
Commissioner,<br>
Office of Child Support Enforcement Administration for Children and Families,<br>
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</font></b></p>
<font size="2">
<p>Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for
giving me the opportunity to submit testimony for the record on the Child
Support Enforcement program. I am Frank Fuentes, the Acting Commissioner of
the Office of Child Support Enforcement. The Child Support Enforcement program
is a very successful Federal/State partnership effort aimed at fostering
family responsibility and promoting self-sufficiency by encouraging that both
parents support children financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, we work in partnership with States in providing
four major services: locating non-custodial parents, establishing paternity,
establishing child support obligations, and enforcing child support orders.
Welfare reform made dramatic improvements in our ability to achieve these
goals and I would like to take this opportunity to share with you the
promising results we are witnessing. I would also like to share some of the
activities the Administration is undertaking to strengthen fatherhood since I
know this is of particular interest to the Subcommittee.</p>
<b>
<p>Child Support Enforcement Program Record</p>
</b>
<p>Through enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), unprecedented tools have been provided to
the child support enforcement program. These tools are already having a
dramatic impact in securing for many of our nation's children the emotional
and financial support that they need. In FY 2000, a record $17.9 billion in
child support was collected. This represents an increase of 50 percent since
FY 1996. We now are collecting support on behalf of almost 68 percent of the
caseload where an order has been established.</p>
<p>PRWORA provided tough child support enforcement techniques and new
automated collection methods. For example, the law expanded wage garnishment,
authorized States to suspend or revoke driver and professional licenses for
parents who are delinquent, and provided for passport denial<b> </b>for
parents who were at least $5,000 delinquent in support.</p>
<p>In addition, the law established a Federal Case Registry and National
Directory of New Hires to track delinquent parents across State lines. It also
required that employers report all new hires to State agencies for transmittal
to the national directory and to match records with financial institutions so
that States may place a lien on the accounts of delinquent parents.</p>
<p>Using the expanded Federal Parent Locator Service we were able to provide
States information on three million interstate cases, and using the Passport
Denial Program, we have collected over $7 million in lump sum child support
payments in the last year. To date, more than 4,200 financial institutions
have agreed to participate in data matching for child support and nearly
700,000 individuals delinquent in their child support have been matched with
their accounts. The value of those accounts is nearly $2.5 billion. Further,
the Federal Tax Refund and Administrative Offset programs collected about $1.4
billion in calendar year 2000.</p>
<p>The record is similar with respect to paternity establishment. The number
of paternities established or acknowledged reached a record of 1.6 million in
FY 2000. This represents an increase of 46 percent since FY 1996. Of these,
over 688,000 paternities were established through in-hospital acknowledgement
programs. An additional 867,000 paternities were established through the Child
Support Enforcement program. In addition to being the first step in collecting
child support, paternity establishment engages fathers in the lives of their
children, creating the emotional bonds and security that are crucial to their
children's health and well being.</p>
<p>PRWORA streamlined the legal process for paternity establishment, making
the process easier and faster. It also expanded the voluntary in-hospital
process for paternity establishment started in 1993 and required a State
affidavit for voluntary paternity acknowledgment. In addition, the law
mandated that States publicize the availability and encourage the use of the
voluntary paternity establishment process.</p>
<p>We are excited about the dramatic results these changes are generating and
are convinced that the future of child support enforcement will continue on
this successful path. Critical to these efforts, though, is a new and
determined focus on the fathers.</p>
<b>
<p>Strengthening Fatherhood</p>
</b>
<p>I would like to turn to the Administrations efforts to strengthen
fatherhood  what we view as a critical complement to our enforcement
efforts if we are to succeed in accomplishing our basic mission of increasing
both financial and emotional support for our nations children.</p>
<p>The Office of Child Support Enforcement has worked to strengthen the role
of fathers in families. For example, we have funded eight child support
enforcement responsible fatherhood demonstration projects that will help
bolster fathers' financial and emotional involvement with their children. Each
project is different, although they all provide a range of services to aid in
collecting child support, such as job training, access and visitation, and
social services.</p>
<p>The Office of Child Support Enforcement has provided over $1.5 million to
the National Center for Strategic Nonprofit Planning and Community Leadership
(NPCL) to work with grassroots fathers organizations to help unemployed and
underemployed fathers become responsible parents. In addition, we have
approved ten State waivers supporting the Partners for Fragile Families, a set
of projects to test ways for child support enforcement programs and community
and faith-based organizations to work together to improve the opportunities of
young, unmarried fathers to support their children both financially and
emotionally. Further, PRWORA created a $10 million access and visitation
program for States, serving more than 22,000 individuals in 1997 and an
estimated 50,000 in 1998.</p>
<p>Most recently, President Bush and Secretary Thompsons clear commitment
to promoting involved, committed and responsible fatherhood as a national
priority was emphasized in the FY 2002 budget request. One of the many goals
of the Administration's FY 2002 proposal is to provide $64 million for the
first year to support low-income families by helping low-income non-custodial
parents (mainly fathers) support their children by paying child support and
connecting or reconnecting with their children.</p>
<p>This initiative shares many of the same goals as the fatherhood legislation
supported by this Subcommittee. We commend Representatives Johnson and Cardin
and the Subcommittee for your leadership in focusing attention on responsible
fatherhood and we look forward to working with you on this critical area of
mutual commitment. As the President recently said at the Fourth National
Summit on Fatherhood, &quot;For our children, and for our nation, nothing is
more important</font> <font size="2">than the national fatherhood initiative<b>.&quot;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</b>
<p>In closing, let me say that it is only through our partnership with the
Congress and the States that we have been so successful in strengthening the
Child Support Enforcement program. The many new tools provided by the Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act are helping to improve
the lives of our nation's children. We can improve on existing efforts by
focusing more attention on strengthening our commitment to fatherhood, and we
look forward to working with you on this important legislation.</p>
<p>Thank you. I would be pleased to answer your questions for the record.</p>

<p>Chairman HERGER. On the second panel this afternoon, we will be hearing
from Mr. Nathaniel Young, Jr., director of the Virginia Division of Child
Support Enforcement, and president of the National Council of Child Support
Directors; Dr. Jeffery Johnson, president and CEO of the National Center of
Strategic Nonprofit Planning and Community Leadership (NPCL), accompanied by
Mr. Raymond Byrd; Dr. Ron Haskins, senior fellow in Governmental Studies at
The Brookings Institution and senior consultant at the Annie E. Casey
Foundation; Dr. Elaine Sorensen, principal research associate at The Urban
Institute; and, finally, Joan Entmacher, vice president and director of Family
Economic Security at the National Women's Law Center.</p>
<p>With that, Mr. Young to testify, please.</p>
<p><b><a name="young"></a>STATEMENT OF NATHANIEL L. YOUNG, JR., DIRECTOR,
VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES' DIVISION OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT,
RICHMOND, VIRGINIA; PRESIDENT, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS;
BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION; AND BOARD
MEMBER, EASTERN REGIONAL INTERSTATE CHILD SUPPORT ASSOCIATION</p>
</b>
<p>Mr. YOUNG. Yes, sir. My name is Nick Young, and I am the director of Child
Support Enforcement for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and I am also the
president of the National Council of Child Support Directors, the 54 child
support directors of the Nation. I appreciate being here today. Thank you very
much.</p>
<p>I looked at a calendar and saw that our birthday, the Nation's birthday, is
next Wednesday, 225 years. Then I saw it took us 199 years to pass the Social
Security Act in 1975 to where we realized that this was as a problem that we
needed to address.</p>
<p>Then, in the ensuing 25 years that we have been doing child support, as is
in the statement that you just entered from Mr. Fuentes, we have collected
$100 billion through good hard work of the child support program and through
the laws and the tools that you have given us, and we are very appreciative of
that.</p>
<p>I would like to mention that the $18 billion that was collected last year
shows the significant improvement that has been made. If you tried to break
the $100 billion by 25 years and then looked at one year that you got $18
billion, it is getting better.</p>
<p>While you are precisely correct that the average may be 37 percent, some
States do better than that. Some do worse. All in all, though, we are very
proud of the $18 billion, and we do appreciate the tools you have given us. I
think we have demonstrated that we have used them responsibly, not necessarily
to deliver child support services, truly at the end of a billy club, but try
to bring the personal responsibility into the picture here by working with a
number of the people that are here at the table as well as the other groups.</p>
<p>I have two or three things to recommend. My testimony has some examples
from each of your States, from many of the States, anyway, and I will let that
stand for itself.</p>
<p>One of the things that we would encourage you to do is to literally stay
the course. Remember that this is not a speed sport, that it is behavior
modification. It is difficult. As Representative Johnson just spoke and the
others as well very eloquently, we are trying to fix a long-term problem, and
we are trying to do it in a fairly short period of time, and it is behavior
modification, not always out-of-wedlock births, which in my particular State
make up 70 percent of the caseload. While 30 percent of the out-of-wedlock
births occur every year, they cumulatively make up 70 percent of the caseload.
I submit to you that that is the problem we have to fix before we try to fix
the outcome which is getting the child support paid.</p>
<p>We support the simplification of distribution. It is far too complex. Most
of us cannot understand it. We cannot explain it. We can eventually program it
into logic, but we could not explain it if we had to.</p>
<p>I would only ask you to look at how the child support program is funded
concurrently with your desires to fix distribution. You may be fixing
distribution, but you could break the way that a State delivers the child
support services, depending on whether or not they had retained earnings or
whether or not they totally general-fund a child support program, and about
half the States used retained earnings. We think that they are inextricably
intertwined; that you have got to look at them simultaneously.</p>
<p>We would also encourage you to look at removing the cap on the incentive
pool. Clearly, we believe that pay for performance is the way to go. We
incentivize most of our child support workers on how well they do. Currently,
with the incentive cap, somebody has to lose because it is a fixed amount of
money. So, if Virginia does very well, perhaps Maryland or some other State
will be disadvantaged, and we do not think that is a good way to do it. We
would ask you to examine that and to consider removing the cap.</p>
<p>One other issue that is problematic is the penalties. The penalties were
enacted for a very good reason, to get people's attention, primarily not the
Title IV-D of the Social Security Act (IV-D) director, the child support
director, but beyond that in the State legislatures.</p>
<p>We are convinced as an association that the penalties have done their job,
and they have gotten people's attention. I would ask you to look at some
reinvestment options in amending the law some States face up to, including
$152 million in penalties. That will certainly get your attention because that
is twice as much as most programs even spend. We would only ask that there are
some ways to allow reinvestment and to encourage reinvestment instead of just
having the penalty stand alone by itself.</p>
<p>Lastly, the IV-D directors, the child support directors clearly understand
the need for more fatherhood initiatives. Access and visitation is a wonderful
program. It has brought people together that were not talking, both government
as well as within the family structure. We realize there are a number of these
people that are dead broke, not necessarily deadbeat.</p>
<p>We are willing to work with any of the programs on fatherhood, and we will
appreciate any of the initiatives that are coming out. And some of the ladies
and gentlemen who are with me can speak far more eloquently on that.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you, Mr. Young.</p>
<p>Now we will hear from Dr. Johnson, and, Dr. Johnson, I do notice that you
are accompanied by Mr. Raymond Byrd. If he would like to join you at the

like to.</p>
<p>Thank you. Welcome to our Committee, Mr. Byrd.</p>
<b>
<p><a name="jjohnson"></a>STATEMENT OF JEFFERY M. JOHNSON, PH.D., PRESIDENT
AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL CENTER FOR STRATEGIC NONPROFIT PLANNING
AND COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP; ACCOMPANIED BY RAYMOND BYRD, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND</p>
</b>
<p>Dr. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Chairman Herger, Mr. Cardin, and the
Committee for inviting me and Mr. Byrd for this opportunity.</p>
<p>I would also add that I have also invited a nationally recognized leader in
the fatherhood movement and also the program administrator for the program
that Mr. Byrd is a part of, Mr. Joe Jones. I also asked another young father
who is improving his life, Mr. Joe Lewis, to join us today in this testimony.
Additionally I have asked Ms. Teresa Kaiser who is the director for Child
Support for the State of Maryland, to join us today. She has some interesting
ideas on arrears management that the Committee might be interested in.</p>
<p>Before I say some things, let me just say, Mr. Chairman, that today is both
a good day for me, for this opportunity to talk about fatherhood, but it is
also a day of reflection for me because it is also the thirty-sixth
anniversary of my own father's death, and that I come to this Committee in
reflection of the good things that my father demonstrated to me. I think that
those things contributed in many respects to the work that I do, but also how
important it is to have fathers in the life of children. I think that is
really what this Committee and this work is all about.</p>
<p>With that, let me just say that the work that we do at NPCL is focused on
building the capacity of local agencies to strengthen communities and foster
family and neighborhood empowerment.</p>
<p>One critical element of family empowerment, particularly in inner cities,
is the return of fathers to families. Our current focus is to build the
capacity of community-based organizations to provide services to low-income
fathers so they can adopt their critical roles as nurturers and economic
providers which at a time when society seems to be suffering from numerous
breakdowns is good for families and communities, but especially children.</p>
<p>Any policies we develop should not pose additional barriers to low-income
dads. So, when this Committee considers child support, Welfare to Work,
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) commitments and others, do not
forget our fragile families. These are young, low-skilled, never-married
couples with children. We are talking about dead-broke dads versus deadbeat
dads. The difference between deadbeat dads and dead-broke dads is that the
former can pay child support, but will not, and the latter are willing to pay
child support, but cannot. Deadbeat dads should be punished. Dead-broke dads
need support and help.</p>
<p>Any responsible fatherhood proposal should provide for employment, peer
support, parenting education, parenting skills development, conflict
management, as well as a combination of short-term job acquisition, interim
job training, and long-term career development strategies. Child support
enforcement proposals should consider different provisions for handling
dead-broke dad cases.</p>
<p>For example, orders established for low-income fathers should be based on
their ability to pay. This approach has been embraced by child support leaders
such as the National Child Support Enforcement Association and has been a
topic of NPCL's peer learning college where we bring together child support
people to talk about these issues.</p>
<p>Other important strategies include arrears management. Again, I will say
that Teresa Kaiser who is here for the State of Maryland has implemented a
very innovative program that I think this Committee would be very interested
in hearing about.</p>
<p>My more extended written testimony, discusses in detail our Partners For
Fragile Families Project which brought to us Mr. Byrd. This is a 10-city
initiative that targets young fathers, 16 to 25, and builds upon 40 years of
social policy research and experimentation in this area. Each demonstration
site seeks to implement community-level partnerships between child support
enforcement agencies and local community-based fatherhood programs in an
effort to increase the long-term involvement of low-income fathers in the
lives of their children.</p>
<p>Eliminating policy and program barriers as well as placement of fathers in
jobs that have a wage potential are also key aims of the demonstration, but
the foundation of the program, which is consistent with much of the provisions
in H.R. 1471, is looking at where a client is and working with that client to
bring them up to the point where they can marry, but if they don't marry, make
the best decision in the interest of their child.</p>
<p>The basic model includes One on One case management, job placement, peer
support. The community should know that peer support has been the most
successful element of programs working with fathers over the last 20 years, at
least as far as demonstration projects are concerned.</p>
<p>Peer support groups are anchored in this program in what we call the
Fatherhood Development Curriculum which is now being used by over 3,000
practitioners nationwide. The curriculum includes a range of topics from life
skills to preventing domestic violence. The father development curriculum also
includes a focus on family planning with topics such as marriage and team
parenting.</p>
<p>In terms of systemic change, we think that efforts should be focused on
public-private partnerships, employability, and earnings for fathers. Research
seems to suggest that men who are employed and earning are more likely to pay
child support and stay in a relationship and often marry the mother of their
children.</p>
<p>H.R. 1471, we believe comes closest to providing the scope of policy
reforms, we need to strengthen father involvement, as well as a reasonable
start on funding. Given the scope of services needed to support a father's
role until a dad can support his family, we need a significant public
investment.</p>
<p>While conceptually sound, neither the President's proposal nor the Carson
proposal is comprehensive enough to really do the work necessary for fathers
in fragile families. Child support funding changes that will allow for
pass-through payments and new fatherhood demonstrations that are included in
H.R. 1471 is a start in the right direction, we believe.</p>
<p>In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Committee again for this
opportunity and encourage you now to hear from Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Lewis, and
also, if time permits, to also hear the innovative strategy that Ms. Kaiser is
working on for the record. Thank you.</p>
<p>[The prepared statement of <a href="6-28jjoh.htm">Dr. Johnson</a> follows:]</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you, Dr. Johnson. Mr. Byrd, would you like a couple
minutes?</p>
<p>Mr. BYRD. Yes. Could you speak up? I cannot really hear you that much.</p>
<p>My name is--well, you already know my name, but I am in this trial program,
and I am not a deadbeat dad, but I was a dead-broke dad, but recently I got a
job. It really, actually gave me the positivity knowing would I be able to go
get a job. I went to like two, three group meetings. I have been to three
fatherhood conferences with Mr. Joe Jones and I spoke on that panel three
times, and I am not really saying that I am like underskilled or
underachieved, but it is just that most people do not give us a chance because
they would judge us by what they see us as instead of not getting to know the
person, not knowing the person that is behind the clothes.</p>
<p>What I am here for today is to know what type--</p>
<p>I am kind of nervous, as you can see.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. You are doing just fine. You are doing just fine.</p>
<p>Mr. BYRD. And mostly, when I go to the group, like when I have problems, I
call and I talk to either Mr. Rice or Mr. Joe Jones. They give me input on
different situations, and right now, what I am going through, they was telling
me about how I got to learn how to play the ball game. Like if I am going for
a certain job, I have to look like the people working in order for them to
look at me to put me on their team. I just cannot go into a job and say,
&quot;Hey, this is me. I want to get this,&quot; without having the proper
attire or the proper frame of mind. I cannot go in there if I am comfortable.
I have to go in there looking like I am ready to play their game. That is all.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you very much, Mr. Byrd. I appreciate that. Dr.
Haskins?</p>
<p><b><a name="haskins"></a>STATEMENT OF RON HASKINS, PH.D., SENIOR FELLOW,
BROOKINGS INSTITUTION, AND SENIOR CONSULTANT, ANNIE E. CASEY FOUNDATION,
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND</p>
</b>
<p>Dr. HASKINS. Chairman Herger, thank you for having me today. I am pleased
to be here on the other side of the microphone and learn that all of the
members actually have a front to their bodies. For several years, I got to
study the backs of members for hours and hours. Also, I believe this is the
first hearing I have been to in probably a decade that I did not write the
opening statement. I was especially pleased that Matt agreed to write my
statement for me. So I did not have to write anything for this hearing.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. I hope the front looks almost as well as the back.</p>
<p>Mr. HASKINS. Pardon?</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. I hope the front looks almost as well as the back.</p>
<p>Dr. HASKINS. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, of course, it is.</p>
<p>Mr. Cardin, I am afraid we will not have much of a chance to disagree
today. There may be a few little things in child support that we could
disagree about, but I hope you invite me back again when you talk about
welfare.</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. Since you wrote the bill, I would hope you do not have too much
to say critical of it.</p>
<p>Dr. HASKINS. Let me first say that I think the first thing the Committee
should do in considering reauthorization is to reflect on the success that
this bill has had. There are failures, of course, but in almost every title,
not just the TANF title, not just because of more work, but in the child
support title, in the Supplemental Security Income titles, the bill has
achieved its intended effects. and I would say on the whole that we probably
have fewer people in the United States today dependent on welfare benefits as
their primary source of income than we have had probably since the depression
or certainly since the 1950's. That is a major achievement and this Committee
is the first Committee that wrote the original draft of the bill. So I think
that is a remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>However, I do think there are three things in child support enforcement
that the Committee should attend to. Two of them, I believe would have
immediate or intermediate impacts, the Committee would not have to wait very
long to have good impacts, and the third one may avoid a crisis. So I would
like to talk about each of those three in turn.</p>
<p>The first is who gets the money, and Mrs. Johnson and others have already
spoken eloquently about this. When we started the child support program way
back in the 1970's, the main idea was cost recovery. We were trying to
reimburse taxpayers for paying for welfare. That is still a worthy idea, but
since then, our welfare system has changed dramatically, and now we emphasize
to a great extent people becoming independent of welfare. As that goal has
shifted of our welfare program, more and more members have come to see that
the child support system should also shift. So the arrearages that we used to
retain to repay taxpayers and the money that we retain (all the money when the
family is on welfare) a lot of people think should be given back to the
families.</p>
<p>We made a very important step in that direction at the initiative of this
Subcommittee in 1996. We were blocked from taking the entire step by the
United States Senate, which often happens to our magnificent legislation, and
last year, we tried to take this step and, again, were prevented by the Senate
from doing it. But I would guess that if this bill passes again that the
Senate will act on it and that we will, in fact, be able to return that money
to the mothers--get the money from the fathers to the mothers.</p>
<p>I want you to know that when fully implemented, this provision would
provide about $900 million per year to mothers who have left welfare. So that
is a lot of money. It is money that the father paid. This is extremely worthy
legislation, and I hope the Subcommittee can pass it.</p>
<p>The second issue is fatherhood. Many other witnesses have talked about
that, so I can just skim through that very briefly. But I do want to point
out, I think there is no question that, especially Republicans, but on a
bipartisan basis, I believe, in the next 18 months or so, we will emphasize
marriage. There will be a huge emphasis on marriage in welfare reform
reauthorization, and I would point out to the Subcommittee that, to some
extent, to reemphasize marriage without emphasizing fatherhood and
particularly the problems that are experienced by low-income fathers, is
somewhat hypocritical because we could not in all good conscience promote
marriage when we have so many fathers who are unemployed. Their income has
been declining for approximately the last decade. They have lots of other
problems. Many are incarcerated. We simply need to find a better way to deal
with these young men and to help them to a greater extent than we have in the
past. Unless we do that, the marriage agenda, I think, has a very serious
flaw.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to call the Committee's attention to what I think is
a long-term problem that will be very important for the States in the years
ahead unless something is done. If you look at pages 6 and 7 of my testimony,
you will see that there have been huge increases in collections in the
non-welfare program, but if you look in the welfare program, collections are
actually decreasing, and the reason for that is obvious. We have many fewer
cases on welfare than in the past.</p>
<p>The Committee should take this into account. The average State gets 30
percent of the money to finance their child support program from their welfare
collections. So, as these collections go down, many States are going to have
difficulty, especially the half that Nick Young referred to that finance their
program directly out of those collections. They are going to have greater and
greater trouble, and they are going to have to go back to their State
legislatures and ask for more money.</p>
<p>So I do not know what the solution to this problem is. I have not heard of
a good solution, but I think this Subcommittee with its long history of
looking ahead and emphasizing financing issues and nitty-gritty issues about
this program should look into this very carefully, should work cooperatively
with the administration, with the IV-D directors and other bureaucratic
organizations to see if, within the next 2 or 3 years, we can really develop a
solution for this problem.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Chairman, I would like to especially call to your attention in
closing the fact that if this Committee were able to pass the provision to
distribute more of the collections to the mothers that we would have an
immediate impact on these families. The year after it passes, these families
will start to have more money, and within 5 or 6 years, they will be receiving
$900 million of money paid by the fathers. So that is an extremely important
action for this Committee to take.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>[The prepared statement of <a href="6-28hask.htm">Dr. Haskins</a> follows:]</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you very much, Dr. Haskins. Again, the Committee,
and I, want to thank you for your many years of guidance and support on this
Committee.</p>
<p>Dr. HASKINS. Thank you.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. With that, we will turn to Dr. Sorensen.</p>
<p><b><a name="sorensen"></a>STATEMENT OF ELAINE SORENSEN, PH.D., PRINCIPAL
RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, INCOME AND BENEFITS POLICY CENTER, URBAN INSTITUTE</p>
</b>
<p>Dr. SORENSEN. Chairman Herger and other members of the Committee, thank you
for this opportunity to testify. I have been working on this issue for many
years, and I would like to make three points today.</p>
<p>First, child support enforcement has made a difference in poor children's
lives, and that is the success that we should commend Congress for
encouraging.</p>
<p>Two, despite this success, there are many non-custodial fathers who are
poor themselves and need help.</p>
<p>Three, child support enforcement, to be successful in the future and reach
more poor children, will need to face the problems of poor, non-custodial
fathers.</p>
<p>My research and that of many others show that expanding the child support
enforcement program has improved child support collections, especially for
never-married mothers who, 20 years ago, were very unlikely to receive child
support. So we have had success. The specific policies that have been very
successful are the in-hospital paternity establishment program, and immediate
wage withholding. More recent programs like the new hire program, State
disbursement units have been very successful in specific States.</p>
<p>My research shows, that child support for poor children has increased since
the enactment of welfare reform in 1996. We find that 29 percent of poor
families were receiving child support in 1996, and that is up today. Also, the
amount of family income coming from child support compared to 1996. So child
support is playing a more important role in poor families' lives.</p>
<p>Despite these gains, though, we still have 5.5 million poor children who
are poor and do not receive child support. Part of the reason that child
support has not reached these poor kids is because their fathers have a
limited ability to pay child support. There are about 2.5 million
non-custodial fathers who are poor themselves, and they have many of the same
employment barriers that poor moms do.</p>
<p>We find that 43 percent of them are high school dropouts, 40 percent of
poor non-custodial fathers have health problems, most of them do not have
health insurance, about a third of them have not worked for a long time. When
they do work, their earnings are low. They are having a hard time meeting
their own needs as well as their non-custodial children.</p>
<p>One of the employment barriers that disproportionately affect fathers that
does not affect mothers as much is incarceration. We estimate that about 30
percent of poor, non-custodial fathers are incarcerated.</p>
<p>Despite these employment barriers, very few non-custodial fathers receive
assistance in the employment area. We find that only about 6 percent of poor
fathers, all of whom could benefit from employment services, are getting
employment services.</p>
<p>In order for child support to be more effective in the future and reach
more poor kids, research shows that more money needs to go towards the father
to get him employed. Employment-oriented programs right now are mostly funded
out of the Welfare to Work program, but this program ends soon. The question
is how will employment programs for low-income fathers be funded in the
future.</p>
<p>As a society, we have invested in poor mothers so that their children can
live with them in their homes, and we have been successful. We have invested
in the child support enforcement program so that children can count on the
financial support of both their mom and their dad.</p>
<p>To build upon this success, it is time to invest in poor, non-custodial
fathers so that they, too, can contribute to the financial support of their
children.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>[The prepared statement of <a href="6-28sore.htm">Dr. Sorensen</a>
follows:]</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you, Dr. Sorensen. Now Ms. Entmacher to testify.</p>
<b>
<p><a name="entmacher"></a>STATEMENT OF JOAN ENTMACHER, VICE PRESIDENT AND
DIRECTOR, FAMILY ECONOMIC SECURITY, NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER</p>
</b>
<p>Ms. ENTMACHER. Thank you.</p>
<p>Chairman Herger and members of the Human Resources Subcommittee, I
appreciate this opportunity to testify on behalf of the National Women's Law
Center.</p>
<p>There are three main points I want to make in my testimony. First, the
child support reforms enacted by Congress in 1996 have substantially improved
the performance of the child support program. We have been critical of the
performance of the program for a number of years. We have worked to improve it
virtually since it was enacted, and so it is very exciting to be able to say
that the preliminary data show that collections have doubled over the last 5
years. This is a real thrill for an advocate.</p>
<p>The second point is that while these increases in child support are
benefiting many low-income families, some poor children are not receiving
support because the money the child support system collects on their behalf
does not go to them, but instead goes for welfare reimbursement. For once, I
can simply refer to Dr. Haskins' testimony and say he is absolutely right that
nearly $1 billion a year should be going to children and their custodial
parents. So we completely agree on the importance of that reform which is in
1471.</p>
<p>Third, some custodial fathers, like many custodial mothers, are poor
themselves and have limited capacity to support their children. We need to
improve services for both parents and the earning capacity of both parents in
the next stage of welfare reform if we want to bring children out of poverty
and not just off of welfare. However, we do have much less information about
the effectiveness of different service strategies for non-custodial parents as
compared to the research that has been done on custodial parents, and the
funding for demonstration programs in H.R. 1471, which is targeted to
non-custodial parents, would help fill this gap.</p>
<p>To return to point one, the 1996 reforms were designed to create a more
automated, integrated, and nationwide child support enforcement system.
Implementing these reforms has not been easy, as you, Chairman Herger, have
reason to know in California, and the process is not yet complete, but, even
so, the improvements have been dramatic.</p>
<p>Between 1995 and 2000, the collection rates for cases with orders in the
IV-D program doubled. In 1995, even when an order was put in place,
collections were made in only about a third of cases. In 2000, collections
were made in more than two-thirds of cases, and as you have heard, collections
have risen 64 percent from 11 to $18 billion.</p>
<p>Child support is extremely important for the low-income families who
receive it. It accounts on average for 16 percent of family income of families
who get child support, but for poor families not on welfare who are eligible
to receive all the current support that is collected, child support provides
over a third of the family's income. So that brings me to my next point which
is the importance of changing the assignment and distribution rules to give
more child support to families.</p>
<p>The National Women's Law Center has been working with the Center on
Fathers, Families, and Public Policy, and a group of other advocates,
practitioners, and researchers who work with low-income mothers and similar
people who work with low-income fathers to see if we can come together on
recommendations to improve policies for mothers, fathers, and children.</p>
<p>This policy change of giving child support to families was one that people
clearly agreed on, not just because of the value of the income, which was
certainly important, but also because of the costs that are paid in terms of
hostility to the child support system and hostility toward the other parent
that are generated by our current system.</p>
<p>Mothers are frustrated because they do not see any contribution by the
fathers. Fathers are frustrated because child support is being collected from
them, but it is not getting through the child, and instead of bringing people
together, current policies drive them apart.</p>
<p>We also know something that we did not have information about last year
when this policy was being considered. Wisconsin implemented a policy of
passing through and disregarding all child support to children, and the
results of that experiment are now in. We see that mothers got more support.
Fathers were more likely to pay support, and there was not an increase in
overall government cost because, even though the State was giving up these
collections, it was offset by savings in other government programs.</p>
<p>I would urge the Committee to act quickly on this reform. The
simplification of the distribution system would make a difference to States
like California that are still in the process of designing their computer
systems. So sooner rather than later would make a big difference.</p>
<p>I see my time is up.</p>
<p>[The prepared statement of <a href="6-28entm.htm">Ms. Entmacher</a>
follows:]</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you very much for your testimony.</p>
<p>Now to inquire, the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Watkins.</p>
<p>Mr. WATKINS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to you and Mr. Cardin for your
commitment, and also to the entire panel. I have been very impressed with the
sincerity and commitment. I know Dr. Haskins is truly a champion.</p>
<p>Welfare reform has been a truly remarkable piece of work. I think it has
been one of the things that has really changed society. I totally agree with
Dr. Johnson about employment.</p>
<p>Three of four of you have talked about employment, and that is what I have
been all about in my years of public service is the fact that I think without
question, the destruction of many families has come about because they have
had to go and search for other jobs. I probably am a little harder about this
than most people, and I ask forgiveness of my Committee here and I apologize
to you, but I was born in dirt-poor poverty and my family had to leave
Oklahoma and go to California three times before I was 9 years of age. It
destroyed my family, and my father became an alcoholic and died as an
alcoholic. My mother raised three of us children on a dirt-poor farm, and I
had to work three part-time jobs to get an education. So I know the importance
of that work.</p>
<p>I also had to work my way through college to get a college education. So it
can be done.</p>
<p>So I probably take a harder nose on this than I should be, and I apologize
for that. That is why I like to say we each have to accept some
responsibilities as we go along. I am not saying that is the whole answer, but
working and providing some work. You are right. Child support is not near the
amount that it should be, and many times it is misused, a lot of times. Most
cannot make it on child support, but the person that is responsible for
bringing that child into this life should be responsible and should be also
working to make some payments, whatever that job is, for the community or
wherever it may be.</p>
<p>I think we found that out in welfare reform, and I know my father did not
pay child support. Lots of times, we did not know where the next meal was
coming from.</p>
<p>So I apologize for being a little stronger about this, but I think let's do
not miss that dimension; that we have to try to make sure we provide the jobs
for, yes, holding the families together, but also to provide the jobs for that
person to accept the responsibility to know that they are working these hours
because they have brought someone in the world and they are going to have to
help pay for, the responsibility for that child's life.</p>
<p>So I do not disagree with the testimony I have heard here at all. I think
it is great, and let me say again the welfare changes have been marvelous,
just tremendous. Maybe we need to tweak the child support situation more
around work and some responsibilities along that line.</p>
<p>So thank you very much for what you are doing each and every day and for
your testimony.</p>
<p>And, Mr. Byrd, may you have God's speed. It takes a lot of strong will. My
mother used to say, &quot;Wesley, if you have a will, there is a way.&quot;</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you, Mr. Watkins. Mr. Cardin to inquire.</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me thank all the
witnesses for their testimony. I particularly want to thank Mr. Byrd for being
here, not just because you come from, as Mayor O'Malley says, the best city in
America, Baltimore, but that you give a face to the issues.</p>
<p>A lot of times, we talk about statistics, number of people that are
impacted in the policies here, and we never get to see the people that are
individually impacted. We thank you for being here because you add a dimension
to this hearing that is very important for us to see and here.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson, I take it from your testimony--and I would like you to respond
a little more to this--that to the extent that the non-custodial parent, the
father, is employable or has a skill means it is more likely that the mother
would consider the father a candidate for marriage. Is that a positive
correlation?</p>
<p>Dr. JOHNSON. That is a definite positive correlation, and it has been made
by sociologists. It is being made by economists right now. When fathers are
made marriage-able, they are attractive marriage mates.</p>
<p>It is interesting. We did have an opportunity to bring some young fathers
from Mr. Jones' program before the Committee when Mr. Shaw was Chair, and one
of the young men indicated, asked Mr. Shaw, &quot;Would you want your daughter
to marry me?,&quot; looking at his situation. In a situation where he was
trying to do the best he could, he had had some challenges in his life, and
that he really needed to get those things together to make himself attractive.
I think the thing that is often overshadowed sometimes is the young father's
willingness to be the best man he can be, to be the best father he could be,
and to also in the future be a good husband.</p>
<p>I can recall when my older brother--I am from the Detroit area originally.
I have been in this area about 22 years. When he got his first job at Ford
Motor Company, when those jobs were available, I can remember him getting the
phone call from Reverend S.L. Roberson from the Ford Motor Company down the
street from me, and he said that once he got the call that he was going to get
him a car, get him an apartment, and he might even get married because he made
a positive correlation between his financial stability and being able to make
those type of choices. I think that given the chance--I think that Mr. Byrd
said, do not look at the cover of the book, look at what is inside of the
book, and here is a man trying to do the best for himself, trying to do the
best for his family, but we need programs like the Center for Fathers,
Families and Workforce Development in place to create an on ramp for people
like Mr. Byrd so that they can reach their dreams and be the best parents to
children as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. Thank you for that response.</p>
<p>Dr. Haskins, it is a pleasure to have you return to our Committee, and I,
once again, want to congratulate you on your public service. You have reason
to be proud, as we are proud, of the accomplishments that we have made in
reforming our welfare system and our child support system, and you were by far
one of the key individuals. So I applaud you for that and congratulate you on
your public service.</p>
<p>I think my list, though, is longer than two in modification of the 1996
law. I am one of those who supported those.</p>
<p>Dr. HASKINS. Yes, but you have more than 5 minutes, Mr. Cardin.</p>
<p>[Laughter.]</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. That is true, also.</p>
<p>Let me also point out, I know that your quip about marriage and
Republicans--let me just tell you that I have been married for 36 years, and
my spouse and I are both Democrats. So there are Democrats who do believe that
marriage is a very important institution.</p>
<p>But let me just caution you that we support--the Democrats support, and I
think there is a bipartisan agreement, the importance of marriage and the
importance of two-parent families, but we also as Republicans have a concern
about spousal abuse and child abuse. We are concerned about safety of
families. We want to make sure that our policies are the right policies for
families.</p>
<p>You made a very interesting point, and I think it is worth emphasizing. For
a while, our policy was cost recovery. Now it is really family support and
bringing the family together. It is really nice to see that from all sides,
there is agreement that passing through child support makes sense.</p>
<p>If you could just clarify for me why did we--we put families first for
families that left welfare on just about everything except for the tax
intercept program. Why didn't we give them access to tax intercepts in 1996?</p>
<p>Dr. HASKINS. In the 1996 legislation?</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. Yes.</p>
<p>Dr. HASKINS. Oh, very simple answer. The Senate would not accept giving the
entire amount to the families. So staff in the middle of the night was casting
about trying to figure out a way that you could plausibly, logically divide up
the money, and we received information that about half the money came from the
tax intercept. So we used the tax intercept. States get to keep all
collections from the tax intercept, and the rest goes to the family. That is
100 percent of the reason. It was just a convenience, and as many things that
staff thinks up in the middle of the night, it cluttered up the--</p>
<p>Mr. CARDIN. It just goes to show you should not work in the middle of the
night.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you very much, Mr. Cardin.</p>
<p>I want to thank each of our witnesses.</p>
<p>Mr. WATKINS. If I might make one comment. We are talking about self-esteem
here, trying--and what do we do, Mr. Chairman, to help young men and young
women develop a self-esteem that they can achieve and they can do those
things, and that is inside. You can hardly measure that commitment or that
determination to do that, and how we can help our young people develop more
self-esteem is going to be very crucial for us to succeed.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. A very important point. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr. Byrd, again, it is good to have each of our witnesses. It is
particularly--I want you to know that we particularly appreciate you being
here. You had mentioned how you were a little nervous. I think everyone is a
little nervous who perhaps is here, and, again, I commend you.</p>
<p>I would like to have you respond, if you would, to what perhaps you have
learned through the fatherhood program that you are involved in, do you feel
you have changed in any ways because of that, and what are your hopes for the
future.</p>
<p>Mr. BYRD. Well, actually, through the fatherhood programs, I actually
learned a couple of things about myself, and the day someone directed me, it
was like some things I do--I still have a little immaturity in me, and I kind
of like thought that I--I honestly tried to like not look at it, but then I
thought about it. Some things I do, do, it is kind of immature. Then,
hopefully, in the future--well, actually, I will actually look at--when I get
out of school, maybe I might join a branch of the government and then I am
looking to buy a computer. I was up in the Families Helping Families Center,
looking at the computers they had up there, and maybe in the future--I was
thinking about--they kept like haggling me about getting married, and marriage
was not something I wanted right now. It is something that I look for in the
future, but as you look at it, a lot of people you see married, and you are
like, &quot;I will see this person for the rest of my life,&quot; and it is
like you really got to think on it because you do not want to rush into
nothing and that you cannot get out of, and then marriage is a big
responsibility. It is just like when you have a kid. You always got that
person. You always know you have to look after that person. That person is
going to be there for you.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr. BYRD. A lot of things I did learn was that if you are down and you are
trying to help yourself, if people see you helping--if you struggling and you
need help and you are not trying to help yourself, no one is going to help
you, but if you ask for help and someone will help you if they see you are
trying to help yourself. Nobody is going to help you if you are not trying to
help yourself, and you cannot do--nobody cannot make you do something you do
not want to do. If you are going to do it and you ask for help, they are going
to give you the proper guidance and the proper assistance for you to do
whatever task that you are trying to complete.</p>
<p>Chairman HERGER. Good. Thank you very much, Mr. Byrd.</p>
<p>Again, I want to thank each of our witnesses for your fine testimony this
afternoon. I trust that each of you would respond to additional questions on
these issues for the record. It has been a very informative hearing on an
issue that is important to members of this Committee and to the President.</p>
<p>With that, this Committee stands adjourned. Thank you.</p>

<i>July 11, 2001</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Honorable Wally Herger, Chairman<br>
Subcommittee on Human Resources<br>
U.S. Committee on House Ways and Means<br>
1102 Longworth House Office Building<br>
Washington, DC 20515</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Dear Chairman Herger:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Subcommittees
follow-up questions to testimony I presented on June 28. The following
responses are presented in the order of the questions in your June 29 letter.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Q.&nbsp; A general trend several witnesses cited is the
progression away from a child support system focused on cost recovery to one
that promotes family self-sufficiency. What are some innovative programs
Virginia has developed that promote the goal of self-sufficiency for families?
How about other States? What implications does that have for your office in
terms of administrative workload? Expense? How have those issues been
addressed?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">A.&nbsp; </font></b><font size="2">Since the passage of the
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) in
1996, additional emphasis has been placed on the importance of children having
the financial and the emotional support of both parents. Programs that provide
services such as education and training, job placement, parenting classes, and
mentoring are now viewed as critical to helping low-income children escape
poverty.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Because welfare today is time-limited and child support is
becoming a key family resource, our focus has shifted somewhat from a cost
recovery program to one of preparing both parents to take responsibility for
the support of their children. In Virginias child support enforcement
program, we are involved in several innovative programs that vary by community
in promoting self-sufficiency. For example, we have fourteen of our seasoned
child support staff co-located in the local social service agencies. This
offers the customer &quot; one stop shopping&quot; in that they can
communicate with their eligibility worker about benefits, and can communicate
with the child support worker to provide critical information that will assist
our staff in locating the noncustodial parent, establishing paternity and a
child support obligation, and collecting their support order. This co-location
also provides an opportunity for information sharing and program understanding
between the child support worker and the social service worker. In other areas
where co-location is not feasible, we have child support staff who appear
periodically at service points to facilitate child support services for both
custodial and noncustodial parents.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Virginia is fortunate in that we are an administrative
state, which allows us to more efficiently process child support cases rather
than going through the courts. We issue 75 percent of all orders
administratively and preclude further judicial action, unless requested by
either party. This provides for services that are quicker, requires no lawyers
or judges, and gets the child support monies to the custodial parent much
faster than if we had to process all actions through the courts.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">We know that many noncustodial parents take seriously their
responsibility to pay child support regularly. For the majority of parents who
do not readily meet their financial obligations, enforcement tools such as
income withholding, drivers license revocation, or passport denial will
encourage parents to meet their financial obligations to their children.
However, for a small minority of noncustodial parents, even tougher
enforcement tools have been utilized. In Virginia, we have implemented
enforcement tools such as vehicle booting. As described in my testimony of
June 28, 2001, this enforcement technique was first utilized in Virginia in
1998. Since its inception, more than $420,000 has been collected from 79
bootings.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Another enforcement remedy, which is used, by Virginia and
other states is our KidsFirst Campaign which was first implemented in 1997 and
offered limited amnesty to 57,000 of our most egregious support evaders. To
date, Virginia has collected more than $150 million in past due child support
as a result of this initiative. This initiative enhanced our rapport with the
law enforcement community and with the judiciary.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Many of our courts utilize alternatives to incarceration
such as work release or in home incarceration. These programs allow the
noncustodial parent to avoid jail time by continuing to work and meet their
child support obligation as well as making them available to provide emotional
support to their children. This alternative is a savings to the taxpayer and
contributes to the self-sufficiency of the family.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Unique enforcement remedies, such as the two mentioned
above, serve us well in that they educate the public about child support
services that are available, the resulting press encourages other noncustodial
parents to pay their support to avoid these enforcement remedies and the
resulting child support payments assist the families in becoming self
sufficient.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Several states, including Virginia, are involved in grants
that identify barriers to custodial parents applying for child support
services and also barriers to noncustodial parents contributing financial
support to their children. Since these studies have just recently begun, I am
not prepared to discuss findings or make recommendations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">We currently have more than 70 community based fatherhood
initiatives underway in Virginia. One very recent example is the result of a
collaborative effort between Total Action Against Poverty (TAP) and several
agencies including child support enforcement, that provides outreach to
noncustodial parents under the age of 30, who are unemployed or underemployed.
TAP was successful in obtaining a $750,000 grant from the Charles S. Mott
Foundation to target this populace in the Roanoke, Virginia area. This grant
will provide a child support worker at the district office to identify fathers
who might be eligible for the program and refer them for services to enhance
their job skills, help them secure jobs and encourage them to become more
involved in their childrens lives. One caveat to participate in this
program is to ensure the fathers acknowledge paternity and pay their child
support on a regular basis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Many states, including Virginia, have entered into
partnerships with local Head Start associations. We provide literature
regarding child support services and periodically speak to Head Start
participants about our services and the importance of both parents being
involved in the financial and emotional upbringing of their children.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Some of our offices, particularly in rural localities, have
entered into agreements with faith-based organizations, community partners,
employers and local social services agencies under the Workforce Investment
Act. This partnership provides another opportunity to distribute information
on child support services and assist both custodial and noncustodial parents
in accessing these services.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Our core responsibility is to collect and disburse child
support, and we will continue to focus our efforts in that role, remaining
mindful that our partnerships with agencies such as those listed above are
crucial to furthering the self-sufficiency of families. Unfortunately, our
caseloads continue to increase, and we must remain flexible in managing our
resources while staying focused on our primary mission, which is child support
enforcement.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Q.&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human Services
preliminary 1999 child support data tells us that collections were made in
over six million Title IV-D cases, up from 4.5 million in 1998. What actions
can Congress take to help States further improve the percentage of child
support collections?</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2"><b>A.&nbsp;</b> The Personal Responsibility Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) provided states with powerful new tools to
assist in the collection of child support. The National Directory of New Hires
and the Federal Case Registry provide information not previously available to
states in their collection efforts. These new databases have allowed states to
increase the level of automation in their statewide computer systems. The
combination of the new tools and the improved automation are primarily
responsible for the increase in the percentage of collections. Even for
states, like Virginia, which have met all the requirements for PRWORA, there
is more that can be done to increase the level of automation and improve on
the use of the new tools.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">There are two things Congress can do to help states further
improve the percentage of child support collections. One is to extend the
deadline for using the 80 percent enhanced funding for child support computer
systems. Congress designated a pool of 80 percent federal funding to assist
states in meeting these requirements. The deadline for using the 80 percent
funding is October 1, 2001. Many states will not be able to use the full
amount of the 80 percent money allocated to them by the deadline.</font></p>
<font face="Arial">
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</b></font>
<p><font size="2">Extending the deadline to October 1, 2005, will allow states
to take full advantage of enhanced funding to improve and enhance the PRWORA
mandates.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The second is to refrain from making major changes to the
child support program until the full benefits of the existing laws are
realized. In other</font> <font size="2">words &quot;stay the course.&quot;
Although passed in 1996, the PRWORA changes were numerous and complex. States
continue to expand and increase their use of the new tools and laws. Major
changes to the program would divert valuable resources and prevent states from
continuing their effort to make full and complete use of the tools provided by
PRWORA.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Q.&nbsp; How do States handle the issue of access and
visitation, especially by divorced fathers?</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2"><b>A.</b>&nbsp; The Grants to States for Access and
Visitation Grant Programs (A&amp;V) are demonstration grants funded by the
federal government in an effort to increase parental involvement of
noncustodial parents in the lives of their children. Specific activities such
as parent education, counseling, visitation, development of parenting plans
and mediation, are eligible for funding. States are given oversight,
monitoring, and evaluation responsibilities for utilization of grant funds.
Some states are further along with their A&amp;V programs, while others are
just beginning to implement programs to increase parental involvement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Allocations are made to each state from a $10 million
appropriation. Each state must submit an application annually and provide a
ten percent match to receive the funds.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Each state is given the leverage to explore initiatives and
determine how families can benefit best from A&amp;V funds. States administer
A&amp;V programs based on the prevailing needs of their respective
populations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Across the country, A&amp;V programs are administered in
different ways. In California, A&amp;V funds are used to help finance a
statewide-supervised visitation program. Missouri uses A&amp;V funds to
administer a statewide mediation program for its citizens. One year, the State
of Michigan used A&amp;V funds to develop an excellent two-part parent
education video presentation that demonstrated to fathers how to effectively
get involved with their children.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In Virginia, A&amp;V funds are used to help finance
community-based programs, some of which are quite unique. In Northern
Virginia, a program that provides mediation, counseling, and education
services to teenage parents, primarily Hispanic, benefits from A&amp;V
funding. A parent education and visitation program for incarcerated
noncustodial parents in Williamsburg, Virginia and surrounding counties
received A&amp;V funding. In Newport News, A&amp;V funding is used to help
noncustodial parents, who may have fallen victim to substance abuse or
incarceration, regain custody of their children. In Winchester, Virginia and
surrounding counties, a parent education program where divorced parents are
the predominant population served, A&amp;V funds are used to foster healthier
relationships between divorced parents and their children. Children also
attend this program. At least four supervised visitation centers across the
Commonwealth receive A&amp;V funding.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">We do not have information available on specific state
efforts to target divorced fathers. Typically, divorced fathers are included
in parent education, mediation, visitation, and counseling services offered
under A&amp;V programs.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Q.&nbsp; On the issue of penalties on States that fail to
meet the administrative standards for their child support systems, I note you
have a proposal on Page 6 of your testimony. (Currently California, Michigan
and South Carolina are in penalty.) Could you give us more information about
the proposal you described? Relieving penalties in this way would have the
effect of raising federal spending as the current penalty is subtracted from
federal funds sent to the States to operate their child support systems. Do
you have any idea how much this proposed change would cost? Are there other
suggestions in this vein?</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2"><b>A.</b>&nbsp; As I described in my written testimony to
the Subcommittee, the National Council of Child Support Directors (NCCSD)
supports a policy that allows a state, which is under automation penalties, to
reinvest those penalties into program improvements and system compliance. You
requested more information on that proposal. Therefore, I am including the
full text of the NCCSD resolution describing this reinvestment approach. I am
also including resolutions passed by the National Governors Association (NGA),
the American Public Human Services Association (APHSA) and the National
Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), all of which support the same
proposal for penalty reinvestment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">You also asked about the potential costs to the federal
government of the reinvestment proposal. It is difficult to know any exact
costs of reinvestment because penalties are in place only as long as a state
remains out of compliance with system requirements. Once a state incurring
penalties comes into compliance, the penalties end. Second, any federal costs
will depend on how much a state elects to reinvest into its program and system
development. Under the proposal described above, the penalty base is adjusted
by the amount that a state spent for information technology in the previous
year. Thus, any potential costs would depend on the amount that states
incurring penalties are expending on information technology costs. What is
known is the estimated penalty amount that states which are currently
incurring penalties will pay in this budget year: South Carolina: $5.3
million; Michigan: $38.7 million; and California: $111 million. The estimated
amounts for the next fiscal year are: South Carolina: $6.4 million; Michigan:
$46.8 million; and California: $152 Million. Importantly, under this proposal
any penalty amount reinvested is going directly into the Child Support Program
to support system and program improvements.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Finally, you inquired about other reinvestment suggestions.
One proposal currently calls for the establishment of a &quot;base year&quot;
for both penalty amounts and reinvestment amounts. Under this concept the
&quot;base year&quot; would be the fiscal year <i><u>before</u></i> the
penalty was applied. The amount the state spent in that &quot;base year&quot;
would be used to calculate the penalty for every year the state is under the
penalty. In addition, the amount of the states general fund spent in the <i><u>previous
fiscal year</u></i> that is in <b>excess</b> of the amount of the states
general fund spent in the &quot;<i><u>base year</u>&quot;</i> would be
available for reinvestment. If reinvested in the IV-D program, the states
penalty would be reduced by the amount reinvested. This approach clearly
corrects the unintended consequence of penalizing someone for trying to fix a
problem. For example, Californias penalty increased by 48.4 percent ($36.2
million) this year alone just because it has increased program spending. In
Michigan, the penalty increased by 29.97 percent ($11.6 million) due to
increased program spending. In South Carolina, spending did not significantly
increase due to the state being in mediation with its contractor. South
Carolina expects spending to increase in the next fiscal year in the 20-30
percent range. The cost of the reinvestment component would be based on
whatever the states choose to reinvest up to the total amount of the penalty.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Q.&nbsp; Is Virginia promoting fatherhood programs through
your State</font></b><font size="2"><b>s child support office? Are these
programs receiving support through TANF funds? What do other states do in
terms of fatherhood program funding?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>A.</b>&nbsp; In Virginia, the Division of Child Support
Enforcement (DCSE) partners with the Virginia Fatherhood Campaign (VFC)
through a Memorandum of Understanding between the two entities. DCSE grants
funds to VFC for the purpose of promoting responsible fatherhood throughout
the Commonwealth. VFC accomplishes this through seed grants to community
Fatherhood programs, workshops for service providers, media advertising,
printed materials and brochures for dissemination to the general public. DCSE
employs a Fatherhood Coordinator whose responsibilities include educating the
public about the child support program and fostering positive working
relationships between community Fatherhood programs and DCSE. DCSE district
offices are encouraged to collaborate with community Fatherhood programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In Virginia, TANF accounts for 100 percent of the funding
granted to VFC through the Memorandum of Understanding between DCSE and VFC.
In other states, TANF funds can and are used as well as combinations of TANF
and State General Funds.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Q.&nbsp; In his testimony, Ron Haskins raises the issue
that, as the welfare caseload declines, there are fewer potential child
support collections for parents on welfare. This, as you know, has
traditionally been a partial funding source for operating child support
programs  when States retain and share with the federal government
collections for parents on welfare. Aside from simply expecting the State or
federal governments to provide more funds to fill this gap, do you have any
other creative ideas for addressing this problem, which is likely to be with
us for a long term?</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2"><b>A.</b>&nbsp; There are no easy answers to the issue of
funding the child support program in the face of decreasing collections for
parents on welfare. A small piece of good news is that for the first time in
several years, these collections in Virginia did not decrease. The National
Council of Child Support Directors (NCCSD) recently conducted a survey of
child support directors to solicit funding ideas. Some thoughts included
increasing Federal Financial Participation (FFP) to 75 percent and eliminating
the state share of retained collections, developing creative ways to use TANF
block grant dollars to fund the child support program, and perhaps up-fronting
the federal share of program costs instead of reimbursing costs after the
fact. Any new concept will require additional analysis and study to assess the
impact. NCCSD encourages Congress to work with states, OCSE and professional
organizations to develop a viable funding structure to ensure adequate and
stable funding for this critical program. NCCSD recently developed a
resolution on funding for the child support program. The recommendations are
repeated here.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The federal Office of Child Support Enforcement,
Administration for Children and Families, Department of Health and Human
Services (OCSE) and Congress should provide for full and sustained Federal
Financial Participation (FFP) for all aspects of the Child Support Program at
current or enhanced levels.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Congress should ensure the continuation of 90 percentage FFP
for genetic testing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Congress should amend federal law to extend the use of 80
percent FFP to October 1, 2005, for enhancements to automated systems required
by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of
1996, including implementation of the medical support notice which is required
by federal regulations issued in March 2001.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">When states are required to implement new mandates, or make
substantial revisions to existing program requirements, Congress should
provide enhanced FFP to reduce the impact on the states child support
budgets.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">To ensure timely and consistent implementation of any of the
Medical Child Support Working Groups recommendations that require State
child support agencies to assume new responsibilities, Congress should provide
enhanced 90 percent FFP for medical support activities for a limited 5-year
period.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">OCSE and Congress should work with state IV-D Directors to
identify methods for ensuring that stable and adequate levels of investment in
the program by federal, state, and local governments advances the child
support programs evolving mission and improves outcomes. This investment
should reflect overall trends and future directions in the nations human
services delivery system rather than a point-in-time analysis, and adhere to a
set of principles that properly relate funding approaches to program needs,
goals and performance.</font></p>

information on your questions.</font></p>

<p>1. How do the fatherhood programs your organization operates interact with
the child support system? How do they treat the issue of marriage</b>?</p>
<p>Our fatherhood development programs interact with state and local child
support enforcement agencies on a win-win basis. The child support enforcement
agency and community-based fatherhood development program partnerships that
have been developed under various fatherhood initiatives are based on the
premise that the well-being of children is central to allmothers, fathers,
child support agencies, community-based organizations, other public and
private service agencies, and others concerned in the community. At the core
of the partnerships is the relationship between child support enforcement and
community-based organizations. The challenge for these partnerships is to
improve the trust and the relationships between child support enforcement and
community-based organizations necessary for the child support program to
exercise state flexibility provided under PRWORA. This must be done in a way
that is consistent with the states fiscal character.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this under the Partners for Fragile Families (PFF)
Demonstration Project, NPCL created a Peer Learning College that includes
child support enforcement representatives from a number of state child support
enforcement programs. The Peer Learning College provides a forum for child
support professionals to learn about the issues faced by low-income fathers
and by community-based fatherhood development programs designed to serve them
and find ways to interact with them and other public/private service agencies
attempting to serve low-income fathers and their fragile families. An
important part of the curriculum has been the participation of young fathers
and community-based fatherhood practitioners in all six sessions over the past
three years.</p>
<p>NPCL has also held extensive orientation and training for community-based
organizations around the workings of the child support system. Child support
partners from the PFF sites have served as instructors for many of these
sessions. NPCL has developed the expertise to coordinate the various agency
partnerships in serving low-income, low-skilled parents and their children.</p>
<p>NPCL has also invested in bringing considerable expertise, including
on-board staff, around the issue of child support to serve as a resource for
our community-based partners, and to enhance the capacity of our state child
support partners to work more effectively with community-based agencies.</p>
<p>All of these efforts have reinforced the interaction between the partners
and built a common level of understanding and trust. This understanding and
trust has served as a platform for the partners to negotiate systems and
manage the risks associated with the fathers habilitation and participation
in society.</p>

<p>How do they, our programs, treat the issue of marriage?</p>
</b>
<p>We instruct our programs that marriage is a special human relationship. We
are fortunate in having a number of men and women from the clergy associated
with our sites. As part of the training using the Fatherhood Development
Curriculum, the sites invite experts to come in and discuss the issues
surrounding marriage. When men proceed in fatherhood development programs and
express an interest in marriage, we advise program staff to refer them to
professionals in the field. These are often faith-based partners responsible
for the institutions where a large number of marriages occur. They take the
lead in this area. In our programs marriage is perceived as a success.</p>
<b>
<p>A. What impact has this interaction had on fathers, children, mothers,
financial status of fathers, and the emotional connection between fathers and
children?</p>
</b>
<p>In many cases it has transformed their lives. Our fatherhood development
programs have seen fathers at all levels of marginalization, alienated from
families and friends, and civil society. After enrollment in the programs,
fathers actually confront the many challenges to changing their lives and
reconnecting with their families and their children. Many have been able to
surmount the challenges, become financial contributors to their children,
establishing paternity and paying their child support, and most importantly,
emotionally attached and positively involved in the lives of their children.
Consequently, they enjoy recreational activities with their children,
participate in family outings and are engaged in their childs nurturing,
educational and developmental processes. Their emotional involvement has also
meant a singular reluctance to engage in activities that would place them in
jeopardy of returning to their previous status and placing their children at
risk.</p>
<p><b>2. How do programs work with noncustodial fathers to help them better
connect emotionally with their children and their childrens mothers</b>?</p>
<p>Our programs are designed to meet the multiple service needs of fathers.
Their operations are based on Fatherhood Development: A Curriculum for Young
Fathers. The curriculum was field-tested in Public/Private Ventures Young
Unwed Fathers Pilot Project (see attachment). Through a series of
approximately 25 streetwise discussions that provide support, information and
motivation in the areas of life skills, personal development, parenthood,
relationships, sexuality and responsible fatherhood, young fathers receive
assistance so necessary to their full participation in the lives of their
children. The programs are also designed to remove the social, legal,
economic, cultural, and institutional barriers to their involvement in
childrens lives.</p>
<b>
<p>What positive changes have you seen?</p>
</b>
<p>Across the PFF demonstration sites, we have seen several instances where
young men are assuming full responsibility for the direction of their lives.
In one site we have seen a young Hispanic father, recently out of jail, get
assistance from our program, get training and a job in asbestos removal. He is
currently making well above minimum wage. He is paying his child support, and
the mother of his child, who had disdained him when he was incarcerated, has
allowed him to see the child regularly and has even begun dating him again.
Since his involvement in the program, he stopped engaging in all at risk
behaviorsmoking, drinking, gang banging and selling drugs.</p>
<p>In another site, we had a young man who had been &quot;in the life&quot;
for many years, engaging in selling drugs and small-time thievery, and having
multiple children with the same young lady. Since his involvement in the
program he has ceased all at risk activities, secured a job, and has married
the mother of his children.</p>
<p>In still another site, a young man, recently out of high school, through
participation in the program has been intimately involved throughout the
pregnancy of his girl friend. He has been with her on visits to the pre-natal
clinics and on visits to the doctor, and is now talking about marrying the
mother of his child. The list is long across the PFF sites. We have many
success stories where young fathers, through the efforts of our programs, have
transformed themselves into contributing members of the communities and
wonderful fathers and role models for their children.</p>
<p><b>3. How do you bring the fathers who are &quot;living below the radar
screen, outside organized society and out of the child support enforcement
system&quot; into your programs?</p>
</b>
<p>When we refer to fathers &quot;living below the radar screen, outside
organized society and out of the reach of child support enforcement,&quot; we
are addressing that portion of the population that we call dead-broke dads.
These young men do not have attachment to the labor force. Moreover, many of
them participate in the underground economy. Further, many of the young
fathers we serve do not have a permanent address. They move from a relative to
a friend and then back to the relative with great frequency.</p>
<p>For purposes of child support enforcement, establishing legal notice is
difficult and often impossible. As a result of PRWORA however, the child
support enforcement system can move forward even when they have not
established traditional effective legal notice. This can lead to default
orders with imputed incomes that are inconsistent with the fathers ability
to pay. Arrears accumulate and with interest up to 18% added in some states,
child support debt can exceed a years wages. If these dads do find jobs and
are identified under the new hires reporting system, by the time child support
enforcement can serve an income withholding order, they have lost the job.</p>
<p>Our programs recruit through various sources. They include Head Start
programs, Alternative Schools serving young mothers, Healthy Start projects
and other programs that serve low-income mothers and children. However, the
best source of recruitment of these men is the mothers of their children and
often the fathers own mothers. And the best method of recruitment is getting
out into the community where the fathers are.</p>
<p>There, through word of mouth, street outreach, a need to find a job, the
tireless work of outreach workers, or the desperate desire to address a child
support arrearage, or because the mother of their child or their own mother
has encouraged them, these clients present themselves to programs. The word on
the street will be that this program can help you. It will not judge you. The
program is a place where, if you put in the time and effort, staff will assist
you in &quot;straightening out your life.&quot; This is the best recruitment.</p>
<p><b>4. In your testimony, you mentioned that &quot;the average mother on
welfare receives about $33 per month in covert support from poor
fathers.&quot; Please define &quot;covert support&quot; and tell us how you
arrived at the $33 figure.</p>
</b>
<p>Covert child support is money, purchases, or services provided to the
custodial parent by the noncustodial parent and are not reported to the child
support system.</p>
<p>The $33 figure comes from Poor Dads Who Dont pay Child Support:
Deadbeats or Disadvantaged?&quot; a study by Elaine Sorenson and Chava Zibman
of the Urban Institute, and based on Assessing the New Federalisms 1997
National Survey of Americas Families.</p>
<b>
<p>5. You seem to focus a lot on never-married fathers and their interactions
with the child support system. Can you tell us about efforts involving
divorced fathers and their willingness and ability to pay child support?</p>
</b>
<p>You are correct Mr. Chairman; the vast majority of our work deals with that
portion of the population that is low income, low skilled, and never married.
Young cohabiting couples produce <b>one-third of all</b> <b>of</b> Americas
children. That is not one-third of all poor children, one-third of all
minority children, or one-third of any sub grouping that you might name. It is
a fact that one third of all American children are the progeny of couples that
have never been married. In addition, about a quarter of all poor children are
produced by couples who are either cohabiting or couples in which the father
visits the child at least once per week. These visiting relationships tend to
be an important part of the parenting/living arrangements of young African
American families, while childbearing within cohabitation is more typical of
white and Hispanic couples.</p>
<p>The Partners for Fragile Families Demonstration was built on the lessons
learned from 25 years of publicly and privately supported demonstrations in
the field of responsible fatherhood, including the Teen Fathers
Collaboration, the Young Unwed Fathers Pilot Project, and the Parents Fair
Share Demonstration Project. PFF was designed to augment our research by
gathering first party information on the nature and substance of the
relationships that exist in what we call fragile families. We started first
with research to determine if these fathers fit the bad guy image, and if
these children were the result of casual relationships, as we so often heard.</p>
<p>This population was chosen because we had consistently heard from the
mothers of these children that these guys werent bad guys, just broke. We
also had heard that interaction with the child support system was a nightmare
for this population. We wanted to know if specific interventions moved these
couples in the direction of more traditional family formation. Could a better
working relationship with the child support system serve not to place
additional strain on the relationship?</p>
<p>Moreover, we focused on this population because it is the fastest growing
family type in which poor children reside, and in many ways constitutes a new
pathway into child poverty; replacing the old, namely divorce and separation
of a previously non-poor, married couple household. As we move into the
future, we can expect children born to fragile families to represent an
increasing share of all poor children and children born to previously non-poor
married couples, which later divorced leaving the mother and child alone and
poor, to constitute a diminishing share of all poor children. This latter
portion will simply age out of the population of poor children.</p>
<p>Finally, we emphasized this population because it is the population where
our current welfare and child support systems are having the least success in
reducing child poverty and improving child well-being, even though these
systems encounter (and will continue to encounter) more and more of the
children from this population every day.</p>
<p>I would say, Mr. Chairman that there are significant differences between
the way divorced fathers and fathers in fragile families interact with
families, welfare and child support systems. First, divorced fathers tend to
be older and have older children. As a result, they are more experienced in
the labor market and their relationships with the mothers of their children
are more deteriorated. Because they have more labor market experience than
fathers in fragile families, it is difficult for our current workforce
development systems to boost their wages above what they could already earn on
their own. Demonstration projects which have focused on divorced fathers have
been unable to improve the employment and earnings of these fathers and
therefore unable to raise the level of the child support payments they are
making. This frustrates efforts made by child support authorities to
accommodate the labor market barriers these fathers face, in attempting to
fulfill their responsibilities to families and taxpayers. Moreover, because
these fathers are older, have older children, and older cases in the child
support system, many are in arrears, and this further complicates the efforts
of child support enforcement to work in a progressive way with these fathers.
Finally, because their relationships with the mothers of their children have
long since deteriorated, the prospects of getting the mothers cooperation
in involving the father in the life of the child is diminished. Therefore,
public investments with low-income divorced fathers will yield less in terms
of the improved financial and emotional well-being of children.</p>
<p>All this argues for focusing our efforts on young, fragile families, whose
educational skills, employment experiences, and family relationships are still
in the process of development and still subject to positive redirection.
Moreover, previous demonstrations have shown greater success in improving the
employment and earnings of these fathers, and that they are less likely to
have already accumulated large amounts of arrears, so that child support
enforcement administrators face fewer obstacles in trying to accommodate the
employment barriers these fathers face. PFF hopes to build upon this
experience by examining a variety of locally based strategies to further
improve their employment and earnings and by making an improved relationship
between the young parents an explicit goal of our work.</p>
<b>
<p>6. The first attachment to your testimony (&quot;NPCL Peer Learning
College,&quot; Page 3) discusses &quot;significant barriers to timely
modifications (of arrears for low-income noncustodial parents) during periods
of reduced ability to pay.&quot; What do you mean by these &quot;
barriers?&quot; How might those be addressed?</p>
</b>
<p>Principal among the significant barriers is the fact that most child
support programs are severely under-funded. The capacity of the child support
system is insufficient to handle the caseload. Therefore it is perfectly
logical that CSE programs would work on the higher priority items reflected in
the new child support incentive measures.</p>
<p>Another significant barrier is that in the majority of our states
guidelines provisions are out dated. This means that even in states that have
a self-support reserve, the reserve may have been set in 1984 dollars and not
updated to take into account the inflationary impact of the last two decades.</p>
<p>The general public- including our target population- does not know the
processes and procedures by which one would obtain a modification. Downward
modification, particularly from a default order may require an attorney. While
a number of law schools have long proud histories of working with low-income
moms, very few work with low-income dads.</p>
<p>Finally, many state legislators do not know their level of flexibility in
setting child support guidelines. Instead, many believe that the federal
partner mandated the exact scheme that is in their state law, which is not the
case.</p>

<p>The Honorable Wally Herger<br>
2268 Rayburn House Office Building<br>
Washington, DC 20515</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5; margin-left: -1">Dear Chairman Herger:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for inviting me to testify before your
Subcommittee about child support and fatherhood. It was a great privilege to
appear before your Subcommittee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This letter is a response to the questions posed in your
letter of June 29.</p>
<ol>
  <li>With regard to the fatherhood programs outlined in legislation such as
    H.R. 1471, what do you think will be the most positive effects of these
    programs on the communities where they are implemented? Do we have
    evidence about positive changes seen to date?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, with regard to the anticipated positive effects
of fatherhood programs, I think it is necessary to be humble about what can be
achieved in the short run. There are numerous fatherhood programs throughout
the nation, but very few have been the subject of scientific evaluations. Many
of these programs are aimed at helping divorced fathers deal with issues of
custody and visitation and learning how to be better fathers when they cannot
reside with their own children.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, based on the direction
the Subcommittee has taken in recent years, as well as legislation enacted by
the House last year, I believe that the major interest of Congress is in
programs designed primarily to help poor and low-income fathers. The
legislation enacted by the House last year attempted to promote programs that
would help poor fathers improve their employment prospects, become better
parents, and work toward marriage. There are far fewer programs of this sort,
and again very few good evaluations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, in large part because of actions taken by the
Human Resources Subcommittee way back in 1988, the Manpower Demonstration
Research Corporation (MDRC) has conducted a rigorous experiment on the effects
of a particular type of fatherhood program for poor fathers called
&quot;Parents Fair Share.&quot; The Parents Fair Share programs, which
enrolled about 5,600 fathers in seven cities, involved peer discussion groups,
employment and training services, and child support services; the goals of the
programs were to increase child support payments, improve the fathers
employment and earnings, and increase the fathers involvement with their
children. The MDRC research, which is the best information available on the
impacts of programs for low-income fathers, operated in the seven cities
between 1994 and 1996. MDRC has now published several excellent reports on the
results. Unfortunately, the results are decidedly mixed. There is little
evidence of increased employment or increased contact with children, but some
evidence of an increase in the number of fathers who paid child support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were the first major programs that attempted to
help poor fathers be better providers and better parents. The history of
innovative social programs is one of major failures</font> <font size="2">and
minor successes. Thus, the key to success is to keep trying, as the nation did
with welfare-to-work programs. Although the first generation of programs for
poor fathers produced only modest positive outcomes, they did show that poor
fathers were willing participants and that the overwhelming majority of poor
fathers indicated that they wanted to do a much better job of having contact
with children and providing support for them. The fact that more poor fathers
paid child support is consistent with this conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it would be wrong to assert that fatherhood
programs, based on the knowledge currently at hand, can be expected to have
major impacts on parenting, employment, or marriage in the short run. However,
the results from the first round of programs is not entirely discouraging. In
fact, I believe that future programs may be able to produce better results,
especially if they begin around the time that unmarried parents have their
first child. A few programs of this type are now being designed. I believe, as
do many researchers familiar with previous and current programs, that programs
focused on helping these young couples, about half of whom cohabit and well
over 80 percent of whom tell interviewers they are in serious, committed
relationships, could produce much better outcomes that the first round of
programs evaluated by MDRC.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>States can use their TANF or even Social Services Block Grant funds to
    operate fatherhood programs? Just from Federal and State TANF funds, thats
    a potential pool of about $26 billion per year for running such programs,
    along with all the other cash welfare programs States run. Do we know how
    many States are using TANF funds for fatherhood programs? What do we know
    about the results?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In your letter you also asked about whether states are
now using their TANF dollars to support programs for poor fathers. Here are
two answers. First, based on talks with state officials and staff members with
national organizations that represent state government, many states are using
some TANF dollars to mount programs for poor fathers. However, as far as I
have been able to find out, there is no formal survey of these programs, let
alone any kind of rigorous evaluation. But as your letter implies, there is no
question that states could use their TANF money to design and implement
programs for poor fathers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Welfare-to-Work program, which is also under
the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, supports many fatherhood
programs. A recent report by Shannon Harper and Christine Devere of the
Congressional Research Service found a total of 77 such programs. To my
knowledge these programs have not been evaluated and we now have little
information on whether they have been successful. It is my understanding that
the Department of Labor has worked hard to encourage fatherhood programs to
apply for the Welfare-to-Work funds and that they are collecting basic
administrative data on these programs. It may occur to you that the
Congressional Research Service could summarize what is known about these
programs from administrative data. However, I doubt that the available
information would provide reliable data on whether these programs have had
impacts on fathers employment, earnings, payment of child support, or
marriage. Information of this type requires random-assignment experiments,
like the Parents Fair Share study conducted by MDRC, and as far as I have
been able to discover no such studies of the Department of Labor programs are
underway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having worked in this field for several years, I believe
there is growing recognition that fathers are critical to adequate child
development, that two-parent married families provide the best rearing
environment for children, and that the nation has entirely too many
single-parent families. But recent research shows that poor fathers have
serious problems in American society: they have high unemployment and low
earnings rates; they have high crime, arrest, and incarceration rates; and
they have difficulty establishing lasting relationships with their children or
their childrens mother. It would be a public service of huge proportions if
Congress could provide the resources and overall framework for programs that
would help poor fathers avoid crime, improve employment, improve parenting
frequency and skill, and work toward marriage. In my opinion, the legislation
reported out of the Ways and Means Committee and passed by the House (but not
the Senate) last year would, if enacted this year, be a major step in the
right direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks again for the opportunity to provide information
on child support and fatherhood to the Human Resources Subcommittee. In
addition to this letter, MDRC has graciously agreed to send a complete set of
their studies of the Parents Fair Share evaluation to your Subcommittee
staff director Matt Weidinger. I am happy to respond to additional questions
you or your staff might have.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">The Honorable</font><font size="2"> Wally
Herger, Chairman<br>
Subcommittee on Human Resources<br>
House Committee on Ways and Means</font></p>
<p><font size="2">I appreciate this opportunity to respond to the additional
questions posed by the Subcommittee following the hearing on June 28, 2001.</font></p>
<font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Some Members may believe that giving
more child support money to families on welfare will make it easier for them
to stay on welfare, rather than encouraging them to move off of welfare. How
would you respond to these Members?</i></font>
<p><font size="2">With the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), welfare became a time-limited
program.<a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a> Giving more child support to
families while they are on welfare helps them to get this important source of
income in place before they leave welfare, furthering PRWORA's goal of making
welfare a transitional assistance program. Wisconsin's experimental policy of
passing through all child support to families receiving Temporary Assistance
for Needy Families (TANF), and disregarding all of it in determining the TANF
grant, has been demonstrated not to increase welfare stays. On the contrary,
Wisconsin's full pass-through and disregard, as compared to a more limited
pass-through policy, has stimulated an increase in child support payments that
has enabled families to leave welfare more quickly, and provided additional
income that can help them avoid a return to welfare.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">To transform their welfare programs into programs of
transitional assistance, most states have adopted policies to encourage
families receiving TANF to develop the sources of income they will need when
they leave TANF. Given the flexibility to develop their own policies
concerning disregards for earned income, all but five states have adopted
earnings disregards more generous than those that existed under the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.<a href="#N_2_"><sup> (2)</sup></a>
Although these policies also, in theory, could make it easier to stay on
welfare, they have coincided with an increase in work participation and a
dramatic decline in the welfare rolls. In addition, programs that increased
family income as well as parental employment were found to produce
improvements in child well-being that were not matched by programs that
increased parental employment alone; and, the positive effects of earnings
supplement programs on children were most pronounced for the children of
long-term welfare recipients.<a href="#N_3_"><sup> (3)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">States have had less flexibility to experiment with giving
more child support to families because of the requirement that they repay the
federal share of all child support collections for children receiving TANF.
Wisconsin, however, was able to pursue a full pass-through and disregard
policy as part of its &quot;W-2&quot; program under a federal waiver it
received before the passage of PRWORA. In this experiment, for most custodial
parents receiving cash assistance, all child support paid was passed through
to the family and disregarded in calculating their grant. A randomly assigned
control group received only a partial pass-through and disregard of child
support.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Wisconsin's full pass-through and disregard policy was found
to increase significantly the percentage of noncustodial parents who paid
support and the amount of support paid.<a href="#N_4_"><sup> (4)</sup></a> The
effects were particularly strong among parents of children without a history
of AFDC receipt, because they did not have expectations based on the old
system, in which payments went to reimburse welfare costs.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>
(5)</sup></a> Connecticut tested a more limited pass-through and disregard
policy. In its &quot;Jobs First&quot; program, all child support was passed
through and the disregard was increased from $50 to $100. Average child
support payments for &quot;Jobs First&quot; participants were found to be
higher than for the control group subject to AFDC rules.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>
(6)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Under Wisconsin's full pass-through and disregard policy,
mothers received more child support than under the old rules, in part because
of the increase in child support paid and in part because they were allowed to
receive more child support income. However, refuting the concerns that some
Members may have that such a policy would increase welfare stays, the
researchers found that:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">receiving child support is associated with an increased
  likelihood of moving to an upper tier [in which families receive supportive
  services but not cash] or off the program by the end of the first year.
  Thus, to the extent that the reform increases support, it may also decrease
  W-2 participation.<a href="#N_7_"><sup> (7)</sup></a></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2">In addition, researchers found that the Wisconsin policy
produced no difference in overall government costs, because cost savings in
other programs offset the child support payments that were given to families
instead of retained.<a href="#N_8_"><sup> (8)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Receipt of child support also reduces the length of time a
family receives welfare by helping families avoid a return to welfare and
increasing their well-being.<a href="#N_9_"><sup> (9)</sup></a> Analysis of
national data found that women receiving any amount of support are less likely
to return to welfare; that support received by a young woman in the first
years of a child's life is positively related to her later self-sufficiency;
and that women who received support in each of the first five years after
exiting welfare were among those who achieved modest levels of economic
well-being.<a href="#N_10_"><sup> (10)</sup></a> A study in Washington State
found that good child support payments were associated with lower recidivism
rates, which substantially increased time off of welfare.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>
(11)</sup></a> An analysis in Texas found that for every $100 in child support
received per quarter by a caretaker who left AFDC, the probability of welfare
recidivism in that quarter was reduced by one percentage point, and the
receipt of child support had over a three times larger effect on recidivism
than an equivalent dollar amount of the caretaker's own earnings.<a
href="#N_12_"><sup> (12)</sup></a> After reviewing all of the available
research, the 1999 Report to Congress on child support and welfare recidivism
concluded:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">Based on research findings, even small amounts of child
  support payments reduce welfare recidivism ... As the residual [TANF]
  caseload decreases over time, it increasingly comprises hard-to-place
  individuals who face substantial barriers to employment. ...[T]he relative
  value of even incremental increases in child support will be greater for the
  hard to place. Additionally, if these individuals reside in a low-benefit
  State, the relative replacement value for the TANF grant will be greater.
  This combination of factors suggests that PRWORA distribution policies that
  increase child support payments to these families may have an even greater
  effect on welfare exits.<a href="#N_13_"><sup> (13)</sup></a></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Congress has recognized the importance of giving more child
support to families that have left welfare. PRWORA gave families leaving TANF
greater claims to their past-due child support than they had under AFDC. This
Subcommittee is considering H.R. 1471, which would eliminate remaining
exceptions to &quot;Family First&quot; distribution for families that have
left TANF. The changes to the post-TANF assignment and distribution rules in
H.R. 1471 certainly would increase the amount of child support that families
leaving TANF receive, and would help them avoid a return to welfare. However,
changes that also would make it feasible for states to change the distribution
rules for families while they are on welfare could produce additional
increases in the amount and timeliness of the child support that families
receive when they leave welfare for two reasons.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">First, if child support payments were passed through to
families while they were on welfare, there would be no disruption in payments
when they left welfare. Although families are legally entitled to receive
current support payments after they leave welfare, in practice there have been
delays of several months in some states in redirecting payments from the state
to the family.<a href="#N_14_"><sup> (14)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Second, the incentive effects on support payments are likely
to be greater if states are able to change the mission and message of the
child support program in a more comprehensive way. As noted above, Wisconsin
had a harder time explaining the new policy to families that had experienced
the old system, and the increases in payments, although they occurred, were
lower among prior recipients than among those new to the system. This suggests
that the incentive effect would be greater if states could give parents a
simple, consistent message: than whenever noncustodial parents pay support,
whether their children are receiving assistance at the time or not, those
payments directly increase their children's well-being. This would complement
the efforts of programs working with low-income fathers to encourage and help
them to provide more economic and emotional support to their children.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In sum, the evidence shows that giving more child support to
families on welfare will make the child support program a more effective tool
for promoting self sufficiency. At a minimum, federal policy should eliminate
the barriers to states' adopting such policies.</font></p>
<em><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In general, what are State policies
toward passing through child support to families while they are receiving TANF
benefits? How many States do you think would change their policy if H.R. 1471
were enacted into law?</font></em>
<p><font size="2">As of January 1999, the latest date for which complete
state-by-state information is available, slightly more than half the states
(28, including the District of Columbia) did not pass through and disregard
child support to families receiving TANF. Eighteen states passed through and
disregarded child support up to various amounts: $50 per month (15 states),
$40 (1 state), $75 (1 state), $100 (1 state). One state passed through and
disregarded <em>all</em> child support for TANF recipients. Four states had
policies other than a pass-through and disregard that permit TANF recipients
to benefit from child support paid on their behalf. One of the four retained
child support payments, but increased the TANF grant by up to $50 per month
for those on whose behalf current support is collected. (This has the same
effect on family income as a $50 pass-through and disregard, but is
administered differently.) Three of the four had no specific child support
disregard, but allowed recipients to use other income, including child
support, to &quot;fill the gap&quot; between the state's maximum benefit and
the income eligibility standard. If the earnings of a family receiving TANF
did not fill the gap, child support income would be disregarded. (Two states
with a $50 pass-through and disregard also had fill-the-gap policies.)<a
href="#N_15_"><sup> (15)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Congressional Budget Office estimates, based on
conversations with state representatives, that if federal law were changed to
eliminate the requirement that states reimburse the federal share of child
support collections passed through and disregarded for TANF families, about
half the states that do not currently have a $50 pass-through and disregard
would adopt such a policy (about 14 states). In addition, 10 to 20 percent of
states that have a $50 pass-through and disregard would increase it (two to
three states).<a href="#N_16_"><sup> (16)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">I know of no other estimates of the number of states that
would change their policies in response to the legislation. However,
organizations representing states have expressed both considerable interest in
experimenting in this area and concerns about fiscal impacts in some states,<a
href="#N_17_"><sup> (17)</sup></a> suggesting that state responses will vary.</font></p>
<p><em><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Please expand on the importance of
requiring review and modification of child support orders for TANF recipients
every three years and for reviewing the child support cases of families
leaving TANF.</font></em></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Making an extra effort to ensure that families
leaving TANF receive appropriate child support and medical support would
benefit families and reduce returns to welfare (see research cited in response
to question 1, above). Unfortunately, few IV-D agencies are systematically
undertaking such an effort. Requiring that IV-D agencies conduct a full review
of the cases of families leaving TANF would ensure that states make a priority
of improving services to this vulnerable population.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Under PRWORA, periodic reviews of child support
orders are no longer required in TANF cases. States are supposed to notify all
parents, TANF and non-TANF, custodial and noncustodial, every three years, of
their right to request a review of their order. However, a 1999 review of
state policies and practices in this area by the Office of Inspector General
of the Department of Health and Human Services found that 18 states did not
notify parents of their right to request a review, and nine had no plans to do
so, despite the requirements of federal law. No state used proactive measures
to promote review requests from parents close to exiting public assistance.
And, although all states reported that it was their policy to check for and
add medical support to orders they reviewed, in seven of the ten states
visited by the OIG, the IV-D staff interviewed said that they did not always
pursue medical support if the order did not otherwise require adjustment.<a
href="#N_18_"><sup> (18)</sup></a> Without adequate notice to parents,
including the financial information parents need to make an informed decision
about whether to request a review, the current &quot;on-request&quot; review
and modification system will not ensure that orders reflect the changing
circumstances of parents and children.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Requiring that IV-D offices conduct a full case review for
families leaving TANF and take additional actions, if appropriate, to locate
noncustodial parents, establish paternity and support awards, review and
modify awards, and collect support, could produce significant increases in
child support. In 1999, only 24 percent of current assistance cases had
collections as compared to 42 percent of never-assistance cases.<a
href="#N_19_"><sup> (19)</sup></a> The main reason for the difference was that
fewer current assistance cases had orders: 44 percent as compared to 64
percent of never-assistance cases. Once an order was established, the
difference in collection rates was smaller; 56 percent of current assistance
cases with orders had collections, as compared to 66 percent of
never-assistance cases.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Intensively working the cases of parents who are about to
leave welfare will require additional resources -- but can produce results. In
Minnesota, for example, several years ago the state legislature offered
performance bonuses to counties for establishing paternities, reviewing
orders, and enrolling children in the noncustodial parent's insurance plan.
Hennepin County substantially increased its staffing in those areas -- and
increased the number of paternities established each month by 40 percent,
conducted four times as many modification reviews, and increased threefold the
number of children enrolled in the noncustodial parent's medical insurance
plan. Moreover, results were obtained even in the older AFDC cases.</font></p>
<ol start="3">
  <p><font size="2">&quot;[C]lients are now better prepared for
  self-sufficiency because more cases have orders and older orders now have
  higher amounts. We were much better prepared for welfare reform than we
  would have been without this program.&quot;<a href="#N_20_"><sup> (20)</sup></a></font></p>

<ol start="3">
  <p><em><font size="2">&quot;...arrears will remain high unless child support
  agencies enter realistic orders in low-income cases, compromise
  uncollectible arrears, and work cooperatively with community-based
  organizations and state agencies that can help noncustodial parents overcome
  the underlying problems that prevent them from getting and keeping the kinds
  of jobs needed to support their children.&quot;</font></em></p>
  <p><em><font size="2">Would you agree with his statement? What does it take
  to, for example, &quot;compromise uncollectible arrears?&quot;</font></em></p>
</ol>
<p><font size="2">I would agree generally with the statement, but emphasize
that it refers to low-income obligors and to arrears owed to the state, not to
custodial parents. Some arrearages accumulate because noncustodial parents
with the ability to pay have avoided paying child support; however, those
noncustodial parents and those arrearages are not the subject of Dr. Johnson's
testimony, or this response.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The large arrearages that many low-income noncustodial
parents owe to the state are a problem not only for them, but for custodial
parents and children, as representatives of both groups explained in the
&quot;Common Ground&quot; project of the National Women's Law Center and the
Center on Fathers, Families, and Public Policy.<a href="#N_21_"><sup> (21)</sup></a>
Many states pursue a variety of policies that create particularly high arrears
for the low-income parents of children receiving public assistance. For
example, the vast majority of states order noncustodial parents to pay
retroactive support in public assistance cases, and a few order parents to
reimburse Medicaid birthing costs, creating large debts to the state as soon
as an order to pay support is entered. Orders may be entered that are
unrelated to ability to pay; some states set a high percentage of their orders
by default, and set the amount of the award by imputing income when the
obligor's income or earning capacity is unknown. In the case of low-income
obligors who have very low and sporadic earnings, these imputed orders may far
exceed the obligors' ability to pay. Or, awards that are realistic when
entered may be difficult or impossible to modify when circumstances change.<a
href="#N_22_"><sup> (22)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Policies that create huge arrearages for low-income
noncustodial parents make it less likely that these parents will make current
support payments. The Inspector General found that noncustodial parents who
were charged for more than 12 months of retroactive support were two and a
half times more likely to make no support payments following the establishment
of an order than noncustodial parents who were not charged retroactive
support.<a href="#N_23_"><sup> (23)</sup></a> Noncustodial parents that owe
large arrearages, and face the prospect of having up to 65 percent of their
wages garnished indefinitely for repayment of the debt, may quit their jobs,
move, or join the underground economy, which is already an important source of
income for some.<a href="#N_24_"><sup> (24)</sup></a> Programs that work with
low-income noncustodial fathers have found arrearage policies, along with
policies that give current support payments to the state instead of to their
children, to be major barriers to recruiting participants and encouraging them
to participate in the formal child support system.<a href="#N_25_"><sup> (25)</sup></a>
Thus, harsh and unrealistic arrearage policies can deprive children of badly
needed support, and ultimately increase public costs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In addition to developing policies that prevent the build-up
of arrearages, some states have begun to consider compromising arrears owed to
the state. Under federal law, a child support obligation becomes a final
judgment when it comes due and cannot be retroactively modified. 42 U.S.C. 
666(a)(9). However, as with other judgments, the individual or entity to whom
the child support judgment is owed may agree to a compromise. Thus, states
already have the ability to compromise arrearages permanently assigned to the
state.<a href="#N_26_"><sup> (26)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">States can consider a variety of factors in determining when
and how they will compromise arrearages owed to the state. For example, the
state could consider the source of the arrearage. Was it the result of an
on-going failure to pay a support order by someone with the ability to pay? If
so, compromise might be rejected. Or did it arise all at once, as retroactive
support or for Medicaid reimbursement? Was the order, when set, based on
unrealistic assumptions about the obligor's ability to pay? Did the arrearage
accumulate while the obligor was unemployed, incapacitated, or incarcerated?
States also could link forgiveness of the debt to current behavior; for
example, tying adjustments to payment of current support or participation in a
program. States also might treat forgiveness of interest or fees differently
from forgiveness of the obligation, or limit forgiveness policies to
low-income obligors.<a href="#N_27_"><sup> (27)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Principled policies allowing the compromise of arrearages
owed to the state are consistent with the message of parental responsibility
that the child support program seeks to convey. They recognize that some debts
to the state are not only uncollectible today, but may have been unrealistic
from the beginning, and that securing parental support for children should
take precedence over cost recovery.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. <em>In his testimony, Ron Haskins
raises the issue that, as the welfare caseload declines, there are fewer
potential child support collections for parents on welfare. This has been a
partial funding source for operating child support programs. Aside from simply
expecting the State or Federal governments to provide more funds to fill this
gap, can you offer us any other creative ideas for addressing this problem,
which is likely to be with us for the long term?</em></font></p>
<p><font size="2">I would emphasize to the Subcommittee that the financing gap
that is projected in the child support program is the result of declining
welfare caseloads; state child support agencies have increased their
collections per welfare case. If federal and state welfare policies are to
continue to emphasize family self-sufficiency, with only transitional use of
public assistance, then state and federal governments must be prepared to
provide adequate and stable financing for the child support program to help
families become self-sufficient and enforce the legal responsibility of
parents to support their children.<a href="#N_28_"><sup> (28)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">There is no easy alternative. Attempting to finance the
child support system by charging families for the child support services they
receive will not provide the child support enforcement system with a stable
source of financing and would significantly harm the low and moderate income
families who depend on the IV-D system. Over 75 percent of the families served
by the IV-D program have incomes below 250% of poverty. <a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
They can ill afford to lose part of their child support income. Agencies might
consider charging fees only to higher income families; but the small amount
that could be collected from this small group of families would hardly justify
the administrative expense.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">It is for these reasons that few states make significant use
of fees against voluntary users of the IV-D system. According to a report on
the financing of the IV-D system done for the Department of Health and Human
Services, child support fees collected from parents represented only two
percent of the funds states use to finance their child support programs. And,
although when the study was conducted state and federal governments were
already aware that falling welfare caseloads would mean falling welfare
collections, it also found that most states were not contemplating making
greater use of fees.<a href="#N_30_"><sup> (30)</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Some have suggested that fees could be paid by noncustodial
parents instead of deducted from support. In the end, this approach also is
likely to result in lower child support payments, especially for low-income
families. Excessive fees could discourage parents from paying through the
formal system, increase administrative costs as cases moved in and out of the
IV-D system, and increase tensions between custodial and noncustodial parents.
Child support awards could be reduced to adjust for the amount being charged
in fees. Finally, for low-income noncustodial parents, assessing large fees
could simply increase uncollectible arrearages, and ultimately reduce the
amount of child support paid.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Ensuring that children receive support from both parents by
enforcing support obligations and helping low-income parents to provide
support is a vital public function. Effective child support enforcement not
only increases family income and reduces reliance on public assistance, but is
linked to reductions in divorce and nonmarital birth rates,<a href="#N_31_"><sup>
(31)</sup></a> and to increases in children's educational attainment.<a
href="#N_32_"><sup> (32)</sup></a> Moreover, child support enforcement is a
function that must be performed and financed jointly by the state and federal
governments.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">There are a number of important financing questions to
consider: how much of the funding should come through incentive payments and
how much through matching funds; whether the incentive system could work more
effectively if the pool of funds was not capped; when states should be able to
use TANF or TANF MOE funds for functions related to child support. However,
the focus should be on restructuring public financing. Low-income families
that are struggling to support themselves without public assistance should not
be expected to continue to bear the burden of financing the child support
enforcement program.</font></p>
