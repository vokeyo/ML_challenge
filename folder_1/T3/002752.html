Undercooling Behavior of Immiscible Metal Alloys in the Absence of Container-Induced
Wetting and Nucleation</H2>

<HR>When an immiscible alloy is cooled, it will separate from a single
solution into a mixture of the lighter component lying on top of the heavier
one. This is very similar to a mixture of vinegar and oil at room temperature
in which the two components separate from each other after having been
shook into a near single solution. The difference between the alloy and
the salad dressing, besides the materials, is that the latter is already
below the temperature at which the separation process occurs spontaneously.
Thus, all the shaking you want to perform will only break the droplets
into smaller droplets, but will not break-up the droplets to the size of
an atom which is required to have a solution mixture. However, as an immiscible
alloy metal is cooled, it reaches the (consolute) temperature where the
atoms begin to glob together to form droplets. If the mixture is in a container,
the droplets will form at the container walls whereupon gravity will pull
the denser droplets to the bottom or allow the less-denser drops to float
to the top. Without gravity, the droplets will only move when other, less
severe forces act upon them such as thermal or density gradients. The lack
of gravity could cause a more uniform distribution of the droplets and
thus provide unique properties to the alloy after it solidifies.

<P>&nbsp;Another interesting phenomena in fluid physics is the <B><A HREF="http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/msad/dtf/under1.htm">undercooling</A></B>
of liquids. This is the lowering of the temperature of a liquid beyond
the freezing temperature and still maintaining a liquid form. Normal freezing
occurs when the atoms of the container walls impose an ordering on the
liquid atoms causing them to arrange themselves into a crystalline structure
and begin to grow. Without the container, the onset of freezing (called
nucleation) has a good chance of not happening. But, at some lower temperature
nucleation will occur and very rapid freezing takes place (called recalescence).
One question that arises when undercooling is considered with immisicibles
is what happens if there were no container? Would the droplets still form
at the surface? Even if they did, would the kinetics of the whole separation
process be the same as in a container? In particular, would the undercooling
phenomena still occur and would it be independent of whether the "vinegar
or the oil" came to the surface first?

<P>&nbsp;Previous tests of classical nucleation theory applied to liquid-liquid
gap miscibility systems found a discrepancy between experiment and theory
in the ability to undercool either of the liquids before the L1-L2 separated
[1,2].&nbsp;&nbsp; To model this initial separation process, free-energy
gradient [3] and density gradient [4] theories have been put forth.&nbsp;
If there is a large enough interaction between the critical liquid and
the crucible, both models predict a wetting temperature (Tw) above which
the minority liquid perfectly wets and forms layers at the crucible interface,
but only on one side of the immiscibility dome.&nbsp; Materials with compositions
on the other side of the dome will have simple surface adsorption by the
minority liquid before bulk separation occurs when the coexistence line
is reached.&nbsp; If the interaction between the critical liquid and the
crucible were to decrease, Tw would increase, eventually approaching the
critical consolute temperature (Tcc).&nbsp; At this point, large composition
ranges would exist in which non-perfect wetting conditions prevail, resulting
in undercooling of the phase-separation transition across the miscibility
gap.&nbsp; The contra-positive of this argument has recently been demonstrated
in a metastable immiscible system [5] using different oxide layers as crucibles.
The bulk fluid flows and resulting microstructure will then depend on what
has happened at the surface and the subsequent processing conditions.

<P>&nbsp;In the past several decades, many experiments in space [6-8] have
been performed on liquid metal binary immiscible systems for the purpose
of determining the effects that crucibles of different materials may have
on the wetting and separation process of the liquids.&nbsp; Several other
studies have been performed on immiscibles in a semi-container environment
using an emulsion technique [9,10]. Only one previous study on stable immiscible
systems was performed using a completely containerless processing technique
[11] and the results of that investigation are similar to the emulsion
studies.&nbsp; In all cases, surface wetting was attributed as the cause
for the similar microstructures or the asymmetry in the ability to undercool
the liquid below the binoidal on one side of the immiscibility dome.

<P>&nbsp;By removing the container completely, the loss of the crucible/liquid
interaction should produce a large shift in Tw and thus change the wetting
characteristics at the surface.&nbsp; By investigating various compositions
across the miscibility gap, a change in the liquid wetting potential at
the surface of a containerless droplet should change the nucleating behavior
of the droplet – whether it be the first order transition of liquid-liquid
surface wetting or of bulk liquid-to-solid. Either of these transitions
will change the undercooling capability and the subsequent degree of rapid
solidification that occurs before the separation of the two liquid phases
proceeds to completion.&nbsp; Containerless processing eliminates external
nucleants allowing the undercooling of the non-perfect wetting single-phase
liquid into the metastable region which may produce significant differences
in the separation process and the microstructure upon solidification.&nbsp;
An additional benefit of containerless processing is the removal of a large
source of contamination that a container provides for these reactive materials.&nbsp;
In this study, we attempt to determine the amount of undercooling that
either the liquid-liquid or liquid-solid transitions undergo by monitoring
the temperature of the sample with optical pyrometry.&nbsp; Another purpose
of this study is to examine the effects of weightlessness on the separation
process of the immiscible liquids.&nbsp; Microstructural analysis will
correlate the degree of undercooling and the separation mechanisms involved.

<P>&nbsp;The first objective of this project is to find a high temperatue
(HT) immiscible binary system that has (1) a monotectic temperature (the
temperature where one of the two liquids freezes) above 1000C, (2) a low
vapor pressure, (3) a wide miscibility gap (i.e., concentration range in
which liquid-liquid separation occurs), (4) low oxygen affinity, (5) available
thermophysical properties, and (6) an experimentally verifiable phase diagram.
Most of these conditions were found to be mutually exclusive from each
other: HT immiscibles which have high consolute temperatures do not have
low vapor pressures; the HT immiscibles that did have low vapor pressures
had very high oxygen affinities (i.e., rare earth elements); experimentally
determined phase diagrams were not readily available - only theoretically
calculated diagrams. The necessity of a HT system is due to the short free
fall cooling time (4.6 seconds) provided by the <B><A HREF="http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/msad/dtf/tube.htm">MSFC
Drop Tube Facility.</A></B>

<P>Electromagnetic levitation was used as the processing technique in the
Drop Tube Facility. The figure below shows the arrangement of the coil
and sample carousel.&nbsp; Initial processing of these alloys was not successful.
Upon melting, they immediately began to vaporize creating a plume which
coated and blocked the pyrometer viewport, or arced the levitation coil
if processed in a vacuum.
<BR><IMG SRC="em1s.gif" HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=114 WIDTH=150>Besides
the detremental effects of rapid concentration changes, the vaporization
also effects the surface wetting kinetics, nucleation, etc.&nbsp; In an
attempt to reduce the vaporization problem the Ti-Ce system was used.

<P>&nbsp;Cerium is a rare earth metal with an equilibrium oxygen partial
pressure of less than 10-30 atmospheres at 1000K and even smaller value
at room temperature. Conversations with the Rare-Earth Information Center
also suggested that just a small addition of oxygen (~500 ppm) into the
binary system could eliminate the immiscibility of the phase diagram. The
Ti-Ce droplet starting material was created using the same techniques as
with the previous systems. Great care was taken to use a glovebox and to
keep the Cerium and alloys under ethanol to prevent oxidation. These alloys
did perform much better in the levitation coil with regards to evaporation.
Recalescence due to undercooling was seen on two of the Ti-Ce drops. However,
oxidation on the surface of the droplets, both before, during, and after
dropping could not be prevented ever with the use of a hydrogen atmosphere.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Summary</B>

<P>&nbsp;A much-higher value of 1831&deg;K for the monotectic temperature
and a higher solid phase composition for the Ti-Ce system has been measured.&nbsp;
The liquid-to-solid undercoolings that were observed relative to this temperature
were larger in a low gravity, quiescent environment than in a 1-g, convectively
stirred condition.&nbsp; The tendency of the convection in the 1-g samples
to coalesce the droplets may have contributed to the lack of undercooling
compared to the relatively slower Marangoni flows experienced in the 0-g
samples.&nbsp; Wetting of one liquid phase by the other was not observed
due to the lack of instrument sensitivity.&nbsp; The Ce-rich liquid was
found to be the outer shell for all compositions across the miscibility
gap.

<P>&nbsp;The containerless, 0-g environment promotes the establishment
of equilibrium conditions for monotectic systems which can be beneficial
for constructing phase diagrams for high temperature, reactive monotectic
systems.&nbsp; Because of this, the 0-g equilibrium composition of the
rapidly solidified Ti-rich liquid of 7 w/o is higher than that reported
in other studies.&nbsp; The microstructural morphology of the phases observed
within the low-gravity samples was always spherically shaped droplets that
had secondary precipitation of Ce within the <FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>-Ti
that also was spherical.&nbsp; In contrast, the 1-g samples had <FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>-Ti
that was non-symmetrically shaped caused by the stirring of the EM field
of the levitation coil.&nbsp; Any secondary Ce precipitation was trapped
interdendritically.&nbsp; A quiescent, 0-g environment such as in space
with accurate temperature measurements could help eliminate some of the
questions regarding the effects on phase composition and microstructural
effects due to stirring, undercooling, and quench rate.
