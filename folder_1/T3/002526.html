<h1>Sugar: A Cautionary Tale</h1>

<p><i>Suzanne White Junod, Ph.D.<br>
  FDA Historian</i></p>

<p>Few people appreciate the truly influential role that sugar and food sweeteners 
  have played in food and drug regulatory history. A few historical snippets will 
  make the point: Sugar was one of the earliest and remains one of the best food 
  preservatives. Jams, jellies, and preserves, were critical for taking frontier 
  families from summer harvest through the winter to next spring's "starving time," 
  before the first harvest. It was an essential preservative in early industrializing 
  America as well, in addition to being an essential raw ingredient in alcohol, 
  which often constituted part of a workman's compensation. In addition to concerns 
  about adulteration, quality and safety in the late nineteenth century, the manufacture 
  of cheap candy became one of the earliest controversial women's labor issues 
  in the U.S. After the Civil War, America's trade deficit was largely due to 
  imported sugar. Harvey Wiley studied sugar chemistry in Germany and it was this 
  expertise that won him the appointment in Washington as Chief Chemist in the 
  Department of Agriculture, which was fully engaged in exploring domestic sugar 
  sources. Sugar, therefore became the crucible upon which Harvey Wiley's governmental 
  career first rose. </p>
<p>Assessments of the human health implications of sugar consumption, however, 
  have a much murkier past. Historical and anecdotal evidence for pediatric populations 
  is the clearest: Mothers' mantra of "no sweets before dinner," appears to be 
  one of the most eternal and ubiquitous of modern pediatric rules. More serious 
  allegations of adverse pediatric consequences, however, have not withstood scientific 
  scrutiny. In 1988, the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health concluded 
  that alleged links between sugar consumption and hyperactivity/attention deficit 
  disorders in children had not been scientifically supported. </p>
<p><img src="/oc/history/makinghistory/graphics/roosevelt-taft.jpg" alt="Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Taft" width="175" height="225" align="left" class="photoleft">As 
  for adults, it is clear that artificial sweeteners were one of the first regulated 
  foods "for special dietary use." Physicians in the early twentieth century, 
  had begun to recommend sugar restriction for some of their patients. A vague 
  conviction that overweight, under exercise, diabetes, and debilitation were 
  somehow linked dietetically in their patients is no where as well documented 
  as it is for Theodore Roosevelt, America's 26th president from 1901-1909. In 
  his early career, as a "Rough Rider" in the Spanish American war, Roosevelt 
  was the 19th century's embodiment of the physically active and robust outdoorsman 
  -- a true rugged individualist. His skill as a hunter was well known as well. 
  In 1902, while on a hunting expedition down the Mississippi River, Roosevelt 
  failed to locate suitable prey. Members of his hunting party, as the story goes, 
  not wishing the President to be disappointed, captured a bear cub and tied it 
  to a nearby tree for his pleasure. Roosevelt, however, refused to consider shooting 
  the cub and when the story was depicted in a <i>Washington Post</i> cartoon, 
  it inspired creation of one of America's most beloved toys: the teddy bear. 
  Apparently, however, by 1907, the President's desk job had taken its toll and 
  the President's physician, in an effort to curb his growing corpulence, prescribed 
  a diet devoid of sugar, replacing it with saccharin. In the context of early 
  food and drug regulation, however, the rest of the story is well known. </p>
<p>Shortly after passage of the 1906 Act, James S. Sherman, future Vice President 
  of the U.S., then representing Sherman Brothers, a food manufacturing firm in 
  New York, was granted an audience with President Roosevelt to discuss a number 
  of his firm's concerns, which included Wiley's opposition to his firm's use 
  of saccharin in canned corn. Wiley viewed it as both an illegal substitution 
  of a valuable ingredient (sugar) for a less valuable ingredient (saccharin) 
  in canned corn, as well as a health issue, since he had concluded from the bureau's 
  "poison squad" studies, that saccharin was deleterious to health. When Sherman 
  raised the issue with the President, claiming his firm had saved $4,000 the 
  previous year by employing the substitute sweetener, Wiley did not wait to be 
  cued into the conversation. </p>
<p>I did not wait for the President to ask the customary questions. I was entirely 
  too precipitate in the matter. . . . I immediately said to the President: "Everyone 
  who ate that sweet corn was deceived. He thought he was eating sugar, when in 
  point of fact he was eating a coal tar product totally devoid of food value 
  and extremely injurious to health." </p>
<p>Roosevelt's answer, Wiley rued, proved his undoing. </p>
<p> "You tell me that saccharin is injurious to health?" I said, "Yes, Mr. President, 
  I do tell you that." He replied, "Dr. Rixey gives it to me every day." I answered, 
  "Mr. President, he probably thinks you may be threatened with diabetes." To 
  this he retorted, "Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an idiot." 
  Wiley reported that this broke up the meeting and commented that "Had he only 
  extended his royal Excalibur I should have arisen as Sir Idiot." </p>
<p>The following day, the President appointed a Referee Board of Consulting Scientific 
  Experts to reconsider the government's early policies on food additives. Saccharin, 
  as one might have predicted, given the fact that the head of the Board, Johns 
  Hopkins professor, Dr. Ira Remsen, had discovered saccharin, received a pardon 
  from the Referee Board in their re-assessment of its safety. Sugar, therefore, 
  along with Remsen's rebuke of his findings, became the crucible upon which Harvey 
  Wiley's governmental career ultimately fell.<sup><a href="sugar.html#one">1</a></sup></p>
<p> The most recent sugar gauntlet was tossed when the World Health Organization's 
  highly publicized 2003 report on Diet, Nutrition, and the Prevention of Chronic 
  Diseases took an unexpected and highly controversial step: it singled out sugar 
  as a threat to the "nutrient quality of diets." Moreover, it specifically recommended 
  a population goal of making free sugars less than 10% of the total dietary energy 
  intake. Maintaining that free sugars provide "significant energy without specific 
  nutrients" and that "diets that are limited in free sugars have been shown to 
  reduce total energy intake and induce weight loss," the report singled out "drinks 
  that are rich in free sugars" saying that they "increase overall energy intake 
  by reducing appetite control." Equally controversially, the report took issue 
  with previous studies that purported to show that free sugars had no effect 
  on excess weight. WHO experts concluded that aside from mere issues of weight 
  loss, that the science did support the idea that there were demonstrable metabolic 
  differences between simple sugars and complex carbohydrates in the daily diet. 
  The WHO report, shifting scientific discussion from calories and weight loss 
  into metabolic functioning, is an indication that sugar is approaching yet another 
  historical turning point in food and drug history.<sup><a href="sugar.html#two">2</a></sup></p>
<p>By way of context: the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> published 
  an article on January 16, 2002, by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control 
  who estimated that as many as 47 million Americans may have &quot;metabolic 
  syndrome.&quot; Metabolic syndrome, as they defined it, was actually a cluster 
  of medical conditions characterized by insulin resistance, obesity, abdominal 
  fat, high blood sugar and triglycerides, high blood cholesterol, and high blood 
  pressure. Previously referred to as &quot;syndrome x&quot;, the term &quot;metabolic 
  syndrome&quot; was adopted in May, 2001 by the Third Report of the National 
  Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) by its Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, 
  and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. The NCEP report made it clear 
  that people who were both fat and inactive had more to pay attention to than 
  merely lowering their cholesterol numbers. CDC's subsequent refinement of a 
  &quot;case definition&quot; was critical to its acceptance by the wider medical 
  community.</p>
<p>The root cause of "metabolic syndrome," most experts agreed, was a "poor diet" 
  and insufficient physical activity. Historically, however, urban diets have 
  often been "poor," but were not necessarily linked with heart disease and diabetes. 
  Clearly exercise is a critical component in the equation and much in the modern 
  era will hinge on a more scientific definition of what constitutes a "poor diet." 
  The WHO report is simply the opening volley in what promises to be a lively 
  new chapter in the history of sugar.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, researching and reassessing the medical histories of former 
  U.S. presidents is a popular parlor game with medical historians, particularly 
  physicians. Over the years I've heard some stellar presentations on the medical 
  histories of Lincoln, Kennedy, Garfield, Taft, and others, but I'll bet I'll 
  be the first historian to retroactively diagnose Theodore Roosevelt with "metabolic 
  syndrome." </p>
