      </table>      <h2><a name="format"></a>The Stereograph Format</h2>

<p>Stereographs consist of two nearly identical
  photographs or photomechanical prints, paired
  to produce the illusion of a single three-dimensional
  image, usually when viewed through a stereoscope.
  Typically, the images are on card mounts, but
  they may take the form of daguerreotypes, glass
  negatives, or other processes. Stereographs
  were first made in the 1850s and are still made
  today. They were most popular between 1870 and
  1920.</p> 

<p>In 1851 stereo daguerreotypes were exhibited for the first time to the general public at the London International Exhibition (Crystal Palace).  Shortly thereafter, American photographers began making stereographs.  One of the first American photographic firms to produce stereographs was the team of  William and Frederick Langenheim.  The Library owns a set of their early stereoviews of American cities on the East Coast.</p> 
 
<p>By 1860 both amateur photographers and publishing
  firms were making stereographs. The major stereo
  publishers sold their views by mail order, door-to-door
  salesmen, and in stores. Stereographs
  were sold individually and in boxed sets.</p>

<p>Stereographs are usually mounted.  They were typically published with caption information printed under the image or on the back of the mount.  The mount also provided information about the publisher, photographer, and sometimes the series or a list of views available from the photographer or publisher.</p>

<p>Stereographs were collected by many middle-class families in the late 19th century.  People acquired stereographs of tourist sites they had visited, as well as exotic locales that they would only experience through the wonder of the stereoscope.  Viewing stereographs was a common activity, much like watching television or going to the movies today.  Stereoviews were also used as an education tool in classrooms. </p>

     </table>     <p>Stereographs were meant to be viewed in 3-D with a stereoscope.  Looking at the image up close and in 3-D allowed the viewer to enter the scene and examine the details of the photograph.</p>  

<p>In 1859 physician and poet  Oliver Wendell
  Holmes designed a hand-held viewer for stereoscopes.
  He also wrote an article about stereographs
  for the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> [available online at:
   <a href="http://www.cis.yale.edu/amstud/inforev/stereo.html">http://www.cis.yale.edu/amstud/inforev/stereo.html</a>].
  He vividly described viewing photographs in
  3-D:
</p>
  	<blockquote>The first effect of looking at a good photograph through the stereoscope is a surprise such as no painting ever produced.  The mind feels its way into the very depths of the picture.  The scraggy branches of a tree in the foreground run out as if they would scratch our eyes out.  The elbow of a figure stands forth so as to make us almost uncomfortable.  Then there is such a frightful amount of detail, that we have the same sense of infinite complexity which Nature gives us. A painter shows us masses; the stereoscopic figure spares us nothing... </blockquote>

<h2><a name="lc"></a>The Library of Congress Stereographs Collection</h2>

<p>Approximately 52,000 stereographs are organized
  and available for researchers onsite at the
  Library (roughly 10 percent of the collection
  is so far available online). The Library acquired
  many of the stereographs through copyright deposit,
  which accounts for
  the remarkable scope and breadth of the collection.
  Others were acquired as gifts, by purchase,
  exchange,
  or
  transfer
  from other government institutions. In adding
  to the stereo collection, the Library has particularly
  focused on acquiring views made before 1870
  (the year that the Library became home to the
  Copyright Office). Many of these stereographs
  were unpublished or published in small editions
  by local photographers. These images provide
  valuable information about the growth of cities
  and towns in the United States.
<p>The stereographs are arranged as follows:
<ul>
<li>A portion of the organized stereos are filed
  in the Reading Room by subject, geographic location,
  or portrait sitter. (Sample call number: STEREO
              US GEOG FILE - Georgia--Atlanta)</li>
<li>Another portion of the stereos stereos are
  organized into groups (LOTs) by subject, photographer,
  publisher, or donor. (Sample call number: LOT
  4164)</li>
</ul>
  <p>The online images feature cities and towns
    around the world, expeditions and expositions,
    industries, disasters, and portraits of Native
    Americans, presidents, and celebrities. They
    include views from nearly all of the fifty
    states and the District of Columbia, as well
    as more than twenty foreign countries. Particularly
    well represented are:</p>
