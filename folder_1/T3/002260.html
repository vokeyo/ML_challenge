<P>On August 2,1958, meanwhile, Dr. Detlev Bronk, president of the National 
Academy of Sciences-National Research Council,<SUP><U><FONT size=-1><A 
href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4003/ch1-3.htm#source11">11</A></FONT></U></SUP><FONT 
size=-2> </FONT>had formally announced the format ion of a 16-man Space Science 
Board to survey in concert the scientific problems, opportunities, and 
implications of man’s advance into space. This group, in actual being since 
June, was under the chairmanship of Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner.<SUP><U><FONT 
size=-1><A 
href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4003/ch1-3.htm#source12">12</A></FONT></U></SUP><FONT 
size=-2> </FONT>Besides acting as the focal point for all Academy Research 
Council activities connected with space science research, the board would 
"coordinate its work with the appropriate civilian and Government agencies, 
particularly the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National 
Science Foundation, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and with foreign 
groups active in this field."<SUP><U><FONT size=-1><A

Thus, within the scientific community there already existed the organizational 
framework, both in the Federal Government and in civilian groups, through which 
basic space science research—as contrasted with applied research and 
technology—could be administered. This could provide the vehicle for 
coordination of contracts and resources with universities and with industry. 
<P>In the spring of 1958, prior to the establishment of NASA, the Department of 
Defense had already formally requested that the Academy-Research Council 
establish an Armed Forces-NRC Committee on Bioastronautics that would concern 
itself, as necessary, with any field of science in order to pursue its 
objectives. Pertinent aspects of astronautics, biology, chemistry, medicine, 
psychology, and related disciplines would be included. Examples of specific 
research problems were closed-system environments; stress; crew selection, 
motivation, surveillance, and control, including group dynamics; ground support 
facilities; weightlessness; metabolic requirements, including nutrition and 
water balance; cosmic and other forms of radiation; isolation and confinement; 
displays, controls, and communication; circulation; deceleration and vibration; 
escape and survival; orientation; and man-machine system problems.<SUP><U><FONT

<P>On September 22, 1958, a planning group headed by Brig. Gen. Don D. 
Flickinger<SUP><A 
href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4003/ch1-3.htm#source*">*</A></SUP> met to 
consider possible courses of action.<SUP><U><FONT size=-1><A 
href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4003/ch1-3.htm#source15">15</A></FONT></U></SUP> 
The first meeting of the executive council was held in San Antonio, Tex., on 
November 10,1958,<SUP><U><FONT size=-1><A 
href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4003/ch1-3.htm#source16">16</A></FONT></U></SUP> 
with Dr. Melvin Calvin, University of California, serving as chairman.<SUP><A 
href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4003/ch1-3.htm#source**">**</A></SUP>&nbsp; 
This meeting was attended by Dr. Lovelace, Chairman of the new NASA Special 
Committee on Life Sciences, who noted that while the relationship of his 
Committee with other Government agencies was not yet clear, major functions were 
to be the formulation of policies and stimulation of all possible developments 
related to man's adaptation to space flight. He therefore welcomed liaison with 
the Armed Forces-NRC Committee. 
<P>Thus, by the fall of 1958 both the civilian and military scientific 
communities were geared to solution of the biomedical problems presented by the 
immediate objective of manned space flight. The interrelated efforts of the 
scientific community at the highest Government level in behalf of space 
exploration are indicated in chart 1. Through the next years, the biomedical 
problems of manned space flight were to be of continuing concern to the 
life-sciences community of the Nation.

organization, was established under a congressional charter signed by President 
Lincoln in 1863. In 1916, at the request of President Wilson, the Academy 
organized the National Research Council "to enable scientists generally to 
associate their efforts with those . . . of the Academy in service to the 
Nation, to society. and In science at home and abroad." Dr. Bronk was also a 
member of the President's Scientific Advisory Committee.
