    now: an asteroid hit Earth 65 million years ago and wiped out
    the dinosaurs. But in 1980 when scientists Walter and Luis Alvarez
    first suggested the idea to a gathering at the American Association
    for Advancement of Sciences, their listeners were skeptical.
    Asteroids hitting Earth? Wiping out species? It seemed incredible.</P>

    <P>At that very moment, unknown to the audience, an asteroid
    named Hermes halfway between Mars and Jupiter was beginning a
    long plunge toward our planet. Six months later it would pass
    300,000 miles from Earth's orbit, only a little more than the
    distance to the Moon. Rhetorically speaking, this would have
    made a great point in favor of the Alvarezes. Curiously, though,
    no one noticed the flyby.</P>

    </TABLE>1980 wasn't the first time Hermes had sailed by unremarked.
    Hermes is a good-sized asteroid, easy to see, and a frequent
    visitor to Earth's neighborhood. Yet astronomers had gotten into
    the habit of missing it. How this came to be is a curious tale,
    which begins in Germany just before World War II:</P>

    <P>On Oct. 28, 1937, astronomer Karl Reinmuth of Heidelberg noticed
    an odd streak of light in a picture he had just taken of the
    night sky. About as bright as a 9th magnitude star, it was an
    asteroid, close to Earth and moving fast--so fast that he named
    it Hermes, the herald of Olympian gods. On Oct. 30, 1937, Hermes
    glided past Earth only twice as far away as the Moon,  racing
    across the sky at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Nowadays only
    meteors and Earth-orbiting satellites move faster.</P>

    <P>Plenty of asteroids were known in 1937, but most were plodding
    members of the asteroid belt far beyond Mars. Hermes was different.
    It visited the inner solar system. It crossed Earth's orbit.
    It proved that asteroids could come perilously close to our planet.
    And when they came, they came fast.</P>

    <P>Reinmuth observed Hermes for five days. Then, to make a long
    story short, he lost it.</P>

    SRC="images/hermes/recovery.gif" WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="173" ALIGN="RIGHT"
    BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption"></A>Hermes approaches
    Earth's orbit twice every 777 days. Usually our planet is far
    away when the orbit crossing happens, but in 1937, 1942, 1954,
    1974 and 1986, Hermes came harrowingly close to Earth itself.
    We know about most of these encounters only because Lowell Observatory
    astronomer Brian Skiff re-discovered Hermes&#133; on Oct. 15,
    2003. Astronomers around the world have been tracking it carefully
    ever since. Orbit-specialists Steve Chesley and Paul Chodas of
    NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have used the new observations
    to trace Hermes' path backwards in time, and so they identified
    all the unnoticed flybys.</P>

    <P>&quot;It's a little unnerving,&quot; says Chodas. &quot;Hermes
    has sailed by Earth so many times and we didn't even know it.&quot;</P>

    <P>&quot;Hermes' orbit is the most chaotic of all near-Earth
    asteroids,&quot; he adds. This is because the asteroid is so
    often tugged by Earth's gravity. Hermes has occasional close
    encounters with Venus, too. In 1954 the asteroid flew by both
    planets. &quot;That was a real orbit scrambler,&quot; Chodas
    says. Frequent encounters with Earth and Venus make it hard to
    forecast Hermes' path much more than a century in advance. The
    good news is that &quot;Hermes won't approach Earth any closer
    than about 0.02 AU within the next hundred years.&quot; We're
    safe for now.</P>

    <P>Using the JPL ephemeris, we can look back and figure out what
    happened in 1937 when the asteroid was lost. With hindsight,
    it's understandable:</P>

    <P>Reinmuth first spotted Hermes approaching Earth from the direction
    of the asteroid belt. At first it was easy to see because the
    asteroid's sunlit side was facing Earth. Speedy Hermes soon crossed
    Earth's orbit, however, and began turning its night side toward
    us. Asteroids are nearly as dark as charcoal, and their night
    sides are very dim. By Nov. 3rd, six days after its discovery,
    the asteroid had faded from 9th to 21st magnitude, a factor of
    60,000. &quot;Hermes was also heading into the sun's glare, which
    only made matters worse,&quot; notes Chodas. Hermes literally
    vanished.</P>

    <P>No one seemed to care, not much. In 1937, World War II was
    about to begin in Europe, so people had a lot on their minds.
    Hermes failed to impress.</P>

    <P>Says Chodas: &quot;Astronomers of the day were somewhat biased,
    perhaps. They had convinced themselves that collisions were too
    rare to consider. Hermes didn't change their opinion because
    catastrophism was not in vogue.&quot;</P>

    SRC="images/hermes/sl9g_hst_med.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="251"
    ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption"></A>It's
    in vogue now--largely because of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9),
    an object discovered by people hunting for Hermes. Found in 1993
    by Gene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy, SL9 hit Jupiter
    in July 1994 with much of the world watching on CNN. Long before
    the collision, SL9 had been torn apart by Jupiter's powerful
    tides. The largest fragments, coincidentally about the same size
    as asteroid Hermes, exploded with such force when they struck
    that dark clouds formed in Jupiter's atmosphere as large as Earth
    itself.</P>

    <P>A message from Jupiter: Catastrophes happen.</P>

    <P>&quot;Gene always felt that Hermes should have done more to
    excite the world than it did at the time&quot; recalls David
    Levy. &quot;Indeed, he and his wife Carolyn were always hoping
    to find it.&quot; Shoemaker was a visionary who realized long
    before most others did that asteroids and comets posed an ongoing
    threat to Earth. In the late 1970's he and a few colleagues began
    to hunt for near-Earth objects using an 18-inch telescope at
    the Palomar Observatory. For a long while it was the only such
    survey on Earth. They discovered dozens of asteroids and comets,
    including SL9--but not Hermes. &quot;When Hermes passed by Earth
    in 1986 (an encounter identified post-facto by Chodas) it should
    have been an easy target for us,&quot; notes Levy. &quot;But
    the telescope was down for repairs.&quot; Shoemaker died in 1997
    not knowing how close he came.</P>

    <P>Now backyard astronomers around the world can do something
    Gene Shoemaker never did--see Hermes.</P>

    <P>Hermes is fast approaching Earth, and on Nov. 4th it will
    pass by our planet 18 times farther away than the moon. Already
    the asteroid is about as bright as a 13th magnitude star--an
    easy target for 8-inch telescopes equipped with CCD cameras.

    in Puerto Rico reveals asteroid Hermes to be a binary. [<A HREF="http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jlmargot/NEAs/Hermes/">more</A>]</FONT></P>

    <P>In recent days a group of NASA-supported astronomers led by
    Jean-Luc Margot of UCLA have pinged the asteroid with radar pulses
    from the giant Arecibo antenna in Puerto Rico. Hermes, it turns
    out, is a double asteroid--two space rocks orbiting one another,
    each about 400 meters across. No one knows how Hermes came to
    be this way. Margot and colleagues hope to learn more when the
    asteroid passes by on Nov. 4th as they continue their observations
    using both Arecibo and NASA's Goldstone radar.</P>

    <P>Now that Hermes has our attention, it might teach us a few
    things after all.</P>
