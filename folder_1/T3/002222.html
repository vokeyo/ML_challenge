<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Sometime
after World War II physicists began to change their way of giving names to
theoretical ideas. Before then,
new ideas were given titles such as &quot;special relativity theory&quot; or
&quot;neutrons.&quot; A precursor
of the new kinds of names came in 1953 when Murray Gell-Mann and Kazuhiko
Hishijima decided to name one of the properties of subatomic particles
&quot;strangeness.&quot; Gell-Mann
accelerated the trend in 1961 by calling his group-theoretic way of explaining
the properties of particles &quot;The Eightfold Way.&quot; Gell-Mann's crazy names finally reached
the consciousness of the general public in 1964 when he described the particles
involved in the next stage of his thinking as &quot;quarks.&quot; p. 508, source B</font></p>




<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Where did the names of the particles come from? Often times physicists are whimsical in
naming things, as termed by Chuck Brown, &quot;they are random and poetic in nature.&quot; So, below, in alphabetical order, I've done my best to try
to give you the true origin of the various particle names.</font></p>




<p><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=-1><b>atom<br />
</b>Troubled by the apparent &quot;chaos&quot; of the
everyday world, ancient Greek philosophers sought an underlying order, or
&quot;cosmos,&quot; in Nature.
Leucippus and Democritus viewed the world as composed of tiny particles,
or &quot;atoms&quot; &ndash; from the Greek word &quot;atomos&quot; for
&quot;uncuttable&quot; or &quot;indivisible.&quot;</FONT></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>baryon<br />
</b>Baryon number is something that only heavy particles
could have; therefore, baryon was taken from the Greeks because baros means
&quot;heavy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>bosons<br />
</b>Particles that obey the statistical system set up by
an Indian physicist, Satyendranath Bose, were originally called &quot;Bose
particles,&quot; and the name was later shortened to &quot;boson.&quot;</font></p>

<FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=-1>
<p><b>cascade particle (&Xi;)</b><br />
This particle, denoted by the Greek letter
&quot;xi,&quot; was called the &quot;cascade&quot; because it decayed into a
cascade of lighter fragments. p.
64, source D</p>
</FONT><p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>charm<br />
</b>In 1964, Sheldon L. Glashow had written an article with James Bjorken
suggesting a possible fourth quark.
&quot;We called our construct the 'charmed quark,'&quot; recalled
Glashow, &quot;for we were fascinated and pleased by the symmetry it brought to
the subnuclear world.&quot; Later
in 1974 Glashow was pushing scientists to find the charm. In doing so, he stated at a conference
that there were three possibilities:
&quot;One, charm is not found, and I eat my hat. Two, charm is found by spectroscopists,
and we celebrate. Three, charm is
found by 'outlanders' (other kinds of physicists who did neutrino
scattering or measured electron-positron collisions in storage rings), and you
eat your hats.&quot; p. 210,
source D</font></p>


<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">In 1976, charm was found by &quot;outlanders&quot;,
and a year later Glashow gave a rabble-rousing talk titled &quot;Charm Is Not
Enough.&quot; Then they all had a
big laugh as the spectroscopists present finally ate their hats &ndash; Mexican
candy hats were supplied by the organizers. p. 321, source D</font></p>



<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>color<br />
</b>In the autumn of 1971, Murray Gell-Mann and Harald Fritszch
began trying to understand how neutral pions decayed. However, these particles decayed nine times too
quickly. On the other hand, this
small problem would not occur if each quark came in three different kinds,
increasing the decay rate ninefold.
In this picture, each quark had to have some new physical property,
something that made them in fact different, which Gell-Mann with characteristic
aplomb dubbed merely color. "It was a natural choice," he
recalled. With Richard P. Feynman in the late
1950s, he had advocated "red" and "blue" neutrinos to distinguish two different
kinds of these ghosts, names that never caught on. Now he resurrected the old terminology and applied it to quarks,
which henceforth came in red, white, and blue varieties. He did not mean that quarks actually
had visible colors; that was absurd.
&quot;Color&quot; was just another name among many, plucked from
everyday discourse to help physicists communicate. Next, it was found that the grouping of quarks had to combine
so that they became &quot;colorless&quot; &ndash; that is, have zero net color. Because of this, physicists later
adopted a new terminology of red, green, and blue quarks over Gell-Mann's
original, more patriotic choice because red, green, and blue light can add up
neatly to give white, colorless light. pp. 228-229, source D</font></p>


<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>Eightfold Way<br />
</b>In 1961, Murray Gell-Mann reached into Chinese literature to
christen his classification scheme the &quot;Eightfold Way,&quot; a name that
soon captured the imagination of physicists around the world. The phrase comes from an aphorism attributed to
Buddha, about the appropriate path to Nirvana:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Now
this, O monks, is noble truth that leads to the cessation of pain; this
is the noble Eightfold Way:
namely, right views, right intention, right
speech, right action, right living, right effort, right
mindfulness, right concentration.</font></p></blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Arial">pp. 90-91, source D; p.
508, source B; p.
106, source C</font></p>



<font size="-1" face="Arial">
<p><b>fermion<br />
</b>Particles that obey the statistical system set up by
Enrico Fermi were originally called &quot;Fermi particles&quot; and later
shortened to &quot;fermions&quot;.</p>

<p><b>flavors<br />
</b>Although the names used currently for the original
three quarks are only a little peculiar &ndash; up, down, and strange &ndash; they also
were known at one time as vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. This accounts for the different kinds
of quarks being called different flavors of quark.</p>
</FONT><p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>gluons<br />
</b>Gluons are the &quot;glue&quot; that holds the
partons together in the nucleons. p.
508, source B</font></p>



<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>hadron<br />
</b>Hadron comes from the Greek word hadros, meaning
&quot;thick&quot; or &quot;heavy.&quot; p. 54, source C</font></p>


<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">The implication here is that it is a &quot;strong
particle,&quot; and these particles are thus named because they interact
strongly. p. 12, source C</font></p>



<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>isospin<br />
</b>The word isospin is a combination of isotope, meaning
&quot;same form,&quot; and spin. p.
54, source C</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>J/&Psi; particle<br />
</b>The
J/&Psi; particle is a combination of two names. J was the name given to the particle by Samuel Ting's group from
MIT and Brookhaven. &Psi; was the
name given to the particle by Burton Richter's group at SLAC. Each group had found the particle
independently and almost simultaneously.
As the story goes. . .</font></p>


<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">On Sunday, November 10, 1974, after searching for the
charm quark around 3 GeV, Richter's group found a peak at 3.105 GeV. Richter called one of his friends,
James  Bjorken, just as he had sat down to dinner and gave him the startling
news. &quot;I couldn't believe
such a crazy thing was so low in mass, was so narrow, and had such a high peak
cross-section,&quot; Bjorken recalled.
&quot;It was sensational.&quot;
He returned to the table a few minutes later, seemingly in a daze. His wife and children then watched
open-mouthed as he unthinkingly heaped a large tablespoon of horseradish onto
his baked potato and quietly began munching away, staring absentmindedly off into
space. &quot;BJ,&quot; his wife
finally counseled, &quot;I think you'd better go down to the lab
now.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">As the word of the fantastic discovery leaked out
into the SLAC community, a crowd of happy onlookers began to gather in the
SPEAR control room. Somehow amid
the euphoria, the physicists remembered the champagne. It ran low very fast, and there was a shortage
of glasses. Recruits departed for
more supplies. Meanwhile,
Gerson Goldhaber's original draft of the discovery paper had been made a shambles by
more recent data, so Richter began writing another version. The new particle needed a name, and he
first tried calling it the &quot;SP&quot; after the first two letters of
SPEAR. But nobody liked that very
much, so Richter went over to Leo Resvanais, a Greek physicist with the
University of Pennsylvania, and asked him what Greek letters were still
unused. Resvanais went down the
list alphabetically, until he came to iota, but Richter didn't like that very
much because it also meant something small, which this discovery was clearly
not. The next available letter was
psi, or &Psi;, which Richter thought might be confused with the Greek symbol for the
wave function, but Resvanais told him that psi was a good choice because this
discovery was certainly something big (psi's meaning). Most of the others liked the name,
especially after Goldhaber pointed out that it contained the letters s and p in
reverse order.</font></p>




<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Meanwhile, Ting from MIT, who was part of an experiment at Brookhaven, was unaware of the rumors circulating
there about the particles's discovery. His own discovery of the same particle had been achieved on
October 31. On November 4 or 5,
Ting showed his results to Victor Weisskopf, who told him he was crazy not to publish
immediately. Ting, however, wanted
to be very careful and make certain that he wasn't in error. By coincidence, on November 10, Ting
was headed for SLAC for a scheduled meeting. Unaware of the rumors circulating at Brookhaven, Ted Kycia asked
Ting if he had discovered anything yet.
Ting replied no. Little did
Ting know then of the rude shock awaiting him in California. While Ting was in flight, his group at
Brookhaven heard the news. Ting
called in at 1 a.m., and his experimenters had convinced themselves that this
was just a lousy practical joke being played on them. Ting, however, agreed to check it out anyway when he got to
SLAC the next day. But immediately
after he arrived at his motel, Ting received a call that SLAC had indeed
discovered a resonance. Worried
now, Ting called Stanley Brodsky, a SLAC theorist he knew, and learned that
yes, indeed, there had been a big discovery that would be announced
tomorrow. For Ting, it was the
moment of truth. He was about to
be scooped on the greatest discovery of the year, if not the decade. His weeks of cautious silence now had
to be undone overnight. The battle
began, each group trying to get the paper in first. By the time Ting's paper was written, Ting had dubbed his
particle the &quot;J,&quot; a letter that closely resembled the Chinese
ideogram for Ting. pp. 276-289,
source D</font></p>



<font size="-1" face="Arial"><p>The touchy issue of what to call the first particle,
J or psi, had been smoldering ever since it became obvious that each group was
sticking by its own name. So
physicists began deliberately using the dual label J/&Psi; in their
talks and papers, to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. This was the label that stuck.</p>
</FONT><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Just as a side note, in the first few months, the
contest over which name to use seemed to be fairly good-natured. Ting's troops began to offer and wear
T-shirts with &quot;J-3.1 GeV&quot; emblazoned on the front. SLAC-LBL physicists kidded that
&quot;the particles themselves preferred the &Psi; label.&quot; To prove their point, they passed around
photos of a computer display showing a &Psi; disintegrating into two pions and the two
muons. The four visible tracks had
arranged themselves neatly into the four arms of a near-perfect letter
psi. pp. 311-313, source D</font></p>







<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>lepton<br />
</b>Lepton comes from the Greek word meaning
&quot;light&quot; (opposite of heavy) or &quot;small.&quot; It was originally the name of a small
Greek coin. p. 53, source E; p.
183, source A</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>meson<br />
</b>The meson was originally called the
&quot;X-particle&quot; by Carl Anderson and Seth Neddermeyer. Eventually it was found to be a
middleweight particle, or &quot;middle particles&quot; between the light lepton
and the heavy baryon. The Caltech
group promoted the name &quot;mesotron&quot; for it, from the Greek
&quot;mesos&quot; for &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;middle.&quot; This was the name generally used,
although the particle was also called the &quot;meson&quot; or &quot;heavy
electron&quot; in Europe. pp.
50-51, source D; p. 183, source A</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>muon<br />
</b>Cecil Powell used the nomenclature more common to
Europe to name the light particle the &quot;mu-meson&quot; or &quot;&mu;-meson&quot;
from the Greek letter &quot;mu&quot; or &quot;&mu;.&quot; Today the name has been shortened to
&quot;muon.&quot; p. 52, source
D</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>neutrino<br />
</b>In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli postulated that an invisible particle
was emitted during radioactive beta decay along with the electron, which
carries off missing energy and angular momentum. The original reaction conserved electric charge, so the new
particle must be neutral. On the
strength of this, Enrico Fermi called it the neutrino. Neutrino is the Italian word for &quot;little neutral
one&quot; and is denoted by the Greek letter &quot;nu&quot; or &quot;&nu;.&quot; p. 67, source D; p. 40, source A</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>omega particle (&Omega;)<br />
</b>If the Eightfold Way were true, then theory suggested
that there had to be a tenth baryon resonance since nine had been previously
found. The Greek letter omega (&Omega;) seemed an
appropriate choice by Murray Gell-Mann for this final member of the baryon decimet
because it was the last letter in the Greek alphabet. </font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>parton<br />
</b>Parton means &quot;partial particles.&quot; Richard P. Feynmam called them partons
because the hadron was made of many particles.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>pion<br />
</b>Cecil Powell used the nomenclature more common to
Europe to name this heavy particle the &quot;pi-meson&quot; or &quot;&pi;&quot;. Today, the name has been shortened to
pion. p. 52, source D</font></p>

<font size="-1" face="Arial">
<p><b>positron<br />
</b>Carl Anderson, a postdoc under Robert Millikan, had
been working alone, taking photographs of cosmic ray tracks at Caltech. Anderson showed a curious photo to
Millikan, who agreed with Anderson that the track shown could only be positive. They dubbed the particle the
&quot;positron,&quot; for &quot;positive electron.&quot; </p>
</FONT><p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>quark<br />
</b>The quark model was introduced independently by Murray
Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964.
Gell-Mann called the triplet of the new particles &quot;quarks,&quot;
and Zweig called them &quot;aces,&quot; like the aces in playing cards. p. 104, source C</font></p>


<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Gell-Mann's crazy names finally reached the
consciousness of the general public in 1964 when he described the particles
involved in the next stage of his thinking as &quot;quarks.&quot; Gell-Mann and Zweig pointed out that
the representations of SU(3) [Special Unitary group of transformations of
dimension 3], which were occupied by particles, could be chosen from among all
those mathematically possible by assuming them to be generated by just two
combinations of the fundamental representation. p. 57, source A; p. 508, source B</font></p>



<font size="-1" face="Arial">
<p>Gell-Mann called the entities in the fundamental
representation quarks. This is the
rather idiosyncratic use of a German word meaning curds or slop (abstracted for
this purpose from the novel <i>Finnegan's Wake</i> by
James Joyce). And this is how it
all began.</p>



<p>Gell-Mann had a luncheon conversation with Columbia
theorist Robert Serber, Tsung Dao Lee, and others. While they were eating, Serber mentioned why a fundamental
triplet did not appear in Nature.
According to Serber, Gell-Mann's immediate reply was, &quot;That would
be a funny quirk!&quot; Tsung Dao
Lee chimed in, calling it &quot;a terrible idea.&quot; Pulling out pen and napkin, Gell-Mann
showed Serber why. Such a triplet,
if it existed at all, had to have fractional charges of 2/3, -1/3, and
-1/3. Serber had to agree that
these were odd birds, indeed; ever since Robert Millikan's famous oil-drop
experiment, nothing but whole-number charges had ever been observed.</p>
</FONT><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">While a visiting lecturer at MIT that year, Gell-Mann
had been seeking a simple basis for the Eightfold Way. He knew about triplets but always
passed them over without much thought because of the fractional charges
involved. Serber's offhand query
now catalyzed his thinking. Later
that evening and the following morning, Gell-Mann began to realize that
fractional charges were not completely absurd &ndash; as long as they could never
appear in Nature. Gell-Mann began
calling these whimsical motes quorks, a nonsense word he had used previously,
in the spirit of Lewis Caroll, to mean &quot;those funny little
things.&quot; Serber thought it was
a play on the word quirk used at lunch.
Whatever the case, Gell-Mann mentioned these quorks in his next lecture,
giving Serber credit for proposing the fundamental triplet. Although he quickly moved on to other
topics, quorks were a favorite subject of discussion at the subsequent coffee
hour. Gell-Mann was in no great
hurry to publish the quork idea.
There were a number of puzzles to resolve, and he had other commitments
demanding his attention. Back at
Caltech that fall, he began working out the details in earnest. In a phone call to his old MIT thesis
adviser, Victor Weisskopf, Gell-Mann mentioned he was working on a new and
exciting idea: that baryons and mesons were composed of three fractionally charged
entities. &quot;Please, Murray,
let's be serious,&quot; came Weisskopf's reply. &quot;This is an international call.&quot;</font></p>



<font size="-1" face="Arial">
<p>By then the widely read theorist had found a telltale
passage in James Joyce's enigmatic novel, <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>:</p>
</FONT><blockquote><p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Three
quarks for Muster Mark!<br />
Sure
he hasn't got much of a bark<br />
And
sure any he has it's all beside the mark.<br />
But
O, Wreneagle Almighty, wouldn't un be a sky of a lark<br />
To
see that old buzzard whooping about for uns shirt in the dark.<br />
And
he hunting round for uns speckled trousers around by Palmerston Park? </font></p>

</blockquote>



<font size="-1" face="Arial"><p>This poem is the drunken dream of Humphrey Chimpden
Earwicker as he lies passed out on the floor of his Dublin tavern. Gell-Mann happily borrowed the <i>quark
</i>spelling for his imaginary triplet. No doubt he also enjoyed the irony of the last few
lines. There is an obvious parallel
between the trials of Muster Mark and the seemingly hopeless plight of eager
experimenters who would inevitably go searching for motes they could never
possibly find.</p>



<p>Meanwhile at Caltech, Zweig was reading
publications of bubble chamber experiments in 1963 and was puzzled as to why
some particles elected to decay by the most difficult path available. He first guessed that a conservation
law was at work because it was the only one allowed. While fiddling with group theories, Zweig inadvertently
discovered that he could get collections of particles if baryons were built
from three constituents with fractional charges.</p>
</FONT>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">At first, it seemed an artificial solution. Then things began to fall into
place. That fall at CERN, Zweig
wrote up his discoveries for publication, calling his fractionally charged
particles aces. Mesons, which were
built from pairs of these aces, formed the deuces and baryons the treys in his
deck of cards. Just cut the deck,
shuffle the cards, and you could deal all kinds of poker hands. pp. 102-104, source D</font></p>



<font size="-1" face="Arial">
<p>Just so I don't leave you hanging, I don't know the
reason why the name quark beat out the name aces. But I do know that while the two theories were essentially
the same physics, stylistically they were poles apart. Sorry! (If you do find out, please tell
me.)</p>
</FONT><p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>strange<br />
</b>In 1947, the English physicists George D. Rochester and
  Clifford C. Butler observed new particles which were a thousand times more massive
than the electron. These particles
were often associated with V-shaped tracks; they were at first called V
particles. Their origin and
purpose were an entire mystery.
For the following six years, the V particles were observed, and two kinds
became apparent. Those whose decay
products always include a proton are called hyperons or Lambda particles, and those whose decay products consist only
of mesons are called K mesons or kaons.
The hyperons and kaons soon became known as the strange particles
because of their anomalous (strange) behavior. pp. 49-50, source A</font></p>


<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Originally, strangeness was introduced to explain why
some hadrons decay quickly by the strong nuclear force while others decay
slowly by the weak force. p.
185, source A</font></p>


<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Strange came from the fact that something
&quot;strange&quot; was going on with a third particle that was neither an up
nor a down quark. (Drasko
Jovanovic) Lacking any good explanation, theorists simply dubbed them
&quot;strange&quot; particles, a name that has survived to this day as the
label for a completely new property of matter. The quark that all strange particles contain is known as the strange quark, and it is this quark that gives them their property of &quot;strangeness.&quot;</font></p>



<p><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>strangeness<br />
</b>&quot;Strangeness&quot; is a term, a name, for a
property of matter seen only in violent collisions of subatomic particles; it
has no corresponding meaning in the everyday world of our senses that language
was originally developed to describe.
Physicists have had to create a new nomenclature in order to begin
talking with each other about the weird subatomic landscape. One way they do so is to borrow words
from everyday language and use them in entirely new ways. In this case, &quot;strangeness&quot; is a property found in particles containing the strange quark. </font></p>

<font size="-1" face="Arial"><p><b>top/bottom or truth/beauty<br />
</b>As two more quarks came to be required in 1978 and
following years, it was no longer surprising that some physicists would call
the new ones beauty and truth.
Theorists had predicted the quarks long before they were found, naming
them the &quot;t&quot; and &quot;b&quot; quarks for top and bottom -- varients
of the labels &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down.&quot; Top and bottom came from the fact that there had to be a
pair of particles, heavier in nature, with up and down spins also. (Drasko Jovanovic)</p>
</FONT>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">The more whimsically inclined favored
&quot;truth&quot; and &quot;beauty,&quot; so that experimenters might begin the
search for naked truth and beauty.
However, at this point, more prosaic imaginations prevailed, so most
physicists call beauty &quot;bottom &quot;and truth &quot;top.&quot; In any case, when physicists searched for the existence of
the last two quarks to be named, they had an interesting choice as to how to
describe their work to outsiders.
Since the object was to find the beauty or bottom quark in undisguised
form, they could choose to say they were looking for either &quot;bare
bottom&quot; or &quot;naked beauty.&quot;
The search was serious, even if the names were playful. p. 508, source B; p. 331, source D </font></p>



<font size="-1" face="Arial">
<p><b>upsilon<br />
</b>In 1975, Leon Lederman and his group finally began
searching for particles like the J/&Psi; with masses above 5 GeV. In 1976, they thought they had found one. Observing electron-positron pairs
produced in the collisions of 400 GeV protons with beryllium nuclei, they found
only twenty-seven at high mass.
But twelve of these pairs clustered around a mass of 6 GeV, suggesting
the existence of a neutral, spin-1 particle. Lederman and company published their find, dubbing their
particle the &Upsilon;. Upsilon was determined when Leon
Letterman and his group at Fermi were in a portacamp. Around 3 a.m. they tried to write down all the Greek letters
that hadn't been used before. (Chuck
Brown)</p>
</FONT>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">When they repeated the experiment that summer,
however, the peak withered away.
The peak must have been just a statistical fluctuation that had fooled
the group. Jokes began to
circulate around Fermilab that they had only discovered the &quot;oops
Leon.&quot; Not long after this,
experimenters noticed another small bump.
Once burned and twice shy, they checked their analysis and began
preparing yet another experiment.
In August 1977, Lederman presented the combined data revealing three
peaks. He recommended calling
these particles &Upsilon;, &Upsilon;', and &Upsilon;&quot;
as this label was obviously no longer needed for the 6 GeV peak. pp. 329-330, source D</font></p>



<font size="-1" face="Arial">
<p><b>up/down<br />
</b>Originally, depending on whether the spin of the
nucleon (this is the quark part of the nucleon) was parallel or anti-parallel
to the direction of the angular momentum, it was called up or down
respectively. (Drasko Jovanovic)</p>

<p><b>W particle<br />
</b>The W stands for &quot;weak.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Z particle<br />
</b>The Z means that there is &quot;zero&quot; charge.</p>
