<u>Sea level, ice sheets, lakes</u> For cartographic convenience,
coastlines are drawn at the -150 m bathymetric contour (the only shelf
contour available on most atlas maps), although this is almost certainly
too great a lowering, as sea level was probably only around 120-140m
lower than now (H. Faure pers. comm.). <p>

An ice sheet was present at the southern end of the Andes, flowing down
onto the exposed continental shelf. Other ice caps were present in the
high Andes further north. Ice sheet extent in this map is based on map
drawings by Denton &amp; Hughes (1991), Iriondo (1988), and L. &amp; C.
Heusser (pers. comm., Feb. 1990). In the Bolivian Andes, the maximum
glacier advances seem to have been around 20,000-18,000 radiocarbon
years ago, coinciding with the 'global' glacial maximum. However, in the
Ecuadorian Andes the maximum was around 25,000 years ago, whilst in the
Mexican uplands the maximum glacier extent occurred about 15,000 years
ago (Heine 1995). <p>

<p>

<i>Broad-scale climatological evidence</i>. Recent broad-scale evidence
from ice cores in the high Andean <A HREF="http://www-bprc.mps.ohio-state.edu/Icecore/Abstracts/TM_TDLHDBL.95.html">Huascaran Glacier core,</A> (10 S, 78 W)
indicates a much greater dust input (about 200 times Holocene levels)
between 20,000 and 14,500 years ago (Thompson <u>et al</u>. 1995). This
favours the view that at least some areas in the South American tropical
region were considerably drier than at present during the LGM. Broecker
(1995) suggests that the dust input reflects severe Amazon lowland
aridity, although one should probably consider instead that the dust was
derived from the desert areas that had appeared outside the main Amazon
Basin (see below).<p>
<P>Nitrate levels in the Huascaren Glacier fell by a factor of two to three and dust concentrations
increased 200-fold. Thompson et al. conclude that these indicate that there
was substantial drying and a significant reduction (40-50%) of the rain forest in
the nearby Amazon River basin, with forest cover being much less than present at the LGM,
but reaching a minimum slightly later (about 15,000 14C y.a,).</P>

<P>Hydrogen isotopes in the same glacier cores suggest that sea surface
temperatures in the tropical Atlantic source area for the moisture were
some 5 or 6&#176;C cooler than at present (contrasting with previous,
planktonically-based estimates which suggest at 2&#176;C lowering), and
oxygen isotopes suggest the same picture for the general region where
the ice was being deposited (Thompson <u>et al</u>. 1995, Broecker
1995). <p>

<p>

<i>A lake over Amazonia? Generally thought very unlikely</i>. On the
basis of the topography and drainage patterns of the Amazon, Campbell
(1989) has suggested that a huge lake ('Lake Amazonas') existed in the
Amazon Basin at this time, flooding the basin to 300m above sea level.
This would have been held in place by a huge sediment dam in the lower
Amazon (or possibly through downwarping of the crust in the central
Amazon), and its discharge events in the early Holocene may have
corresponded to freshwater discharge events recorded for the Amazon
delta region. Of course, if Campbell's hypothesis were correct, it would
make discussion of the LGM vegetation of the Amazon Basin largely
irrelevant because everything would have been covered in water. This
view is strongly disputed by most who work on this area. Colinvaux
(1993) cites recent work by Rasanen <u>et al</u>. as disproving the
supposed existence of Lake Amazonas, as there is no evidence of the
widespread layer of sediment that such a lake would have been be
expected to produce. Clapperton (1993) discusses the hypothesis at
length, before rejecting it completely on various grounds. Note that LGM
pollen cores dating from the LGM have also now been obtained from the
central Amazon (see below), showing directly that at least some areas
were not inundated (though this site is on a hilltop). <p>

<p>

<u>Central America and the Caribbean.</u> <p>

<p>

<i>Fairly similar conditions to the present in central Mexican uplands?
</i>In the highlands of central Mexico, three pollen records indicate a
predominance of <i>Pinus-Juniperus</i> woodland at 18,000 14C years ago,
fairly similar to the vegetation today (Markgraf 1993). However, the
absence of deciduous broad-leaved taxa suggest that the climate was in
fact slightly drier than today's. The higher percentages of steppic
species such as <i>Artemisia</i> and <i>Ambrosia</i> likewise suggest
drier, more open vegetation. From another core from Chalco Lake in
Mexico City (part of the highland massif) (19. 30' N, 99. 00' W),
aridity around 18,000 y.a. is indicated by the absence of the Holocene
and late-glacial forest cover, and the dominance of grassland vegetation
(Lozano-Garcia <u>et al</u>. 1993). <p>

At higher altitudes, a combination of geomorphological and palynological
evidence suggests a temperature depression of 4.2&#176;C above 4,000m
(Heine 1995). <p>

There are not yet any records from the Mexican lowlands dating back to
the LGM, but one upland core in coastal mid Mexico suggests a drier
vegetation of grassland and herbs just before the start of the Holocene,
being replaced by the Holocene vegetation of savanna-forest mosaic
(Markgraf 1993). <p>

<p>

<i>Colder and drier, with grassland and sparse scrub in lowland
Guatemala</i>. In Central America, the evidence is of generally drier
than present conditions. Binford <u>et al</u>. (1987) present pollen
evidence that indicates the prevalence of savanna before 10,000
<sup>14</sup>C years ago in the Peten Lowlands of Guatemala, an area
which currently supports seasonal semi-evergreen forest. In a lowland
site (Lake Quexil) in the same area of Guatemala, Leyden <u>et al</u>.
(1993) have found pollen, sedimentological and isotopic data indicating
a much drier and much cooler climate than today during the period that
includes the LGM. The vegetation was a sparse dry temperate scrub and
grassland, of a type that now grows above 1500m. A mean annual
temperature depression of about 6.5 - 8.0&#176;C is suggested from the
pollen evidence. <p>

<p>

<i>Deciduous forest in lowland Panama.</i> In the lowlands of Panama,
pollen evidence indicates that forest was still present in the area that
presently supports rainforest, but that it was more seasonal (drought
deciduous) and more open than today (Bush &amp; Colinvaux 1990). Again,
the occurrence of montane tree species suggests significantly cooler
temperatures on land, even at sea level, although Bush suggests that
maximum cooling may have occurred somewhat after the LGM. The mixture of
lower montane and lowland tropical elements suggests a forest community
that has no compositional analogue in the present-day world. Piperno
<u>et al</u>. (unpublished manuscript) discuss their core from another
site at La Yegunda, a lake at 650m a.s.l. (8 N, 8 W). The part of their
sequence from the last glacial, beginning at 14,000 years ago, shows a
vegetation subject to a substantial reduction in rainfall (about
1000mm), which they suggest would have been enough to reduce the
vegetation on the adjacent central plain of Panama (presently natural
forest cover) to thorn scrub and savanna parkland. The site itself
remained forested however, with the presence of <i>Quercus
</i>suggesting a 5&#176;C lower-than-present temperature. Colinvaux
(pers. comm., Aug. 1993) appears to suggest that the drying observed in
lowland Panama was in fact mainly a lower Holocene event, although he
does not specify his reasons for thinking that this is so. <p>

<p>

<i>Lowering of treeline in Central American mountains</i>. From pollen
evidence, Markgraf (1993) reports that there was a treeline lowering of
600-800m in the Central American mountains, relative to the Holocene.
From this, mean temperatures would seem to have been some 4&#176;C below
the present. Below 2400m, arboreal taxa were predominant. <p>

However, a more drastic temperature and vegetation zone lowering is
suggested by results from high altitudes in Costa Rica, at La Chonta bog
in the Cordillera de Talamanca, the upper forest line seems to have been
at around 2000m elevation during the LGM, compared to the present forest
line of around 3300-3500m (Hooghiemstra <u>et al</u>. 1992). This
apparently corresponds to a temperature lowering relative to the present
of around 8&#176;C at these altitudes. <p>

<p>

<i>Drier conditions in Caribbean.</i> For the Caribbean islands, the
general indications from pollen, sediment fluxes, lake levels and
biogeography are of drier conditions. Bonnatti &amp; Gartner (1973)
obtained a core from the central Caribbean Sea, and noted fluctuations
between drier and wetter phases (the dry phases indicated by higher
quartz content and lower kaolin content). They suggested from the change
in sedimentation at the topmost part of the core, that the dry phases
represent glacial periods such as the last glacial. On Haiti (Hodell
1990), the record does not go back to the LGM although during the
possibly 'glacial-like' phase of Younger Dryas age, lake levels were
lower than today, and in an area naturally occupied by mesic forest
there was instead low scrub (consisting of palms and montane shrubs) and
grassland  - a possible indicator of what LGM conditions were like?
Similarly, the changing level of a karstic lake in western Jamaica would
seem to indicate drier conditions than at present during the late
glacial than during the Holocene (poster in School of Geography, Oxford,
1994; J.A. Holmes, F.A. Street-Perrott &amp; A. Perrott; published as
Street-Perrott <u>et al</u>. 1993 in <i>J. Palaeoliminology</i>). <p>

<p>

<i>Galapagos aridity.</i> There is also lake level evidence for drier
LGM conditions on the Galapagos islands, to the west of South America,
before the beginning of the Holocene (Colinvaux 1972). Colinvaux (1987)
also cites pollen evidence from the Interandean Plateau of Ecuador to
suggest that this aridity likewise affected the Pacific coast of South
America adjacent to the Galapagos (see below). <p>

<p>

<u>The northern coast of South America</u>. <i>Savanna and dunes in
Venezuela</i>. To the north of the Amazonian region, close to the
northern shore of Venezuela, a pollen record starting at around 13,000
BP shows sparse grassland vegetation in an area which was occupied by
open deciduous forests up until pre-agricultural times (Leyden 1985). In
the regions of northern Venezuela which are now naturally savanna,
pollen evidence going back to about 15,000 years ago indicates
considerably more arid than present conditions (Van der Hammen 1984). On
the basis of the extensive 'fossilised' sand dunes consisting of
wind-worked grains in the llanos region of Venezuela, Clapperton (1993)
reconstructs extensive dune fields and sand desert north-west of the
Orinoco River.  M. Sarnthein (pers. comm., June 1993) has told me that
he has recently seen data which confirm his reconstruction of dune
fields in southern Venezuela at approximately the LGM, but he does not
specify the source of this information. <p>

<p>

<i>Drier in Guyana region. </i> For the coastal Guyanas also, Van der
Hammen (e.g. Wijmstra and van der Hammen 1966) finds evidence of drier
conditions prior to 13,000 <sup>14</sup>C years ago. During glacial-time
low sea-level periods, northern Guyana (Georgetown) and Surinam -
presently wet forest - were covered with dry grass savanna.<p>

 <p>

<i>Reduction in forest cover of Venezuelan highlands</i>. For the
Venezuelan Highlands (a lower, northern extension of the Andes),
Salgado-Labouriau <u>et al</u>. (1977) have found pollen evidence of a
low tree line and cold, dry conditions prior to 12,600 <sup>14</sup>C
years ago. In this site, at around 13,000 years ago when deposition
resumes after a hiatus during the last glacial, the level of the modern
lake Valencia was reduced to swamp and surrounded by thorn scrub or
savanna rather than the present seasonal forest (Thomas &amp; Thorp
1992). <p>

<p>

<u>Amazonia.</u> <p> <i>The region in general</i>. Little is known of
large areas of Amazonia at the LGM. The 2-3 fold reduction nitrate input to the
Huascaren Andean glacier (10S) (see above) is suggested as indicating that there was
much less forest cover in South America during the Last Glacial period,
reaching a minimum at around 15,000 radiocarbon years ago (Thompson
<u>et al</u>. 1995, Broecker 1995), but the true controls and source
areas of this nitrate flux may be open to question. <p>

The peripheral regions and the edges of the Amazon Basin itself often
show fossil or sedimentological evidence of drier-than-present climates,
but not always.  Most of those who work on the Quaternary of the South
American tropics believe that the general climatic aridity seen
elsewhere in South America would have extended across and drastically
reduced the extent of rainforest in the Amazon Basin at the LGM.
However, Colinvaux believes that the climate systems of (for example)
the western Andes and the Caribbean are sufficiently distinct from that
of the Amazon Basin that there may have been little drying of climate
and reduction in lowland forest cover. Instead, Colinvaux emphasises
cooling as a more important influence on the glacial-age ecology of
Amazonia.  <p>

<p>

<i>Haffer's refugial hypothesis</i>. On the basis of evidence of drier
conditions at about the LGM around the periphery of Amazonia, and from
available knowledge on diversity patterns of rainforest plants and
animals, Haffer (1969) and others suggested that glacial-age aridity
reduced the forest to small and scattered refugia, which presently have
higher species diversity. However, this hypothesis has been to some
extent put in doubt by evidence that the apparent diversity patterns
might be a collecting artefact (Nelson <u>et al</u>. 1990) and also
evidence that a montane-type forest had replaced the species-rich
lowland rainforest in one of Haffer's proposed refugial areas, in the
eastern foothills of the Andes (Liu &amp; Colinvaux 1985) (see below).
<p>

<p>

<u>Pollen evidence of the history of rainforest distribution</u>; <p>

<p>

<i>Amazon Delta evidence of forest survival</i>.  <p>

A recent source of evidence suggests that although there was
considerable cooling at the LGM, Amazon aridity was less severe than
some might suggest. A long core (ODP Leg 155) obtained offshore from the
Amazon Fan shows an LGM pollen flora with greater-than-present
representation of grassland/savanna species, but also with abundant
pollen from trees of cool and moist environments, such as <i>Alnus
</i>and <i>Podocarpus</i>. This suggests that there was some drying but
also a considerable persistence of forest in the Amazon lowlands at the
LGM, under cooler (perhaps 6&#176;C lower) conditions than at present
(Haberle 1995). However, Kerr (1996) notes that greater aridity and
savanna expansion during the last glacial might have been disguised by a
high influx of tree pollen into the rivers from gallery  forests. <p>

<p>

<i>LGM forest survival in central Amazonia</i>. At least one LGM forest
refuge has now been found by Colinvaux's group. In four recent lake
cores from a hill in the upper Rio Negro area (ON, 67W. 300m a.s.l.) of
west-central Amazonia, De Oliveira <u>et al</u>. (1995) and  Colinvaux
<u>et al</u>. (1996) find pollen evidence for persistence of closed
forest at the LGM with a considerable montane element (about 10%
<i>Podocarpus</i>). This result seems to confirm that there would have
been a considerable area of closed forest in Amazonia, covering at least
the current area of higher rainfall in the centre and west of the Amazon
Basin. However, its community composition was apparently much altered
from today's, indicating a 5-6&#176;C cooling. As we have earlier
pointed out on this web page, and as Kerr (1996) also points out, this
site is within the current high-rainfall core area of west-central
Amazonia (more than 2500mm annual precipitation) and so it would perhaps
be expected to have remained as forest even if there had been
considerable forest regression in the east, north and south of the
Amazon region.  <p>

<p>

<i>Eastern Amazonia; forest regression from the south-east. </i> It is
generally thought that at the LGM the forest would have regressed from
areas that are presently the most marginal, due to reduction in rainfall
along approximately the same gradients that occur today. <p>

This view seems to gain support from the evidence of loss of forest from
the edges of the Amazon Basin and its replacement by grasslands or
savannas. In Serra dos Carajas (50W, 6S) in south-eastern Amazonia - a
plateau area which presently receives relatively low rainfall, with
semi-evergreen rainforest and some open woodland and savanna and annual
precipitation around 1,500-2,000 mm (compared to adjacent regions of
2,000-3,000 mm) - lake pollen evidence indicates a savanna expansion,
increased clastic content of sediment, and then a sedimentary hiatus at
around the LGM, possibly due to aridity causing the lake itself to dry
up (B. Turcq, pers. comm.; Absy <u>et al</u>. 1991,<i> </i>and Ledru
1992).  <p>

Two more cores taken from swamps in the Carajas area (Sifeddine <u>et
al</u>. 1994, Manuscript submitted) agree with this picture in showing a
general forest regression and replacement by scrub and savanna, and a
lowering of the water level followed by a hiatus at the driest phase
constrained by radiocarbon dates to between around 20,000 and 13,000
<sup>14</sup>C years ago. Note that Colinvaux feels that the vegetation
changes indicated in the Carajas area may be unrepresentative of the
situation across the Amazon region in general, because it is at the
physiological margins of rainforest vegetation. He suggests (pers. comm.
1993) that the main bulk of the Amazon rainforest would have suffered
relatively little from such a change in water balance across the region,
and not enough to cause much of the forest to give way to woodland or
savanna. <p>

Behling (1996) presents results from a lake core from an island in the
Amazon delta (0 46' S, 47 51' W) starting at around 11,500
<sup>14</sup>C y.a. He finds that a diverse closed forest vegetation
(with no savanna elements) already predominated at this time, though
with abundant montane elements (<i>Podocarpus, Ilex</i>) suggesting a
cooler climate. To what extent this vegetation represents the type that
was present in the general area several thousand years before at the LGM
is uncertain. <p>

<u>N.B</u>. Even the present-day rainfall distribution over the Amazon
Basin is still a matter of some conjecture because of the lack of
meteorological stations within the forest zone, the considerable
year-to-year variability in rainfall, and the strong influence slight
differences in local topography on storm precipitation. Different
published annual precipitation maps suggest differing
distributions of rainfall gradients and maxima, based on different
methods of extrapolation (often heavily biased by particular abnormal
point values). On the advice of J. Roberts (Institute of Hydrology,
Oxfordshire, England; pers. comm. 1991) and P. Jones (University of East
Anglia, pers. comm. 1990), the <i>Times World Atlas</i> precipitation
map can be seen as generally reliable on a broad scale. This
precipitation map is used here in a general sense as a reference point
for discussion of rainfall gradients in the past and present. <p>

<p>

<i>Southern edge of Amazonia; strong forest regression. </i>At Katira
Creek (approx. 8 S, 56 W) in southern Amazonia, in Rondonia, there seems
to have been a phase of very open savanna vegetation (95% grass pollen,
&lt;5% arboreal pollen) on a grey clay soil that has been radiocarbon
dated to around 18,500 yr. ago. (van der Hammen &amp; Absy 1994). This
pollen-bearing layer is overlain by 2-6m of a tough red clay that
closely resembles the present colluvial deposits of semi-arid seasonally
dry parts of the Brazilian Highlands. Thus, the vegetation at Katira at
the time the red clay was formed may have been a sparse, treeless
semi-arid grassland, not the moister savanna generally assumed for the
LGM period, which van der Hammen and Absy suggest was present at around
18,000 radiocarbon years ago (i.e. the LGM by the standard definition).
This in turn is followed by another grey clay layer bearing
predominantly grass pollen, indicating a return to somewhat moister
savanna conditions. On the basis of the evidence of a savanna phase, van
der Hammen (pers. comm. June 1992) suggests that during LGM conditions
there was about a 1000m lowering of rainfall, converting areas which at
present have rainfall below 2000 mm into savanna and savanna woodland,
but leaving a substantial core area of forest in central and western
Amazonia. However, considering the red clay layer, perhaps this
interpretation underestimates the full severity of the arid conditions
that occurred during (or perhaps just after) the LGM, for the red-clay
layer implies an even greater decrease in rainfall at around this time.
<p>

The radiocarbon date at Katira appears to eliminate the argument of
Colinvaux <u>et al</u>. (1989) that the lack of precise dating control
could just as well allow the savanna phase to have been a Holocene
event. They had suggested that the site is within 100 km of present-day
patches of savanna, occurring on sandstone massifs, and has a relatively
strongly seasonal climate for rainforest. Thus, in their view small
<i>Holocene</i> climate fluctuations could easily have allowed savanna
to expand over this site. Clapperton (1993) argues against a Holocene
age on the grounds that that it is most unlikely that such a thickness
of sediment could have accumulated during the Holocene under a
predominantly closed vegetation cover. It seems that both on
stratigraphic grounds and on the basis of the single radiocarbon date, a
very strong LGM-late glacial regression of rainforest in southern
Amazonia is incontrovertible. <p>

<p>

<i>North-western Amazonia</i>. Van der Hammen <u>et al</u>. (1992)
describe a section from the middle Caqueta River in the Colombian Amazon
lowlands, in the North-western Amazon (an area that presently has an
everwet rainforest climate). Pollen does not occur in the section that
includes the LGM (dated 26-13,000 <sup>14</sup>C years ago), but is
present in part of the section roughly dated to 70-40,000 years ago.
This earlier section shows savanna pollen and the pollen of trees
indicating drier vegetation types, suggesting an increase in semi-open
savanna-like vegetation during this earlier (lower Pleniglacial) glacial
time. By analogy with the lower Pleniglacial (previous glacial maximum)
and upper Pleniglacial (LGM) of the well-dated Carajas core this might
be taken to indicate that the pattern of savanna expansion during the
upper Pleniglacial (LGM) also extended to this area, albeit with only a
weak opening up of the forest. The Carajas core shows a stronger savanna
episode during the LGM interval than during the lower Pleniglacial
(around 70,000 years ago), and perhaps indicates that the general
pattern of dryness in the east would having extended across to western
Amazonia as well. However, this is a case of us 'clutching at straws',
for lack of any more conclusive evidence to discuss! </p>


<i>Zoological evidence of Amazonian last-glacial conditions</i>. If the
LGM rainforest area was in fact much less extensive than at present,
one would expect that the (now extinct) savanna grazing fauna of South
America would have been present in areas that are now occupied by
forest. Indeed, fossils of many species of savanna-adapted grazing
mammals (e.g. <i>Eremotherium, Toxodon, Palaeolama, Vicunga, Glyptodon,
Pampatherium, Mixotoxodon and Haplomastodon</i>) have been found at
exposures scattered along the rivers of western Amazonia. These include
sites in the upper Napo River catchment (approx. 1 S, 76 E), presently a
hypermoist area and postulated rainforest refugium. A larger number of
sites have been found in SW Amazonia (scattered between 8-12 S and 65-75
W) in the Jurua and Ucayali catchments, and well within the present
rainforest zone (Latrubesse &amp; Ramonell 1994, Rancy 1991). Other
animal fossils from the same sites are from species of riverine or
closed forest, which might suggest localised forest patches along rivers
in a mainly or partly open grassland environment. Rancy (1991) suggests
that at certain stages (probably late Quaternary glacial maxima,
according to him) the rainforest all across western Amazonia was
fragmented to leave savanna-forest mosaics or savanna with gallery
forest. Dating precision of the fossils is often poor and
circumstantial, with the position and form of the sediments suggesting a
late Quaternary age (Rancy 1991). Several southwestern Amazonia sites
have been radiocarbon dated to the period before about 37,000 years ago
(Latrubesse &amp; Rancy 1995), suggesting that there had been strong
rainforest regression <i>before</i> the LGM (a middle Pleniglacial date
is suggested by Latrubesse &amp; Rancy); whether this forest regression
recurred or continued up until the LGM seems uncertain from their
results. The fact that most South American grazing mammals became
extinct after the earliest Holocene certainly suggests that a Last
Glacial age for the aridity is more likely than a Holocene age. There is
clearly a need for further work on the age of these animal fossils, for
they could be crucial to an overall understanding of the stability of
the Amazon rainforest during the Quaternary. <p>

<p>

<p>

<i>Geomorphological evidence of glacial-age climates from Amazonia.</i>
There are various signs from geomorphology that conditions in the Amazon
Basin were very much drier during the LGM. Some of this evidence is
described below. Frustratingly however, there are no precise radiocarbon
dates to either prove or disprove these ideas, and as with some of the
fossil evidence the basis of these arguments must rest on the general
context in which the features are found. <p>

<b>  </b>
<b><p>

</b><i>Dune fields in the central Amazon; indicating past phases of
seasonal aridity?</i>  At some stage during the late Quaternary (not
necessarily the LGM), stabilized dunefields formed along the course of
the central and lower Amazon under seasonal river level conditions
(formed as river floodplain dunes and sand bars) resembling those of
present Orinoco River in a savanna climate (Iriondo &amp; Latrubesse
1994). Iriondo &amp; Latrubesse (1994) suggest that at the Last Glacial
Maximum there was a long, broad corridor of seasonally exposed dunes in
lower Amazon from about 60 deg.W to the river's mouth. In their
scenario, wind would have carried the sand and dust from seasonal river
bars and sedimentation into surrounding savanna, ultimately giving rise
to dune fields. <p>

<i>River downcutting in north-west Amazonia; indicator of aridity?</i>
Van der Hammen <u>et al</u>. (1992) describe a section from the Caqueta
River in north-western Amazonia (mentioned above). They find that there
was an episode of strong downcutting at some stage between 26,000 and
13,000 years ago. They suggest that this could have been caused by
aridity (but could lower sea level also be a cause?). A lower river
terrace was formed, with sediments lacking in organic matter - possibly
an indicator of relatively dry conditions, but this in itself preventing
radiocarbon dating. <p>

<p>
<P><i>Gravel deposits in western Amazonia suggesting greatly reduced riverine fluxes.</i>

Dumont et al. (1992) studied the deposits of three western Amazonian rivers to make inferences about the paleoclimate of western Amazonia. Gravel-size
sediment, up to ten times coarser that the present sandy deposits, is interpreted as indicating irregular fluvial regimes
during the Pleistocene glaciations. Paleofluvial morphology from the oldest parts of the Ucayali floodplain is
indicative of a discharge (at about 13000 years BP) 15% to 10% of that of the present river. A period of low
precipitation which occurred between 4600 and 1000 years BP has also been documented from paleosols and
sedimentary deposits. The high stage of the Tapiche river was lower than the present low stage.</P>

<p>

<i>Pebbles in western Amazonia</i>. Latrubesse &amp; Ramonell (1994)
report possible evidence of Amazon aridity; large pebbles (up to 10 cm
in diameter) were deposited by lowland rivers in the SW Amazon Basin.
Clapperton (1994) suggests that these indicate a combination of strong
precipitation events in the Andes and climatic aridity in lowlands,
reaching a maximum at LGM. </p>

<P><i>Braided-stream sediments in south-western Amazonia; deposited under
more seasonal conditions?</i> Clapperton (1993) summarises information
and opinion on a section at Beni, in the north of Bolivian Amazonia. He
suggests that coarse braided-stream sediments at the base of the section
indicate a much more seasonal climate than at present (only fine-grade
alluvium is accumulating at present, under much more gentle conditions).
Clapperton hypothesises that this seasonal rainfall regime occurred
before the beginning of the Holocene, during the glacial interval. </p>

<P>Clapperton (1993) has summarised data on geomorphological features
within the present rainforest area (some of which is referred to above)
that might be taken to indicate drier conditions and recession of
rainforest during the period which included the LGM. Although there is
no close dating control (a lack of LGM radiocarbon dates, for instance),
Clapperton argues on the basis of the stratigraphic context of these
features, and their possible correlation with indications of aridity
from other places within and outside Amazonia, that they are evidence of
a dramatic reduction in rainforest at the LGM. He suggests that the
widespread downcutting of the river under drier conditions of lower sea
level, would have produced an 'Amazon canyon' of incised rivers. The
resulting lowering of the water table on the lands between the river
courses would have further reduced rainforest cover by adversely
affecting its water balance, as would the lack of internal 'recycling'
of water by evapotranspiration. Thus, in a preliminary sketch map,
Clapperton (1993) suggests on the basis of present-day rainfall patterns
that there was a general replacement of forest by savanna or scrub at
the LGM, with the forest only surviving towards the centre and west of Amazonia and
also towards the east, with a large 'savanna corridor' between these two
areas. <p>

<p>

<i>Sediments in the Amazon 'delta'; an indicator of conditions
inland?</i> Large amounts of arkosic (feldspar-rich) sand turn up in the
Amazon submarine cone, deposited during glacial intervals. The presence
of feldspar fragments in Amazon delta sediments was initially taken by
Damouth &amp; Fairbridge (1970) as indicating dry conditions during the
glacial phase; however Irion (1984) has pointed out that the feldspars
cannot have come from surface soils of the low-lying Amazon Basin, as
required by the aridity hypothesis, because weathering from earlier
humid periods should have chemically removed feldspars from the land
surface before it became arid. Irion instead suggests that the feldspars
were derived from the Carajas area and from river downcutting due to the
fall in sea level. Damuth &amp; Fairbridge (1970) also suggested that
these could have been derived from the Guyana and Brazil Highlands, but
it was pointed out by Milliman <u>et al</u>. (cited by Clapperton 1993)
that these sediments might have been transported down from the Andes in
the west of Amazonia (perhaps indicating aridity in the east Andean
region?). At present, most of the Amazon sediment is derived from the
Andes. <p>

Furthermore Milliman <u>et al</u>. (cited and discussed in Clapperton
1993) suggested that the chemical maturity of many of the glacial-age
sediments that are derived from coastal rivers (not the Amazon itself)
indicates that strong chemical weathering on land had continued through
glacial intervals, thus indicating that conditions remained humid during
glacials. However, Clapperton (1993) points out that these coastal
rivers carry very little sediment under present conditions, because the
complete cover of rainforest prevents erosion. Thus, he suggests, an
opening up or loss of forest cover (under drier conditions) would have
been necessary to allow the stripping of the chemically weathered
materials originally formed under humid interglacial conditions. <p>

<p>

<i>Colinvaux's view of a moist and cool glacial Amazon region</i>. In
contrast to the fairly generally held view of large-scale forest
regression from the Amazon Basin during the LGM, Colinvaux and
colleagues have instead advocated that the Amazon region remained
predominantly moist. Colinvaux points out that the regions which show
evidence for either a general climatic drying or specifically a loss of
rainforest at around the last glacial period are either climatically
marginal for rainforest nowadays (e.g. Carajas) or are of an altogether
different and independent climate zone (e.g. Galapagos). At Mera, a site
at raised elevation in the Napo region of Ecuador (near the eastern edge
of Amazonia), Liu and Colinvaux (1987) have found pollen and wood
evidence of a moist no-analogue forest of Andean and rainforest elements
existing at 33,000 years ago and 26,000 years ago (radiocarbon dated),
under conditions at least 4 &#176;C cooler than today. Note that these
dates have since been strongly disputed by Heine 1994, who finds evidence that
the deposits are much older. At a site in southern Ecuador (Bush &amp;
Colinvaux 1989), in the foothills of the Condor Range, pollen and wood
evidence dated to 31,000 years ago and 26,000 years ago present a very
similar picture to the Mera site. <p>

It may be relevant to note here that hiatuses are present in
both of these Ecuador cores around 25,000-17,000 years ago. Whilst it is
necessary to be very cautious in interpreting an absence of data, the
lack of deposition might perhaps indicate some 'hidden' dry climatic
event  fitting into a pattern that other workers have suggested (pers.
obsv.n., based on discussion with various people working on the region).
A sedimentary hiatus occurs in many other places in South America at
around the LGM raising the suspicion that a coherent climatic pattern of
aridity was responsible, rather than simply local factors (M-P. Ledru,
pers. comm. June 1993). In other parts of the tropics (e.g. Australia,
Africa), a pattern of moist conditions around 30,000-25,000 years ago
was often followed by aridity around 20,000-18,000 radiocarbon years
ago. In SE Asia, montane ever wet sites do not seem to show
the drying and retreat of forest that occurred in adjacent lowlands.
On the other hand, if there was indeed a significant arid event in the western Amazon area at
around the LGM, it must have ended very rapidly to allow moist forest to
return to this site by 17,000 years ago when deposition resumes; this
must put some doubt on the hypothesis of aridity in this case at least. However, it will be necessary to 
bear in mind the substantial doubt which has now been placed on the age of one of the two west Amazon sites
by the dating reanalysis (mentioned above) carried out by Heine (1995). 
<p>

Widespread hiatuses and terminations in cores around and <i>within</i>
the lowlands of the Amazon Basin (rather than the raised elevation areas
that Colinveaux's team have been sampling) for the LGM period may
indicate rather more arid-than-present conditions in many places (pers.
comm. M-P. Ledru ORSTOM Sept. 1992). However, the lack of deposits
stretching back to the LGM may also be due to widespread river
downcutting due to the lower sea level at that time, and also the high
rate of reworking of floodplain sediments by the rivers (C. Clapperton
pers. comm. 1991). The central Amazonian cores of Colinvaux's group show
rainforest vegetation persisting through the LGM, but of course this
only shows for certain that the central Amazon remained forested, which
is really not a controversial issue (almost everyone working on South
America agrees that there would have been rainforest in the
<i>central</i> Amazon region at the LGM). What is more controversial
nowadays is how far the surrounding rainforest of the Amazon region
regressed. <p>

Rather than emphasising aridity as an influence on Amazon forests at the
LGM, Colinvaux and colleagues suggest that cooling was of great
importance. On the basis of the cooling indicated by forest
compositional changes at high and low altitudes in the Andes and central
America, Colinvaux suggests that what we might define as 'modern-day'
lowland rain forest was confined to below 500m or even 300m relative to
present sea level (pers. comm. April 1990). Forest at higher altitudes
than this would have been of a semi-temperate community of which there
is no modern analogue (Colinvaux pers. comm. May. 1990).<p>

It is difficult to gauge from his writings just how much
rainforest/moist forest Colinvaux has in mind for the LGM Amazon. It is
of interest to note, however, that Colinvaux's co-worker M.B. Bush has
recently published a map suggesting for sake of argument that an overall
20% reduction in rainfall be considered for the LGM Amazon (Bush 1994).
This would be enough to cause a significant retreat of rainforest,
causing for instance a broad NW-SE trending savanna corridor to open up
in eastern Amazonia. There would also be a significant loss of forest in
SW Amazonia. The actual loss of forest area is not as great, however, as
in other map reconstructions such as those published by Clapperton
(1993) and van der Hammen and Absy (1994) (see below). <p>


<P><A HREF="http://www.cptec.inpe.br/lba/Research.html">Recent research by Colinvaux's group is summarized in this linked web page</A>. 
They report unpublished work from the upper Rio Negro (central Amazonia), which shows no sign of savanna encroachment
during the last glacial (though some lowering of water levels). However, this is still within the area that most authors who advocate
a large-scale forest retreat would suggest as remaining as forest during the LGM period. Note that many other
authors suggest that the evidence of aridity and savanna encroachment in other areas of the Amazon Basin indicates a significant decrease in forest area
during the last glacial (with gallery and floodplain forests dominating the pollen flora that turns up in the Amazon fan). This issue will hopefully
be resolved more clearly over the next few years as more sites across the interior of Amazonia are located.</P>


<p>

<i>Van der Hammen and Absy's maps; a more drastic rainforest
retreat.</i> On the basis of the palynological and sedimentological
evidence, Van der Hammen and Absy come to the conclusion that a more
drastic reduction in rainfall of around 1000mm (a 40% decrease) would be
necessary to eliminate forest from all three of the Carajas, Katira and
Georgetown sites. Thus they suggest that if rainfall all across Amazonia
fell by the same absolute amount it would leave scattered pockets of
forest at the eastern coast and in southern Amazonia, and a large block
of forest surviving in western Amazonia. Based on both palynological and
sedimentological evidence of aridity, Clapperton (1993) also suggests in
the form of a sketch map a large reduction in LGM Amazon forest cover,
with a broad savanna corridor separating two main forest refugia in west
and east Amazonia respectively. Clapperton's distribution of forest
refugia is different from that suggested by Van der Hammen and Absy
(1994), and may be based on extrapolation from different present-day
rainfall maps (the actual mean rainfall distribution of rainfall across
Amazonia is still subject to large uncertainties due to the sparsity of
monitoring stations; P. Jones, University of East Anglia pers. comm.).
The simpler east-west rainfall gradient assumed by Clapperton appears to
be based on present-day rainfall maps similar to those given in recent
editions of the <i>Times World Atlas</i>. His general LGM scenario of a
central savanna corridor is followed here on the basis of my further
consideration of the distribution of sites, but with greater forest
cover to allow for the recent north-central Amazonian Rio Negro site
which apparently remained forested through the LGM. Assuming that
rainfall gradients were generally similar to the present distribution
(in the<i>Times Atlas</i> map) but at a different level, we have
tentatively suggested LGM survival of rain forest in those areas which
presently have above 1600mm annual rainfall.<p>

<p>

<u>The Mato Grosso</u>. <i>Desert conditions?</i> In the present
scrub/savanna region to the south of the Amazon forest, there are
abundant signs of past aridity, although it is not clear whether this
actually dates to the LGM. In the Patanal depression of the Mato Grosso
Plateau, stabilised dunes occur even where the rainfall exceeds 1200mm,
together with large alluvial fans and the remnants of clay or salt pans
(indicating surface wash from a sparsely vegetated landscape, with
periodic heavy storms such as occurs in semi-arid Australia at present).
Thomas (1994 p.251) notes Klammer's statement that the landscape appears
to be 'that of a desert come under the influence of a humid climate'.
Klammer himself considered these forms to be pre-Quaternary, but Thomas
(p.251) notes that Tricart and Ab'Saber have each suggested that they
were late Pleistocene (LGM) in age. Better dating constraint on these
deposits would be of considerable interest, to test whether or not they
are of glacial age and more especially LGM age. <p>

<p>

<u>Semi-arid Eastern Brazil</u>. <i>Substantial cooling</i>. Further
east, in the present dry semi-arid tropical grassland/scrub zone of
eastern Brazil (Piaui Province, 7 S, 41.5 W, 400m a.s.l.), noble gas
levels in ancient groundwater suggest that temperatures at the LGM were
5.4 +/- 0.6&#176;C cooler than during the late Holocene (Stute <u>et
al</u>. 1995). This fits in with the general pattern from elsewhere
across the American tropics. <p>

<p>

<u>Equatorial Andean region</u>. <i>Lowering of vegetation belts.</i> A
temperature depression of 6-8&#176;C, at above 2000m at 5N, in Colombia
is estimated from pollen data from Lake Sabana de Bogota (2550m a.s.l.),
in the plain of Bogota (e.g. Van der Hammen &amp; Gonzalez 1960,
Hooghiemstra 1984). For the Eastern Cordiellera of Colombia,
Hooghiemstra (1984) shows an LGM altitude profile based on extrapolating
the temperate changes inferred from these high altitude pollen cores to
the full range of altitudes (assuming the same lapse rate as today). In
his reconstruction, tropical forest reaches up to 500m (presently
1000m), subandean forest is in a belt at 500-1300m (presently
1000-2500m), Andean forest at 1300-2000m (2500-3300m), paramo at
2000-3000m (3300-4000m), alpine desert at 3000-3500m (4000-4500m) and
perennial snow above 3500m (presently above 4500m). <p>

Based on a combination of palynological and geomorphological data, Heine
(1995) suggests that in the Bolivian and Ecuadorian Andes, the
temperature depression above 4,200m a.s.l. was 4.8&#176;C relative the
present. This temperature depression is slightly less than the estimates
from the Colombian Andes, described above. <p>

<p>

<i>Drier than present on Inter Andean Plateau.</i> Pollen data from
sediments of a lake further to the south-west in the Ecuadorian
Interandean Plateau (Colinvaux <u>et al</u>. 1988) shows drier as well
as colder conditions than at present. The lowering the level of Lake
Fuquene in the eastern Cordillera of Colombia suggests that rainfall at
the LGM was at least 50% less than today (van der Hammen &amp; Absy
1994). Colinvaux (1993) suggests on this basis that there was a modest
increase in aridity in the adjacent Pacific coastal area as well. <p>

<p>

<i>But moister in the eastern cordillera of the Andes? </i>Colinvaux
(1993) notes in contrast, that the Bogota Lake referred to above shows a
'pluvial' pattern of higher water levels (moister climate) during
glacials than during interglacials. He suggests that as it is on the
eastern side of the Andes it is influenced by a separate climate system;
one indicative of the moist LGM conditions that would have extended
eastwards over lowland Amazonia. His pre-LGM submontane rainforest data
from western Amazonia are taken as fitting into this general pattern.
However, there appears to be a conflict with the pollen and lake level
data present for the same general area by van der Hammen's group, above.
<p>

<p>

<u>Subtropical South America.</u> <p>

<i>Dry grassland/shrubs instead of humid forest.</i> There is now some
pollen evidence relating to the present coastal belt of transitional
tropical rainforest and warm temperate forest of south-eastern Brazil. A
lowland site at Poco Grande (26 deg.25'S, 48 Deg.52'W, 8m a.s.l.) going
back to 14,000 <sup>14</sup>C y.a. shows substatially drier-than-present
conditions with only rare rainforest elements (<i>Alchornea</i>,
Urticales, Palmae) and an abundance of Myrtaceaeous trees (the latter
possibly only reflecting localized swamp conditions, rather than any
general forest cover) (Behling 1995). Conditions were perhaps even more
arid previous to this, during the period including the LGM, judging by
the possible timing of the aridity maximum shown for the adjacent
uplands (see below). Behling notes that it is not yet possible to know
whether a closed rain forest or merely scattered remnants persisted
further north along the coastal plain.  <p>

In tropical SE Brazil, Behling & Lichte (in press) find pollen evidence
of considerably cooler and drier conditions than present between about 48,000 and 17,000 14C y.a. (with a slight moistening of climate - indicated by slightly higher 
proportions of tree pollen - between 17,000 and 10,000
14C y.a.). This is at a site (20 deg.S, 43 deg.W)l, with the present vegetation being semi-deciduous forests and woodlands (present annual rainfall 1000-1500mm), 
replaced during the glacial period by grasslands with warm temperate trees existing only along rivers as gallery forests. A cooling of around 5-7 deg.C is suggested, with a movement of
temperature zones at least 750 km equatorwards, and general replacement of forests in the region by grasslands throughout the glacial period (Behling & Lichte, in press). </P>


<i>Arid and cold in the adjacent uplands</i>. <p>

Behling (1995) gives results of three cores from the uplands in SE
Brazil, scattered through the area between about 26-29 deg.S and 49-50
Deg.W. When deposition started at around 14,000 <sup>14</sup>C y.a.,
grassland (<i>campos</i>) predominated, with <i>Araucaria</i> apparently
very rare and confined to valleys. There are also various coarse slope
wash deposits constrained with varying degrees of precision by
radiocarbon dating to the period around the LGM, within the uplands
between about 22-20 S and 45-50 W (summarised by Clapperton 1993, and
Thomas 1994). Clapperton takes this evidence as indicating a sparsely
vegetated landscape, probably arid grassland, subject to episodic heavy
storms. <p>

<p>

<i>Dune fields in eastern Brazil?</i> Thomas (1994 p.258) mentions
Ab'Saber's recent work on dune fields in the Sao Francisco Valley
(around 45 W, 15 S) of eastern Brazil (presently savanna vegetation),
some 500 km south of the present north-eastern dry zone. Thomas mentions
that the age of the dunes is uncertain, but that 'they appear young and
probably relate to the LGM'. If this view is correct, the area would
seem likely to have had a semi-desert or desert vegetation, with sparse
ground cover. <p>

<p>

<i>Drier conditions in the subtropical woodland region</i>. In what is
presently the subtropical woodland region of south-central Brazil (19
S), the pollen-bearing LC3 core from Salitre (Ledru 1992) gives
indications of vegetation up to 25,000 years ago and since 17,000 years
ago, but with a hiatus in between. Ledru interprets the vegetation at
around 17,000 years ago as existing under drier conditions than at
present, with less forest vegetation than during the Holocene (high
levels of arboreal pollen in her core are interpreted as being due to a
localised expansion of Myrtaceae on the exposed lake bed, rather than a
general expansion in forest cover), although at the time of most recent communication she felt that the data were
not sufficient to allow her to know just how much forest cover there was
generally in that region, because Salitre is the only dated core in this
part of Brazil so it might not be representative of that region in
general (Ledru pers. comm. 1993), although other more
recently obtained cores from Behling (see above) confirm a general pattern of greater aridity. Nor is it possible to know what the
LGM vegetation was like at this site. A decrease in sediment grain size
towards the hiatus that occurs around the LGM is suggestive of decreased
stream runoff, perhaps reflecting drier conditions (Ledru pers. comm.
May 1994).  This seems to fit in with the general pattern of
more arid conditions across all or most of SE Brasil, which
is suggested from the recently obtained cores of Behling and colleagues (see above) in the forest regions
nearer to the coast.<p>

Colinvaux (pers. comm. June 1993) mentions the unpublished 1992 thesis
of De Oliveira, with a continuous record from the south-eastern cerrados
area, at Minas Geras, stretching back to well before the LGM. This area
now has scrubby cerrados vegetation, but during most of the glacial
Colinvaux (pers. comm. 1993) reports that the climate was apparently
moister and cooler. Although Colinvaux does not specify in his letter
whether the LGM itself was moister and cooler, or just the phase
preceding it, the implication is that conditions at this site were
indeed relatively moist at the LGM. Note however that Clapperton
summarises an array of geomorphological evidence of sand dunes, dune
fields and blowouts from the southern Cerrados region, and suggests
extensive sand desert at the LGM for the area bordered by the Beni Basin
in the north and the Pantanal in the east, and the northern Cerrados
region in the south. <p>

<p>

<i>Retreat of Araucaria forest in SE Brazil</i>. Another site from the
SE Brazilian highlands within the present <i>Araucaria </i>forest zone,
at Morro de Itapeva (22 deg.47'S, 45 deg.32'W), 1850 m a.s.l., suggests
markedly cooler and drier than present conditions up until about 17,000
<sup>14</sup>C y.a. (Behling in press). High-elevation grasslands
predominated, and <i>Arauacaria</i> forest elements were rare.
Conditions apparently ameliorated somewhat after 17,000 y.a.<p>

<p>

<i>Drier vegetation in the sub-equatorial Andes</i>. In the central
Peruvian Andes at 11 S, palynological evidence from Laguna Junin shows
that the present Andean forests were poorly represented there and that
sub-puna shrublands took their place, presumably due to cooler and drier
conditions than at present (Villagran 1990, Markgraf 1993). <p>

<p>

<i>Replacement of forest by savanna</i>. In the extreme north-east of
Argentina (Misiones Province), pollen evidence indicates that instead of
the sub-tropical rainforest vegetation that now covers the hills there
was a savanna vegetation (Iriondo &amp; Garcia 1993; citing a 1985
reference in Spanish by Rizzo). Whether this was relatively dry or moist
savanna is not specified. If this relatively high rainfall area had
suffered such a reduction in rainfall, surrounding areas that are drier
than this must also have been affected, having correspondingly drier
vegetation than occurs today. <p>

Stevaux (1994) reports the preliminary results of palynological studies
of the Upper Parana River, Porto Rico site at the southern end of the
broadleaf subtropical forest zone (22 deg.S, 53 deg.W), and compares
these results with those of other pollen sites nearby. During the late
Glacial the zone was apparently dominated by savannas and grasslands
instead of forest. Geomorphological evidence also indicates aridity;
there was a braided river system and colluviation. Stevaux suggests
savanna vegetation possibly persisting until around 6,000 y.a.<p>

Loess deposition occurred across Santa Fe and South-western Entre Rios,
which Irondo &amp; Garcia suggest as indicating much drier conditions
than at present. Iriondo &amp; Garcia suggest a north-easterly movement
of the present climate isoclines by about 750 km under LGM conditions
(see below). This would correspondingly roughly to a northward shift of
the zones by 6 Latitude, and bring temperate semi-desert conditions over
most of northern Argentina. <p>

<p>

<b><p>

</b><i>Desert and semi-desert in Chaco</i>. Further to the west, in the
western Chaco plain (northern Argentina and Paraguay) that lies next to
the Andes, the LGM climate was dry enough to allow mobilisation and then
deposition of aeolian sand and loess. Clapperton (1993) reviews the
evidence of dunes and blowouts in this area, and also the area to the
north of the Chaco (in southern Bolivia, W. Paraguay and N. Argentina),
where he reconstructs sand desert for the LGM. On adjacent areas to the
south-east, a thick loess built up during the last glacial, covering the
whole plain from the flank of the Andes as far as 60W. Animal fossil
evidence suggests a dry steppe or semi-desert environment in this loess
belt (Iriondo &amp; Garcia 1993). Estimates of discharges from the
palaeochannels of westward flowing the rivers in this plains region
indicate flows that were only about 20% of present levels (Iriondo &amp;
Garcia 1993).  <p>

<p>

<u>Patagonia and the south of the Andes.</u> <p>

<i>Frigid, dry conditions at the southern tip.</i> In the high southern
latitudes of South America, ice sheets or ice caps were present along
the Andes, spreading down onto the plains and coasts below. The
surrounding vegetation in this most southerly part of the peninsula (at
around 45 - 51S) seems to have been a windy dry heath-like
steppe-tundra, existing under a cold climate with low precipitation
(Heusser 1987, V. Markgraf pers. comm. 1993).  <p>

<p>

<i>Replacement of Andean mediterranean zone by steppe woodland.</i>
Further north, west of the Andes at Laguna Tagua Tagua (at about 34 S),
steppe vegetation (with some evergreen <i>Nothofagus</i> trees present)
existed over at least part of the area now occupied by
mediterranean-type sclerophyll woodland (Heusser 1983). There is no sign
of closed forest persisting in the area; the vegetation at this locality
seems to have been an 'open evergreen forest' according to Markgraf
(1989) or 'steppe woodland' as Heusser describes it, with similarities
to the open woody vegetation that occurs near the forest limit in the
mountains today. In a sketch map drawn for us by C. Heusser (pers. comm,
1990), a park tundra grading northward into steppe-woodland is shown
between about 40 and 30S. <p>

<p>

<i>Atacama desert persisting?</i> Meanwhile, what survived of the
Chilean mediterranean vegetation had moved further equatorwards. The
most northerly extension of the Chilean mediterranean vegetation during
the last glacial seems to have been about 30 S, with localised presence
of sclerophyll taxa in coastal ravines at that time (Villagran 1990).
Further to the north of this, the continuing presence of the Pacific
coastal/montane Atacama Desert through both warm and cold periods of the
Quaternary is supported by present-biogeographical evidence; the
physiognomically similar altiplanic and mediterranean floras of northern
and central Chile remain floristically very distinct, suggesting that
the aridity barrier between them has remained unbroken for millions of
years (Villagran 1990). Clapperton (1993) suggests that the desert belt
would also have extended further north along the coast that at present,
in line with the indications of generally more arid conditions elsewhere
along the Pacific edge of South America. <p>

<p>

<i>The Chilean temperate rainforest zone; did it disappear?</i> Further
south along by the Pacific coast (approximately in the zone depicted by
the Heussers as park tundra at the LGM), at Isla Chiloe (42S),
conditions in what are presently the evergreen temperate rainforest belt
also seem to have been wetter than now, with replacement by the
hyperhumid magellanic moorland down to sea level (Villagran 1988). It
thus seems that some aspects of the vegetation zones presently in this
area were shifted by at least 5 latitude equatorwards at the LGM, with
the moorland vegetation descending in altitude at least 600m relative to
its present lower limit. However, it seems, according to the Heussers,
that the temperate evergreen rainforest (in its various forms) did not
shift correspondingly northwards in this way, but was lost as a
vegetation unit. Localised forest tree refugia were probably present, in
the form of woodland with steppe (L. Heusser pers. comm. 1990) between
about 35 and 48S. Markgraf (1991) instead presents a map in which the
area 40-35S that the Heussers depict as 'park tundra' and
'steppe-woodland' is described as '<i>Nothofagus dombeyi</i>' woodland.
Note that there is no mention of any areas of surviving 'forest'
vegetation in Markgraf's reconstruction. As Markgraf's (1991) work is
the most recent, I have here based the map reconstruction here mainly on
her published maps. <p>

Note however that the reconstruction of Villagran (1990) disagrees with
this view of a complete loss of the west Andean temperate evergreen
forests; her diagrams show large areas of evergreen forests persisting
further north than their present ranges. This is based on her
interpretation of increased rainfall further north due to a shift in the
westerly winds (see below), on the basis of the same pollen evidence
(summarized by Markgraf 1993) that the Heussers and Markgraf have been
citing. <p>

<p>

<i>Was precipitation in southern Chile greater at the LGM?</i> There is
some disagreement over the extent to which precipitation and/or moisture
availability might have increased relative to the present at the LGM in
some areas of southern Chile. Heusser (1983) and Villagran (1989)
advocate a precipitation increase caused by a northwards shift of the
rain-bearing wind belt. However, Markgraf (1989) is more in favour of
relatively greater LGM aridity in many areas and no significant increase
in precipitation in other areas. She suggests that cooling of climate
promoted the growth of ice caps and favoured moister conditions in some
areas of the lowlands simply due to decreased evaporation. However,
according to Villagran (1989) there may have been a very substantial
increase in precipitation (at least 1500mm) over the area where
magellanic moorland formed at the LGM. She suggests a temperature
decrease of about 4&#176;C relative to the present, whilst Markgraf
(1989) suggests a cooling of 6&#176;C for the general area of southern
Chile. <p>

<p>

<i>Eastern side of the Andes; drier than present conditions in
Patagonia, the pampas and adjacent areas</i>.  In an extensive review of
the palaeoevidence of this region, Iriondo and Garcia (1993) suggest a
very substantial drying and cooling over this whole region, stretching
down into Patagonia. Precipitation and temperature isoclines seem to
have been some 750 km to the north-east of their present positions. <p>

<p>

<b></b>In central Argentina the mean annual temperature may have been
around 2.5-3&#176;C lower, with the difference in winter (4&#176;C)
being greater than in summer (1&#176;C), according to Iriondo &amp;
Garcia (1993). They report that rainfall generally seems to have been
about half of what it is today (although it is not clear whether the
temperature decrease has been allowed for in this calculation). In
contrast, Thomas (1994 p.217) cites the evidence of Gonzales that after
17,500 years ago the level of Lake Salina del Bebeder (33S, Argentina)
was high. However, Thomas does not mention whether or not the lake level
indicates aridity actually at the LGM itself. <p>

Iriondo &amp; Garcia suggest in their climate-zone maps that the
north-east of Argentina remained 'subhumid' through the LGM, although
they do not specify what sort of vegetation would have been associated
with this.<p>

  <p>

<i>Desert in the pampa</i>. In what are presently the 'pampa' dry
grassland areas of western Argentina, periglacial silts and sands washed
down from the Andes were blown away to form a sand sea covering the
south-western half of the Pampa, indicating that there may have been
almost no vegetation (Iriondo &amp; Garcia 1993). The LGM sand sea
extended between 38 and 33 deg.S (Latrubesse &amp; Ramonell 1994) and
included large longitudinal dunes more than 100 km long (Ramonell <u>et
al</u>. 1992). <p>

To the east, large areas of loess acumulated north to 30 deg.S. This
loess was deposited in a semi-desert environment, (derived from the
desert areas in the west) and covered over the pre-existing drainage
system of the plains (Latrubesse &amp; Ramonell 1994).  <p>

<p>

<i>Absence of forests on the eastern edge of the Andes</i>. On the
eastern (Argentine) side of the temperate evergreen zone of the Andes at
37-42S, areas that are now covered with high or low elevation evergreen
beech forests were dominated before 12,000 years ago by non-arboreal
pollen and only minor amounts of xeric trees and shrubs, presumably due
to aridity (Markgraf 1989). Markgraf suggests, on the basis of this
palaeovegetation pattern observed from west to east across the Andes,
that the precipitation gradient was even greater than today's. <p>

<p>

<i>Northward movement of Patagonian vegetation</i>. To the north-east,
in what is presently the semi-desert scrub zone of Argentina (south of
the Chacos), at a site 100km east of the Andes (34S), a Patagonian
semi-desert flora of herbs and grasses seems to have been present,
associated with a cool, dry climate (Markgraf 1989). <p>

<p>

<p>

<u>8,000 years ago (early Holocene).<p>

</u><p>

<u>Central America.</u> <p>

<i>Forests in place</i>. In Central America, forest lines had risen to
their present altitudes before 8,000 years ago (Hooghiemstra <u>et
al</u>. 1992). At Chalco Lake in the high altitude plateau of central
Mexico, temperate montane forest had replaced the earlier grasslands
before 9,000 y.a. (Lozano-Garcia <u>et al</u>. 1993). In the Peten
region of Guatemala, conditions became moister before the start of the
Holocene but the expansion of tropical forest elements seems to have
been accompanied by persistence of some temperate tree taxa until about
9,000 years ago. By 8,000 years ago the present tropical semi-deciduous
forest had fully returned to the Peten region of Guatemala, and
persisted throughout the Holocene (Leyden <u>et al</u>. 1993). Colinvaux
(pers. comm, Aug. 1993) suggests on the basis of his pollen cores that
there may have been drier-than-present conditions in lowland Panama
during the early Holocene. <p>

<p>

<i>Significant human disturbance?</i> Piperno <u>et al</u>. (1990) point
to an abrupt increase in charcoal fluxes and pollen of 'weedy' species
in Lake Yeguda, Panama, in the early Holocene (11,000 years ago) as
indicating the onset of deliberate disturbance by either cultivators or
hunter gatherers. Colinvaux (1993) suggests that this may indicate a
significant role of human disturbance in the forests throughout this
period. However, agricultural impact may have been very limited. Maize
pollen does not begin to appear in pollen diagrams before about 6,000
years ago. <p>

<p>

<u>Northern coast of South America</u>. <i>Moister than present in
Venezuelan highlands</i>. In cores from Lake Valencia in the Venezuelan
highlands, moist tropical forest was present in the earlier Holocene,
whilst the area today has a markedly more seasonal climate
(Salgado-Labourieu 1977, Colinvaux 1987). <p>

<p>

<u>Amazonia.</u> <p>

<i>Forest in west-central Amazonia. </i>Lake cores from the
western-central Amazon show that the forest there has been in place
since at least 7,000 years ago, which is as far back as the cores go
(Colinvaux pers. comm.), which at least does not contradict the view
that it would already have returned by 8,000 years ago. The slow rise in
the nitrate level in the Andean Huascaren Glacier core (Thompson <u>et
al</u>. 1995) suggests that Amazonian forest (a major source of nitrate,
as opposed to savanna which is not) did not in fact reach its maximum
extent until the mid-Holocene, although nitrate levels were already much
higher than during the last Glacial by early Holocene time. The view of
a delay in forest colonisation fits in with some of the palynological
evidence reviewed below. <p>

<p>

<i>Forested, but drier in eastern Amazonia.</i> In the eastern Amazon
area, the core CSS2 from the plateau of Southern Serra dos Carajas (Absy
<u>et al</u>. 1991), shows drier-than-present conditions around 8,000
years ago, correlative with a reduction in Amazon River discharge. An
increase in savanna elements occurs at this time. This early-to-mid
Holocene dryness is also observed in other parts of South America; in
Brazil (Servant <u>et al</u>. 1989) and in the high Andean lake
Titicaca, in Bolivia (Wirrmann <u>et al</u>. 1988). <p>

However, the overall forest cover might not have been much different
from the present-potential; a recently obtained lake core (Sifeddine
<u>et al</u>. 1994, manuscript submitted) also on the Serra dos Carajas
plateau in the rainforest region of the eastern Amazon (Brazil) shows
that at 8,000 years ago the area was about as forested as at present,
with a mainly evergreen rainforest cover. The forest here did not reach
this climax state until around 9,500 years ago (strongly lagging the
lake level rise, which began around 13,000 years ago, and showing an
abundance of early successional species for several thousand years).
Behling (1995) reports that during the lower Holocene and late Glacial,
an 'unknown ecosystem' rich in <i>Ilex</i> with some <i>Podocarpus</i>
occurred in the east Amazon coastal area, though he does not state until
what time during the Holocene this no-analogue community persisted. He
also reports human disturbance (charcoal layers) from closed forest at
the Amazon mouth starting at around 10,000 years ago. <p>

 <p>

<i>Forest line in Andes.</i> The work of van der Hammen suggests that
the highest forest limit in the equatorial Andes was reached after 8,000
years ago (indicating a maximum in temperature perhaps 1 or 2&#176;C
higher than today), with some drop towards modern times. <p>

<p>

<i>Moister in Atacama Altiplano? </i>The upland coastal high desert of
Peru and Chile, (extending between 18 and 28 S at present) seems to have
been greatly reduced by higher rainfall at some stage during the late
glacial or early Holocene. Precipitation at present is well under 200mm,
but according to loosely dated glacial and lake sediments it would have
exceeded 500mm, reducing the desert to a zone between 25 and 28 S
(Grosjean &amp; Messerli 1995). However, they also find indications that
by the mid-Holocene, conditions were even more arid than at present.
<p>

<p>

<u>The South American subtropics.</u> <p>

 <p>

<i>Moister than today's climates, after a late switch from aridity</i>.
In Beunos Aries province of eastern Argentina (about 35S) and in the
Cordoba uplands at about 30S in the west of Argentina, the climate seems
only to have switched from glacial aridity to Holocene moistness at
around 8,500 years ago, according to sedimentological, archaeological
and zoological evidence cited by Iriondo &amp; Garcia (1993). The same
wide range of sources of evidence suggest conditions that were
strikingly moister than today's at 8,000 years ago, and throughout the
mid Holocene. <p>

<p>

<i>A subtropical forest expansion?</i> <p>

In south-central Brazil, semi-deciduous forest predominated in the area
of the Salitre core of Ledru (1992). The presence of <i>Araucaria</i>
forest up until 8,000 years ago suggests the absence of a dry season
(Vernat <u>et al</u>. 1994). Around 8,000 years ago, winter temperature
(from ostracods &amp; diatoms) seems to have been about 7&#176;C, or
2-3&#176;C cooler than today, and moister with only a short dry season,
with the conifer <i>Araucaria</i> as a dominant component in the forest
cover. <p>

<p>

<i>But less forest in other areas</i>. Drier-than-present conditions -
with less forest than during the late Holocene - may have existed in the
subtropical forest area of SE Brazil from after about 8,000 years ago
until about 3,000 years ago, indicated by charcoal phases followed by
savanna incursion (Vernet <u>et al</u>. 1994). Other evidence of more
arid than present conditions at the 8,000 y.a. timeslice comes from  a
pollen record at Lago do Pires; 17 deg.57'S,  42 deg. 13'W (Behling
1995b). A herb savanna seems to have predominated, with gallery forests
in the valleys, in contrast with the latest Holocene when closed
semideciduous forest covered the whole area. Thus, the maps
reconstruction I have given here, with expanded early and mid Holocene
forest in SE Brazil, may be incorrect. <p>

<p>

<i>But much more humid further south?</i> Iriondo &amp; Garcia suggest
that from 8,000 years ago to 3,500 years ago the humid subtropical
forest climate that is now present only in the extreme north-east of
Argentina would have covered much of north-eastern Argentina, from just
north of Buenos Aries eastwards, across Uruguay. Thus in the north-east,
precipitation seems to have been around double what it is today (Iriondo
&amp; Garcia 1993), which would give totals of more than 1600mm. <p>

Note however that there are indications of various dry periods, with
slope wash deposits, during the Holocene (see discussion by Thomas 1994,
p.254-255). The timing and duration of these episodes is unknown. <p>

<p>

<i>Woodland/forest in the Argentinean central region?</i> Likewise,
subtropical humid conditions extended south-westwards; near the coast at
Cipoletti, 39S and 60W, annual precipitation seems to have been about
five times its present amount (at that time having a 7-month wet
season), with a mean temperature about 1.8&#176;C warmer than today's
(the greatest difference being in the winter temperature) (Iriondo &amp;
Garcia 1993). This would presumably have been associated with widespread
forest or woodland cover (my reconstruction) in this central and
northern belt of Argentina, which is presently semi-arid and lacking a
dense vegetation cover. As an example, at the southern edge of this
extended zone, a lake pollen core at 35S 58W showed the existence of a
humid steppe with rainforest elements 8,500-4,000 years ago; presumably,
forest cover would have been increased north-eastwards of this site.
Over the same period, an essentially Brazilian subtropical mammal fauna
extended south to 38 'and probably further' (Iriondo &amp; Garcia 1993).
<p>

<p>

<i>Moist steppe in the west.</i> In the western part of Argentina, north
of Patagonia (about 38S) and in the 200-300km wide belt east of the
Andes (north to about 25S) , there seem to have been humid enough
climates for widespread formation of 'black earth' soils that survive
where they were buried by later Holocene windblown sediments (and in
some places as relict surface soils). These soils were presumably
originally associated with a rich steppe vegetation. This is in areas
that have presently have only a sparse vegetation cover and little or no
soil development (Iriondo &amp; Garcia 1993). <p>

<p>

 <i>Patagonia staying arid.</i> Markgraf considers that the area south
 of 50S stayed in an arid mode, but with a woodland
 vegetation, until after 9,000 years ago (Markgraf 1992), and perhaps as
 late as 8,000 years ago (Markgraf 1992). At latitudes between 50 and 55
 S, the postglacial forest expansion seems to have started at around
 9,000 years ago in the west, and to have reached over to the east side
 of the Andes by 8,000 years ago (Markgraf 1992). After this, moister
 conditions, slightly warmer than today's (with a continuing spread of
 <i>Nothofagus</i> beech forest) set in gradually during the
 early-to-mid Holocene (Heusser 1990). However, for the extreme southern
 tip of South America, essentially modern vegetation distributions from
 around 13,000 years ago onwards have been reported (e.g. Villagran
 1990).  <p>

<p>

<p>

<u>5,000 <sup>14</sup>C years ago</u>.<p>

<u>Amazonia.</u> <i>Arid episodes and wildfire.</i> Colinvaux (1987)
suggests the possibility of a dry mid-Holocene phase of rainforest
regression and replacement by savanna, occurring intermittently during
the interval 7,000-4,000 <sup>14</sup>C years ago. Various short-lived
episodes of aridity and of wildfire have been documented in pollen
diagrams (Carajas and Matto Grosso) and charcoal layers (Venezuelan
Amazon) have been found for the mid-to-late Holocene, apparently
antedating the arrival of Amerindians in these particular sub-regions. A recently published study also
suggests similar drought and fire episodes for central Amazonia (near Manaus) between 5,000 to 7,000 years ago (Piperno & Becker 1996), without
any indicators that these were caused by cultivation. 
However, there does not seem to be evidence that any single arid phase
lasting for more than 50 years, and most seem to have been much shorter
(Colinvaux 1987), though Thomas &amp; Thorp (1992) report that Markgraf
has found lake level evidence for an arid phase lasting several hundred
years at around 6,000 years ago in tropical America. Suguio <u>et
al</u>. (1993) discuss the evidence for dry phases in the 7,000-4,000
year ago interval on the basis of the Serra dos Carajas core at 6 S, 50
E in Eastern Amazonia. At this site, rainforest regression seems to have
occurred in the form of frequent dry episodes (marked by charcoal
fragments) alternating with times of partial forest recovery with high
percentages (&gt;40%) of the pioneer vegetation genus <i>Piper</i>. At
the Carajas site, savanna does not seem to have had any time to encroach
between times of forest pioneer influx, suggesting that the drought
episodes were severe but short-lived. <p>

<p>

<u>Central America</u>.<p>

<i>Agriculture not yet important as a disturbance factor?</i> At 5,000
years ago (and as early as 7,000 years ago), agriculture seems to have
existed in the Central American region but does not seem to have been an
important influence on the vegetation. In the forested Peten lowlands of
Guatemala, Binford <u>et al</u>. (1987) find initial increases in
erosion and decreases in tree pollen only after around 3,000 years ago.
Markgraf (1993) suggests that widespread agricultural disturbance in
Central America occurred only after about 3,500 years ago. Similarly,
Piperno (1994) finds that for various sites in lowland Panama, forest
disturbance by humans was very minor and sporadic up until around 4,000
years ago, after which major forest loss began to occur. In a
contrasting environment, in the uplands of central Mexico (Basin of
Mexico), large scale deforestation by humans apparently occurred only
after 3,000 y.a. (Lozano-Garcia <u>et al</u>. 1993).  <p>

<p>

<u>Sub-tropical South America</u>. <p>

<i>Mire development commencing</i>. Heusser (1990) finds relatively
cool, mesic conditions similar to the present beginning with the
development of beech forest and mires starting around 5,000 years ago,
in a core in southern Tierra del Fuego (55S). <p>

<p>

<i>Warmer and moister than today in some areas, but drier in others? <p>

</i>Iriondo and Garcia (1992) find evidence of conditions still having
been moister than at present, at 5,000 years ago being much as they were
at 8,000 years ago, with a large north-eastward displacement relative to
the present vegetation. <p>

However conditions might have been drier than today, further to the
north. For the subtropical forest area of south-eastern Brazil at
Salitre (Suguio <u>et al</u>. 1993), there was a minimum in tree pollen
(to around 10% of the total; the present tree pollen % for this woodland
site is around 15%) at around 5,000 years ago, indicating a longer dry
season than at present. The presence of charcoal and savanna grasses
further reinforce the view that conditions were substantially drier than
at present. Hence on further consideration, the map reconstruction here
showing an expanded area of subtropical forest is likely to be
incorrect. Using various bio-indicators, winter mean temperature is
estimated to have been around 5&#176;C higher than the present value of
10&#176;C (Suguio e<u>t al</u>. 1993). <p>

There is an apparent contrast between the pattern of seasonally drier
conditions to the north, and the indications of moister-than-present
conditions in Argentina. Thus, Iriondo &amp; Garcia (1993) suggest that
in Argentina and adjacent areas, conditions at 5,000 years ago were much
moister and slightly warmer than today, with the vegetation-climate
boundaries similar to those at 8,000 years ago (see above). <p>

<p>

<i>Drier than present in the Chilean Andes. </i>At subtropical
latitudes, three high-altitude lakes in Northern Chile (respectively 18
S, 27 S &amp; 23 S) show a pattern of mid-Holocene dryness, based on
isotope studies of ostracodes (Schwalb &amp; Burns 1995). The dry
episode is suggested to be between about 7,000 and 4,000 years ago,
perhaps linked to persistent 'El Nino' events. The spatial extent of the
aridity is not known, and it contrasts with the indications of moister
conditions in Argentina (see above). <p>
