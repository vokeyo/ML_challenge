        , long ago, before there were people, there was hardly anything in the 
        world but water. One day, Great Spirit looked down from heaven. He decided 
        to make a beautiful land. But where could he begin? All he saw was water. 
        Then he spotted a giant turtle. Great Spirit decided to make the beautiful 
        land on the turtle&#146;s back. </p>
      <p>But one turtle was not big enough. The land that the Great Spirit wanted 
        to make was very large. So he called out, &quot;Turtle, hurry and find 
        your six brothers.&quot; </p>
      <p>Turtle swam away to find them. It took her a whole day to find the first. 
        It took another day to find the next. After six days, Turtle had found 
        her six brothers. &quot;Come,&quot; she said. &quot;The Great Spirit wants 
        us.&quot; </p>
      <p><img src="/kids/images/word_great.gif" alt="Great" width="85" height="36"> 
        Spirit called down. &quot;Turtles! Form a line, all of you -- head to 
        tail, north to south. Umm -- you have three on the south, please move 
        a little to the east. Hmmm. Yes, that&#146;s just right. What a beautiful 
        land you turtles will make! Now listen! It is a great honor to carry this 
        beautiful land on your backs. So you must not move!&quot; </p>
      <p>The turtles stayed very still. Great Spirit took some straw from his 
        supply in the sky. He spread it out on the turtle&#146;s backs. Then he 
        took some soil and patted it down on top of the straw. </p>
      <p><img src="/kids/images/word_great.gif" alt="Great" width="85" height="36"> 
        Spirit cleaned his hands on a fluffy white cloud. Then he went to work, 
        shaping mountains and valleys and lakes and rivers. When he was finished, 
        he looked at the beautiful land he had made. Great Spirit was very pleased. 
        But soon trouble began. The giant turtles grew restless. They wanted to 
        stretch their legs. </p>
      <p>&quot;I want to swim east,&quot; said one. </p>
      <p>&quot;I want to swim west, with the setting sun,&quot; said another. 
      </p>
      <p><img src="/kids/images/word_the.gif" width="74" height="38" alt="The"> 
        turtles began to argue. They could not agree which way to move. One day, 
        four of the turtles began to swim east. The others began to swim west. 
        The Earth shook! It cracked with a loud noise. But after a minute, the 
        shaking stopped. The turtles had to stop moving because the land on their 
        backs was so heavy. They had only been able to swim a little way from 
        each other. When they saw that they could not swim away, they stopped 
        arguing and made up. </p>
      <p>Every once in a while, though, the turtles argue again. Each time they 
        do, the Earth shakes! </p>
