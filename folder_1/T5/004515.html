<p>The vehicle was carrying two passengers when it breached the highway barrier and plunged an estimated 30 feet down a steep embankment, trapping both victims in the wreckage.&nbsp; Upon arrival, MDFR crews immediately began a difficult extrication in deep, muddy terrain, as Air Rescue was dispatched to the scene in preparation for patient transport to the Trauma Center.</p>

<p>The first victim removed from the vehicle was an adult male, who was already deceased, and another adult victim was still being extricated by the Technical Rescue Team as weather conditions continued to deteriorate and Air Rescue remained on standby near the scene.&nbsp; The helicopter crew was just minutes from being forced to cancel air transport due to the incoming hazardous weather, when the victim was finally freed from the vehicle and rushed to the landing zone for immediate transfer to the Trauma Center.</p>

<p>In all, over 25 Miami-Dade firefighters contributed to this complicated rescue effort. Portions of several major highways, including the Palmetto and Gratigny Expressways, were shut down temporarily while police and fire personnel managed the emergency.&nbsp; According to the Florida Highway Patrol, as of 11:00 p.m. tonight, all roads affected by this incident have been reopened. The cause of this crash is still under investigation.&nbsp;</p>
