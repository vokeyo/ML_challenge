<P><FONT FACE="Courier"></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">	BOUDIN, <U>Circuit Judge</U>.  This appeal is the latest
installment in a series growing out of New Hampshire's efforts
to deregulate the electric utility industry and trim rates for
customers.<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Familiarity with our prior decisions is assumed. 
We repeat here only those facts pertinent to the present issue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Connecticut Valley Electric Company ("Connecticut
Valley"), a small New Hampshire utility, provides retail
electric service to about 10,000 customers in New Hampshire. 
Connecticut Valley purchases about 76 percent of its power from
its parent company, Central Vermont Public Service Corporation
("Central Vermont"), a Vermont utility, under a wholesale
requirements contract ("the RS-2 contract") that incorporates
cost-of-service rates ("the RS-2 rate schedule") filed with and
regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). 
Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont have had a requirements
contract incorporating some form of the RS-2 rate schedule since
1982. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	The RS-2 contract has a termination clause that, read
literally, permits either party to terminate the contract at the
end of a service year by giving written notice of termination
before the beginning of that service year.  <U>See</U> <U>Patch V</U>, 167
F.3d at 32.  Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont contend that
the termination clause was not intended to give either of them
the ability to terminate unilaterally on such short notice, but
the district court found it unnecessary to decide whether the
one-year termination clause allows Connecticut Valley to
terminate on the specified notice if and when its own interests
so dictate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Central Vermont's rates under the RS-2 contract with
Connecticut Valley are higher than the current rates for
wholesale electricity available elsewhere in New Hampshire, due
in part to an expensive long-term contract by which Central
Vermont purchases from Hydro Quebec.  In February 1997, as part
of its restructuring of electricity regulation in New Hampshire,
the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission ("the Commission")
found that Connecticut Valley should have given notice of
termination of its RS-2 contract on or before December 31, 1996. 
This finding was made in computing the so-called "stranded cost
recovery charge" that Connecticut Valley would otherwise be
allowed to recover from customers as part of the deregulation
process.  <U>Re Connecticut Valley Elec. Co.</U>, Order No. 22,509
(Feb. 28, 1997) (the "Stranded Cost Recovery Order").<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Concerned that Connecticut Valley would terminate the
RS-2 contract and thereby leave Central Vermont alone with a
long-term obligation to buy expensive power from Hydro Quebec,
Central Vermont in June 1997 filed with FERC its own proposal to
terminate the RS-2 contract.  However, it made termination
contingent on FERC allowing Central Vermont to add a "stranded
cost surcharge" on power delivered over its transmission lines
to customers in Connecticut Valley's service area.  FERC
rejected that proposal as inconsistent with earlier FERC orders
and regulations, but decided to allow Central Vermont to file a
different plan that would impose an exit fee on Connecticut
Valley at the contract's termination, and thus ensure that
Connecticut Valley shared in the loss to Central Vermont that
would result from termination of the contract.  <U>See</U> <U>Central Vt.
Pub. Serv. Corp.</U>, 81 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,336, at 62,543 (1997), <U>aff'd</U>,
--F.3d--, No. 98-1532, 2000 WL 762766 (D.C. Cir. June 30, 2000).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	In December 1997, Central Vermont notified FERC that
it would seek a tariff amendment to establish an exit fee (to
recover its own stranded costs).  The recovery of stranded costs
at the wholesale level is the subject of extensive FERC
regulation, recently sustained in almost all respects by the
D.C. Circuit in <U>Transmission Access Policy Study Group</U> v. <U>FERC</U>,
--F.3d--, Nos. 97-1715 et al., 2000 WL 762706, at *24 (D.C. Cir.
June 30, 2000).  FERC accepted the proposed exit fee provision
for filing in March 1998.  <U>See</U> <U>Central Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp.</U>, 82
F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,237, at 61,908 (1998).  A hearing has now been
held before an administrative law judge at FERC, but no decision
on either the propriety or the amount of the fee has yet been
issued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	In late December 1997, as the state's restructuring
proceedings continued, Connecticut Valley applied for a routine
increase in its 1998 retail rates to incorporate increases in
Central Vermont's RS-2 rate schedule.  Such adjustments to the
RS-2 schedule are made periodically by Central Vermont to
reflect changes in its cost of acquiring power, and, in the
past, the Commission has allowed them to be passed through by
Connecticut Valley to its own customers.  FERC accepted Central
Vermont's increased RS-2 rates for filing on January 13, 1998. 
This time, instead of approving the requested increase, the
state commission found Connecticut Valley imprudent for not
terminating the RS-2 contract sooner because power was available
for less money on the open market, and it disallowed the
requested increase.  <U>Connecticut Valley Elec. Co.</U>, Order No.
22,815 (Dec. 31, 1997) ("the Disallowance Order").  This finding
paralleled the reasoning behind its Stranded Cost Recovery
Order. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	In the same period, litigation concerning New
Hampshire's plan for restructuring the electric utility industry
was proceeding in this court and the district court.  In
December 1998, we upheld a preliminary injunction in which the
district court prohibited the Commission from implementing its
broad deregulation plan.  <U>Patch IV</U>, 167 F.3d at 28-29.  However,
in a companion decision, <U>Patch V</U>, we vacated the injunction to
the extent it required the Commission to allow Connecticut
Valley to recover through its retail rates the full cost of
wholesale power purchased under the RS-2 contract.  167 F.3d at
36.  We found that Connecticut Valley had not shown a likelihood
that the Disallowance Order was enjoinable by a federal court
under the restrictive terms of the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1342
(1994).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Our decision in <U>Patch V</U> permitted the Commission to
roll back Connecticut Valley's retail rates to the 1997 level. 
However, after that decision, the Commission ordered Connecticut
Valley to reduce its rates temporarily <U>below</U> the 1997 level in
order to refund to customers the higher rates they had paid
while the district court's preliminary injunction was in effect. 
<U>Connecticut Valley Elec. Co.</U>, Order No. 23,168 (Mar. 22, 1999)
("the Refund Order").  Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont
objected to the district court regarding this further reduction;
the district court agreed; and on April 7, 1999, it enjoined the
Commission from ordering the refund.  The Commission again
appealed to this court.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	In <U>Patch VI</U>, decided on January 24, 2000, we found that
the injunction against the Refund Order could not be sustained
on the basis thus far supplied, but allowed the district court
90 days to provide a sufficient basis for such an injunction. 
202 F.3d at 34-35.  The district court then sought to supply
that explanation and, at the same time, to dispose of the
parties' cross-motions for summary judgment as to the underlying
dispute.  On March 6, 2000, the district court concluded that
Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont are entitled to a
permanent injunction allowing Connecticut Valley to pass through
to its retail customers the cost of wholesale power it purchases
from Central Vermont under the RS-2 contract.  <U>Patch VII</U>, 87 F.
Supp. 2d at 65.  The Commission now appeals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	The district court's summary judgment decision, which
we review <U>de novo</U>, <U>Wightman</U> v. <U>Springfield Terminal Ry. Co.</U>, 100
F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996), rested in major part on an order
of the Commission issued on July 22, 1998, in which the
Commission vacated a directive in its February 1997 Stranded
Cost Recovery Order, <U>Re Statewide Elec. Util. Restructuring
Plan</U>, Order No. 22,986 (July 22, 1998) ("the Vacation Order"). 
In particular, the Vacation Order canceled the Commission's
prior directive instructing Connecticut Valley to terminate the
RS-2 contract.  Because the Commission no longer demanded that
Connecticut Valley terminate its RS-2 Contract on the basis of
its "imprudence," the district court ruled that federal law
required the Commission to allow recovery of the federal tariff
rate for purchases under that contract.  <U>Patch VII</U>, 87 F. Supp.
2d at 64-65.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	We begin our review with the main legal constraint that
governs federal injunctions against state utility rates.  Where
such relief is sought, it is not enough for the utility to
establish federal jurisdiction and a claim for relief on the
merits; it must also show that the injunction comports with the
Johnson Act, which allows such injunctions only under very
limited conditions.  One such condition is where the state rate
order conflicts with a federal statute or a federal agency
action.  <U>See</U> <U>Patch V</U>, 167 F.3d at 33 (citing case law).  The
showing of such a conflict would normally satisfy the Johnson
Act <U>and</U> make out a federal claim for relief.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>,
<U>Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co.</U> v. <U>Mississippi</U>, 487 U.S. 354, 377
(1988).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	The issue in this case is not about these principles,
which are well-settled, but about whether on the facts before us
the challenged orders of the state commission are inconsistent
with a federal regulatory scheme.  Patently, the state
commission is refusing to allow Connecticut Valley to collect
revenues to pay the full federal tariff rate for the power it is
buying from Central Vermont under the RS-2 tariff; indeed, the
refund ordered by the Commission is designed to make Connecticut
Valley give back to customers some of the revenue it collected
for that purpose.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Of course, FERC has not ordered the state commission
to do anything; it has merely allowed Central Vermont to file a
federal tariff (the RS-2 tariff) setting a rate for wholesale
power sales to Connecticut Valley.  But if the purchase is not
improper, then the refusal of the state commission to allow the
purchasing utility to pay the federal tariff rate, and include
that cost in its own rates, is inconsistent with the federal
scheme.  The reason is that the rates set by the FERC tariff are
binding unless and until altered by FERC.  <U>See</U> <U>Mississippi Power
&amp; Light Co.</U>, 487 U.S. at 371-74; <U>Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co.</U> v.
<U>Thornburg</U>, 476 U.S. 953, 970 (1986). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Nevertheless, while the Supreme Court left the issue
open, we held in <U>Patch V</U> that a state commission could disallow
costs, even where they reflected payments required under a
federal tariff, where the state agency had a colorable
independent state ground for finding that the purchaser should
not have made the purchase.  167 F.3d at 35; <U>see also</U> <U>Kentucky
W. Va. Gas Co.</U> v. <U>Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n</U>, 837 F.2d 600,
608-09 (3d Cir.), <U>cert. denied</U>, 488 U.S. 941 (1988).  And,
initially,  the Commission did make a colorable ruling in its
Disallowance Order that Connecticut Valley's continued
purchasing from Central Vermont was imprudent, given Connecticut
Valley's apparent opportunity to terminate its contract on one
year's notice and switch to cheaper--albeit possibly short-term--power from other suppliers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	But faced with the threat of termination, Central
Vermont then filed a tariff amendment that now threatens to
impose a heavy termination charge on Connecticut Valley if it
does cancel its contract.  FERC (which more or less invited the
amendment) has allowed the amendment to go into effect
provisionally and, while FERC may in due course disallow the
charge or reduce its amount, the amendment is in force for the
time being.  <U>See</U> 82 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,237, at 61,909 (1998)
("Central Vermont's proposed exit fee is hereby accepted for
filing and suspended for a nominal period, to become effective
on March 14, 1998, subject to refund . . . ."). Further, the
state commission has now, in its Vacation Order, explicitly
withdrawn the prior ruling that Connecticut Valley should
terminate its requirements contract.  In sum, the Commission's
prior justification for disallowing the pass-through has
evaporated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	The Commission says on appeal that its Vacation Order
only nullified its prior order requiring Connecticut Valley to
terminate the contract and did not affirmatively order the
utility to continue buying under the contract.  The lack of an
affirmative order is irrelevant:  the RS-2 contract requiring
purchases is binding on Connecticut Valley unless terminated;
termination now apparently would be self-defeating because it
would give rise to the prospect of a potentially heavy financial
penalty that the state commission does not want;<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> and so long as
purchases from Central Vermont continue to be legitimately made
under the contract, Connecticut Valley must pay the FERC tariff
rate, and the state commission must allow it to reflect that
rate in its own charges.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Alternatively, the Commission says that even if current
conditions make it prudent to continue the purchases, the
contract could and should have been terminated <U>before</U> Central
Vermont filed the termination charge.  However, read literally,
FERC regulations say that Central Vermont could have imposed the
termination charge, assuming it were otherwise justified,
whenever Connecticut Valley sought to terminate its contract--so
long as the contract was still in force when the charge was
filed.  18 C.F.R. § 35.26(c)(1)(v) (1999).  The RS-2 contract
required at least one-year's notice before termination became
effective.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	The Commission points to language in the original FERC
order adopting such regulations, arguably contrary to the
present regulation itself, saying that a selling utility could
not add an exit fee after a purchasing utility "gives notice" of
termination.  Order No. 888, Promoting Wholesale Competition
Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by
Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities
and Transmitting Utilities, 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540, 21,642 n.679
(1996).  However this arguable tension between the regulation
and order may be resolved, it is hard to see how Connecticut
Valley--a wholly-owned subsidiary--could have effected a
surprise termination.<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>   Also, the FERC order says that even
where notice is given, the seller could still recover its
stranded costs through transmission charges to the canceling
utility.  <U>Id.</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Finally, the Commission, joined in a separate amica
curiae brief by the Governor of New Hampshire, claims that
whether the continued purchases are imprudent under state law is
a matter for the Commission and the state courts, and that the
district court's injunction is inconsistent with the so-called
<U>Burford</U> doctrine.  <U>See</U> <U>Burford</U> v. <U>Sun Oil Co.</U>, 319 U.S. 315,
332-34 (1943).  <U>Burford</U>, discussed at some length in <U>Patch IV</U>,
167 F.3d at 24, aims to prevent federal courts from "bypassing
a state administrative scheme and resolving issues of state law
and policy that are committed in the first instance to expert
administrative resolution."  <U>Id.</U> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	However, we are not concerned here with whether the
imprudence finding is proper under state law but rather with
whether, given its substance and context, it furnishes a basis
for the state commission to ignore an otherwise controlling FERC
tariff.  In such cases, the "adequacy" of an asserted
"independent  state ground" is--indeed, under the Supremacy
Clause must be--an issue of federal law.<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>  <U>Burford</U> does not
license a state to ignore FERC tariffs merely by saying, without
any present rational basis, that the purchase is "imprudent." 
This is so even if the Commission's "imprudence" finding has not
been withdrawn and is still tolerated under state law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">	Nor is it of any moment whether the Commission has, or
has not, acted in good faith in refusing to allow Connecticut
Valley to collect the FERC tariff charges.  Indeed, we assume
throughout that the Commission is motivated simply by a desire
to secure lower rates for New Hampshire consumers.  But absent
a colorable objective justification, the state agency may not
disallow, in state rate-making proceedings, costs that were 
incurred under a federal tariff for a permissible purchase of
wholesale power.</FONT></P>
