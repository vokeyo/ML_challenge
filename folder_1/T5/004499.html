&quot;For you remember our labor and toil, sisters and brothers.  We worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you.&quot;<br>
Let us pray.
<p>
Father, as we return to our duties today, we do not ask to be extricated heroically from difficult situations, but we do pray for a spirit of understanding of the labors and pressures of each other as all of us seek to do our own jobs.
<p>
Where we are in error, reform us!

Where we seem empty handed, furnish us!

Where we are right, strengthen and confirm us!
<p>
And to You will be the glory.<br>
Amen.

<p>
/ <i><u>73.2. &nbsp; (Statewide Funding Requirements)  The sources of general fund revenues appropriated in this provision are as follows:  E16-State Treasurer's Office:  $1,400,000 must be transferred to the general fund from Unclaimed Property Subfund 3879; E16-State Treasurer's Office:  $3,284,872 Excess Debt Service from FY 2002-03 must be carried forward and credited to the general fund in FY 2003-04; and E12-Comptroller General's Office: $2,400,000 must be transferred to the general fund from Unemployment Compensation Insurance Subfund 4007.  The State Treasurer shall take custody of unclaimed property, reported before November 1, 2003 for the year ending June 30, 2003, as payable or distributable in the course of a demutualization of an insurance company, and deposit into the general fund all monies received as abandoned property.  Unclaimed property payable or distributable in the course of a demutualization of an insurance company is presumed abandoned five years after the earlier of the date:  (1) of last contact with the policyholder; or (2) the property became payable or distributable.  The above listed funds are transferred to the General Fund of the State, and by this provision, these transfers are deemed to have occurred and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, these general fund revenues are available for appropriation as provided in this paragraph.  Any restrictions concerning specific utilization of these funds are lifted for the specified fiscal year.  From the amount recouped from state agencies and transferred to the general fund pursuant to this proviso and from the first $5,000,000 realized from demutualization of funds, there is appropriated for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2003 and ending June 30, 2004, the following sums for the stated purposes:  H12-Clemson University: Center for Research of Wireless Communication $500,000; H27-University of South Carolina: Materials Research Science &amp; Engineering Center (Nano-Technology) $1,000,000; L04-Department of Social Services:  Child Support Enforcement Automated System $232,134; E12-Comptroller General: GASB #34 Compliance $602,546; J04-Department of Health &amp; Environmental Control: Operating Expenses $1,016,597; J12-Department of Mental Health: Forensic Capacity $2,125,000; J12-Department of Mental Health: Sexual Predator Program $750,000; X12-Aid to Subdivisions-Comptroller General: $410,698 distributed as follows:  Aid Cnty-Clerks of Court $6,567; Aid Cnty-Probate Judges $6,567; Aid Cnty-Sheriffs $6,567; Aid Cnty-Register of Deeds, $2,425; Aid Cnty-Auditors $194,286; and Aid Cnty-Treasurers $194,286; E28-Election Commission: Primary Elections $2,400,000; F03-Budget and Control Board: Base Closure Fund $287,500; Y14-State Ports Authority: Dredging $500,000; and. L04-Department of Social Services: Heritage Pregnancy Prevention $460,000.  Any amount realized from demutualization above the first five million dollars shall be appropriated in the following manner for the purposes stated:  A17-Legislative Printing &amp; Information Technology Systems: Licenses $500,000; L12-John De La Howe School: Operating Expenses $150,000; J16-Department of Disabilities and Special Needs: Special Olympics $50,000; E28-Election Commission: HAVA Federal Match $700,000; P20-Clemson University-Public Service Activities: Operating Expenses $1,000,000; H71-Wil Lou Gray Opportunity School: Operating Expenses $117,657; Department of Public Safety $1,000,000; and Department of Natural Resources $1,000,000.  The appropriations in this provision are contingent and therefore all items are to be funded on a pro-rata basis should revenue fall below the anticipated amount.  Unexpended funds appropriated pursuant to this part may be carried forward to succeeding fiscal years and expended for the same purposes.  No appropriation in this provision may be paid before the later of September 1, 2003, or the date the Comptroller General closes the state's books on Fiscal Year 2002-03.  Appropriations in this provision resulting from demutualization shall be paid as soon as practicable after November 1, 2003.  Contingent upon the approval of the Tobacco Settlement Revenue Management Authority and parties to the trust agreement, the State Treasurer's Office shall transfer an amount equal to $6,767,866 from the unrestricted taxable proceeds portion of the principal of the Healthcare Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund established pursuant to Section 11-11-170(B)(1) of the 1976 Code to the Department of Health and Human Services to be expended for Medicaid.</u> &nbsp;  &nbsp; /</i>

<center><b>Remarks by Senator LAND</b></center>
<p>
Mr. PRESIDENT and ladies and gentlemen of the Senate.
<p>
We have worked hard on this budget, but I have to say to you that we really haven't accomplished much.  We took the money that we had and spread it around, and I think we spread it around inadequately.  We have not lived up to our commitment to the children of this State.  We have not lived up to our commitment to the educational community.  We have not lived up to our commitment to higher education.  We are causing students and families all across the State of South Carolina to pay higher fees and tuition - all across the state, simply because we thought our hands were tied up here and we would not come up with additional revenue.  I really think we are letting our constituents down.
<p>
I can't vote for this budget, Senator from Florence, and I appreciate all of your hard work and I appreciate the staff's hard work.  I just don't think we have stepped up to the plate, and I don't think we met our obligations to the people of this State.  We can do better than what we have done.  We can do a lot better than what we have done.  We are back to 1995 standards on education per pupil funding under the EFA, and I remind you again that that is a law that we passed many years ago that set the formula to tell us how much we had to do, Senator from Pickens, and we ignored it.  We didn't meet the full formula of funding for higher education, another formula that we passed for ourselves as to how we would fund our students in college, and we haven't done it.  We have just let the people down across this State because either we were timid in not raising taxes or we had signed some pledge not to raise taxes or we somehow expected those on the local level to step us and bail us out.  I am happy to say in a way and shameful to tell you in another way, Senator from Charleston, that many communities have stepped up to do that which we are not willing to do.  All of the counties and the school districts in my district have stepped up and increased tuition, because they recognize that they can't pause in this work on education in South Carolina.  We can't stop.  We can't take a breather.  We can't find a rock to hide under to say we just don't have the money to do what we know we have to do, and we know what it is going to cost us in the long run if we don't do it.
<p>
You can't stop this big ship called &quot;Public Education in South Carolina&quot; and let it pause and then all of a sudden crank it back up and make up for lost ground.  You will never make it up.  You will never make it up.  As I told you before, our children aren't just competing in the counties in which they live.  They aren't competing just in the state.  They are competing internationally - globally - for jobs.  We had a good educational movement going on in South Carolina, and we are going to let a little bump in the road just stop us in our tracks - stop us in our tracks.  We aren't doing right by those who are in our mental health institutions and those who are getting mental health services all across the State of South Carolina.  We are letting them down.  Unless something gets in the budget to adequately fund Medicaid, we are just leaving all these funds in Washington that ought to be coming back here.  We haven't done right.  I have never seen this Senate when it didn't step up to the plate.  I have never seen this Senate when we couldn't outdo the House of Representatives in funding the necessary needs of this State.  And for the second time since I have been here, we haven't done that.  Two years ago I voted against the budget for the first time in about 27 years at that particular time, because it didn't do what it should have done for the people of South Carolina.  Again, I will vote against this budget, because Senator from Cherokee, we are not doing what we were elected to do.  We are simply not doing right by the children of this State.  They deserve better.  They are the ones who don't vote, because they aren't old enough to vote.  They have to depend on us to do what is right for them, but we haven't done it.
<p>
We really ought to think hard and long about what we are going on this next Bill that comes up before us.  We will have another chance to do something for education - to come up with the revenue to do it.  I hope that lightening will strike or some cloud will come over this State House and convince us as to what we need to do.  Senator from Greenwood, I have seen you many times come up at the last minute to fund South Carolina, and each year I left here when the Session was over proud of what we had done for this State and mostly for our children.  Because obviously, our first priority is to our children and that is why over half our budget goes to the funding of education.  This budget just doesn't do it.  It doesn't do it for the mentally retarded.  It doesn't do it, Senator from Williamsburg, for the Department of Natural Resources, and that is important in our quality of life and our quantity of life that we enjoy on the outside.  We haven't done right by our prisoners.  We have not done right for the educational system within the prison system.  I understand that the Palmetto School District, as they call it, is just about now defunct.  So we are going to take those people in prison who average a sixth grade education, and we are going to say, &quot;Yes, sir, when you leave here you will not have helped the average a bit, because we aren't going to give you any education whatsoever.  We are going to put you back out on the street, unemployed or underemployed, and basically ignorant, and you will probably find your way right back to this prison, and we will spend another $40,000 to $50,000 a year,&quot; which I understand is the cost if you figure in the capital improvements that go along with our prison system.
<p>
We have not done right by them, and, yes, you might not like them, but once you take custody of them and put them in jail you have got them until you turn them loose again and you are going to have to be humane to them.  You ought to have to be humane to those prison guards.  You are setting them up in a dangerous situation - understaffed, underpaid.  Something bad is going to happen to our prisons before too long because of what we have done.
<p>
I have said all of this to you before and I feel like a broken record, but I just want to look in your faces and tell you again what we are doing.  And I am perplexed.  I don't know why always in the past we could step up, Senator from Rock Hill, and do what we had to do.  We could find the revenue to do it.  Why this year?  Why this year do we just lay down and pass a budget that may well be equal to or less than the House of Representatives.  And I have said before that the Speaker of the House of Representatives goes to bed every night with a prayer, &quot;Lord, please don't let the Senate pass the House budget.&quot;  &quot;Please get them to improve on it,&quot; - because they depend on us.
<p>
One other item, Senator from Florence, you just had on your list was the primary.  Did you think that the House of Representatives when they sent their Bill over here thought that the primary was not going to occur next June and they would be free?  No, they knew we would do it.  Big Daddy over here would step up, Senator from Charleston, and fund that which they knew and we know we have to fund.  We have a state run primary and we have to fund it.  But they didn't do it.  We did.  But we left so many things unfunded, and I am just not proud.
<p>
But, we have another chance - one more chance, and I hope the Senator from Aiken will put up his amendment again.  I am even praying that the other Senator from Aiken might join in.  They would be proposing an amendment for the people of South Carolina that will fund our government and fund our children and fund our students in college.  That probably won't happen, but I will try it again.
<p>
Senator, I will answer one question, and I am through because I have talked longer than I intended to.
<p>
Senator SETZLER:  Did you know that when this Bill leaves, we will be funding EFA at $1,643 per student which is $130 less per student than last year after the budget cuts and takes us back to 1995 levels?  That is what we are telling the people in our State.
<p>
Senator LAND:  Senator, I don't want to believe that.  I don't want to believe that there is a soul in this Senate that would vote for that.  That is terrible.  That is the perfect example as to why I am not voting for this budget and why I don't think that this budget serves the State of South Carolina and the people of South Carolina.  And, we have let everyone down by not having the initiative and the wherewithal to come up with the necessary funds to fund our state government and to fund our State that we are all so proud of, Senator from Lexington.  It is a wonderful state, but I will tell you what - this budget is wrong and I can't vote for it.
<p>
God bless you.
<p>
On motion of Senator PATTERSON, with unanimous consent, Senator LAND's remarks were ordered in the Journal.

<p>
<center><b>Remarks by Senator KNOTTS</b></center>
<p>
Thank you, Mr. PRESIDENT.
<p>
I have sat here now for almost 31/2 weeks and we have looked everywhere we could possibly look for money to run this State.  I came to the House in 1995, until I was elected last year to the Senate.  You know, in those good years there was plenty of money, a lot pork barrel politics, a lot of waste, and nobody worried about spending the money.  When I ran for election the first time, I ran on my base in Lexington County, my conservative base.  That base was &quot;protect me, protect me from government.&quot;  That is what got me elected, elected each and every time, as high as 78-80 percent of the vote one time.  Well, number one, I did not promise them that I would do a thing when I came to the State House except protect their pocket books from government.  You know, our citizens and taxpayers out there, everyday that they live, are going through problems in life to be able to keep the money that they work hard for and to be able to spend it on their families.  Every time they leave home, or do not have to leave their homes, they take the chance of being robbed, mugged or fired to cut off their money supply.  They go out and purchase a nice home for their families in which to live so they can send their children to school and be able to go and enjoy what life has to offer and the freedom that this country and this State supposedly guarantees them.  Then, after they buy what they have to buy to put in their homes, whether they stay at home or go out, they have to worry about somebody coming and stealing it.  A lot of them cannot afford insurance to replace it, and if they can, the cost is high due to the actions of other people to the point where they cannot stand the high cost and continue the payments so they lose their insurance.  At the end of the year, without their knowledge, government raises their taxes or either reassesses their homes without any real input from them.  It gets to the point that, when they go up there to complain, it does not matter because the government has to have it to run the government.  You know, we have got people in Lexington County that bought their homes 20, 30 and 40 years ago.  When they bought it, they were in the country.  Through reassessment -- with no problem of theirs -- everything they have ever done is to live in that home, raise their family and every year in November they are subjected to having their home taken away from them because taxes -- whether they are millage increases or reassessments -- go up and they cannot afford to pay the taxes.
<p>
There is no provision in this State that I know of that would allow a person who cannot afford to pay their taxes and have equity in their homes to be able to have a lien placed against their home so that it would be paid at the time that its ownership is transferred.  There is no protection for them in that aspect.  We do not look at those ways to help the taxpayer.
<p>
During this whole 31/2 weeks, I've not seen one person here who thinks about the taxpayer in any manner except how much money do we need to run this State and where we are going to get it?  They did not think about the salaries at the University of South Carolina for professors that do not teach a full course load but receive full pay.  That is waste.  In any job that a taxpayer works, if they do not go to work, or they are sick and they do not have sick leave, they do not get paid.  That is not fair for you to sit here and condone or allow anybody in state government to get paid without working.  But yet, you expect the taxpayer to do it.
<p>
In November, their home is sold because they cannot put a lien on their home to save the home in which they raised their children.  They are the senior citizens or whatever that, when their taxes went up and up, they could not afford it.  A man goes to his grave thinking that he has paid for a home so that his family will be able to live in it until his spouse dies or passes.  Now, in these times, these people go to their graves and their loved ones are not protected because at any time Mr. Taxman can come in and take the property and sell it.
<p>
But, yet, we want a million here and a million there.  We want a fee here and a fee there.  Now, there's a new kid on the block -- a surcharge -- not to mention the user fee, disposal fee, gas tax, federal tax, state tax, county tax, school tax, etc.  They stopped calling them taxes because people know what a tax is.  You try to dress a tax and name it something else.  But, I assure you, people out there now aren't fooled.  They realize that, if it is not money that they can spend after they have worked all week to spend on their family and to be able to spend it the way they want to without the government directing them in another manner, it is a tax.  I do not care how or what you name it, it is a tax.  You cannot even die now in South Carolina and be tax-free.  You cannot even go to your grave without having to pay taxes.  Your State has to pay taxes.  It is a shame the way we treat people in South Carolina.  It is an absolute shame and we should be admonished for doing it.
<p>
I was once told by a taxpayer that the only time that my pocket book, bank account and I am safe is when the legislature is out of session, or when the County Council or School Boards are not meeting -- or some government body is not meeting that can take my money.  I read that the average taxpayer has to work now almost over half a year to pay the taxes.  People, enough is enough.  They are tired of it.  My base is tired of it.  They want to own the home that they live in.  But, guess what our paths are?  Our paths now have changed.  We only want to pick on the weak.  We want to tax that person who is not able to hire a lobbyist to go to the State House and lobby for them.
<p>
I have been here ten years and have not seen a lobbyist hanging out in the lobby that was for the taxpayer.  They have only one time to lobby and that is whenever it comes time to vote.  And, some of us in this body remember the taxpayer.  We remember what they go through because some of us are struggling taxpayers.  The people of South Carolina do not mind paying taxes for things that are needed and that are not wasteful, if it is something that they can get something out of.  But, when we go into a system like we have developed in this State, which I have seen in the past ten years  -- my thoughts were that it was just in the House, but it is not.  It is in the Senate, county and city councils.  It is everywhere.
<p>
We pass laws up here -- we pass criminal laws -- and now we are attaching surcharges to those crimes.  For example, a speeding ticket that was $50.00 is now $400.00 because of surcharges.  The fellows that have insurance wait.  We want to get in every aspect of people's lives -- not only to tell them how to spend their money, but what they can and cannot do.  I think that sometimes we have the mentality that the taxpayer is not smart enough to do things on their own because they are not smart enough to run some of us out of office for raising their taxes.  It is a shame.  That is not the mentality to have of the taxpayer, because they are smart.
<p>
My base knows who is here to protect their pocket book and they know how to vote.  They know when someone is promising something that they cannot deliver.  People run for office saying that -- if I get elected or re-elected, I am going to do this and I am going to do that or I am promising you that this year we are going to get his done.  I do not do that.  I tell my people, &quot;JAKE KNOTTS in the State House is like you being there, because I am going to protect you every minute that I am there and protect your pocketbook.&quot;
<p>
I have found an amendment that really doesn't amount to anything -- a little $3,000 raise but it showed that I read the budget.  I tried to read that entire budget but it was so complicated that half of the people in here did not know what was going on in it.   You had to crosscheck here and check there and then check with the state agencies to see if that was a true figure or not.  Now, this is a process that has already been introduced by the House, sent to the Senate, sent to the committee, and worked on in the committee and brought back to the Senate for us to reduce.  If there is anybody in here who liked the way that budget was done this year, I want to meet you.  It was not the proper way to produce a budget or run a business.  It is not the proper way to have to sit there through that much agony to find a $3,000 pay raise for the ONLY state employee in the entire State that deserves a pay raise.  Then we find in the budget, that we -- members of the Senate -- are not even protected.  Because when we go home, we put it in the hands of the Budget and Control Board.  And what do they do?  They have the neatest system in the world.  They borrow money or allow a loan to be borrowed in one breath from an agency that helps the people.  Guess where they took the money from -- local government funds.  What does that do?  That provides water and sewer and services to our local taxpayers.  It provides them ways to be able to have water and sewer.
<p>
We also talk about matched money.  We do not want to lose funding from Washington because the State will match it.  Now, local government funds are a five to one match.  Then, what do they do?  They give the money to an area, which, in turn, gives the money to a private overseer to spend.  Now, our Budget and Control Board on the other hand wants to forgive the debt.  We will go back and we will write in the budget a forgiveness proviso.  Where the contract that you signed to get that money -- not only from the local government, but the insurance reserve funds that you hurt -- to P.R.T.  Don't you think that our taxpayers would love to have that type of agreement from their banker?  But, you see, we are average people.  We have to pay back loans.  We have to work and dodge the government's taxes enough to be able to save enough money and work multiple jobs like many people to be able to pay the payments back to the bank.  We cannot just forgive a $3.5 million dollar loan.  Our taxpayers do not have that availability.  We do that because we are dealing with the taxpayer's pocket book.  It is easy for us to come up here and take.  And, every time we have a problem, I know where we can get the money.  We will look -- try to look -- and overlook what we want to overlook because we can look into the taxpayers pocketbook because the taxpayer has deep pockets.  That is not our job.   I believe that we forget what our jobs are from time to time up here.  We forget about what that taxpayer has to go through to make the money so we can sit up here all day today.  And it was worth it.  I didn't go home and I haven't missed a day in ten years.  I know that a lot of you all here probably would have liked for me to miss a day.  But, my grandson came up here today to be with me because he wanted to be with his Pa-Pa.  He sat with me all afternoon while we were in here trying to do what we are doing right now -- in here from 2:30 A.M. last night and in here for 31/2 weeks.  Do you think the taxpayers appreciate that?  Do you know what my grandson is going to tell his class tomorrow on his last day of school?  He visited his Pa-Pa at the State House to be with him to see what he did.  He asked me, &quot;I have been here for four hours, is this what you all do every day?  Because, you all did not do anything.&quot;  This was an eight-year old recognizing that fact.  That is a shame.  Is that the message we want to send to our people?  Do you think that, if an eight-year old sees it, that the taxpayer sees it?
<p>
The taxpayer cares about you doing your job in here, not how much money you can spend, but how much money you can spend to adequately give for services needed to run the State -- not a penny more, not a penny less.  They do not mind paying their fair share.  But, they are tired of every time that we need a dollar we reach into their pocketbook and try to get the money from them.  I want you to know one thing -- this is from the heart -- if someone comes to talk to you with a prepared statement, that is not something a lot of time he wants to say.  It's something somebody has said for him or statistics he's gotten to prove a point.  But, when I approach the podium on something I believe in as much as tax relief for the citizens of our State, I do not bring paperwork, prepared statements or slide shows.  I have been there, done that.  I have worn the t-shirts and paid the taxes.  I have paid the taxes that have been wasted over the years by government.
<p>
I want to just sit back and do what we have been able to do here in the last 31/2 weeks because we do not want to cost the taxpayers any more money by staying in special session to do a job that we should have been doing for the last 31/2 weeks.  It is not the blame of the Democrats or the Republicans.  The fact is, we do not have any money because we have lived outside of our means for the last nine years.
<p>
You know, there are a couple of old sayings I would like to share with you in closing. First, &quot;Do not forget where you come from and do not forget what got you there.&quot;  Bubba Ness told me that, if you do not remember your friends on your way up, they won't remember you on your way down.  Bubba Ness has been a dear friend to me through the years, but, of the elected officials in this body and the rest of the elected officials of this State, you had better take heed -- if you do not start remembering the taxpayer when you get there, they will not put you there anymore.
<p>
I am now open for questions.
<p>
Senator ANDERSON:  Did you know that investing in education is the best investment we can make in our State?
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  Senator, I agree with you.  We need to invest in education and I am glad you asked that question.   I was not going to get into that.  But, I notice that we have money in the budget for school buses, supposedly.  But, whenever you expect school buses to have -- and putting things in perspective, such as, a battery casing to hold the battery -- it has to be stainless steel.  You expect stainless steal for a non-corrosive battery.  When have you ever thought in your lifetime in modern years?  They do not make them anymore.  But yet, we expect our school buses to have a stainless steel battery casing to replace a black iron battery casing for the excuse of non-corrosive batteries.  Guess what the price of that is?  The stainless steel battery is right at $500.00 per bus which replaces a $14.00 dollar black iron casing.  Only 14 have been replaced in 10 years.  That is a waste.  Do you know why we do things like that?  Because, it is the taxpayers' money, Senator.
<p>
Senator ANDERSON:  Did you know that I will agree with you that you are protecting your people's pocketbook, because if there are no jobs, their pocketbooks have no money in it -- only because we have invested in education, is why your county is doing so well?&quot;
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  Yes, sir, because we have flipped the Bill.   Our people in Lexington County have flipped the Bill -- built the schools.  They have worked hard to pay the taxes and we have a good education system.
<p>
Senator ANDERSON:  Can you tell me what you are going to tell your grandson when he gets a little older if there are no jobs available because industry has gone to other states because you under-funded education within our State?
<p>
Senator KNOTTS: Let me answer you this way. You always say you under-fund education.  I think that we fund education and we fund the basic education.  We try to fund and basically fund a lot of perks in education.  But, there are a lot of things -- in the waste of the school bus battery casing, for example, and in the waste of the Administration building down here.  Whenever we saw the Senator from Charleston's amendment yesterday on administration of the money -- it is things like that we need to look at.  There is not one Senator in this body here tonight that knows how much money is in the pockets of these special groups and their departments and little special funds in the State of South Carolina.
<p>
We have got pockets of money in every agency that have been put in special funds in a bank account that we have no control over.  That is where we fund education.  We need to go back to a zero-based budget and go back to find what we have funded with special little surcharges and disposal fees.  We need to find out how much the State has and come back and fund education with the money with which it is supposed to be funded.  Let's fund it across the State equally.
<p>
Senator ANDERSON:  Do you know that healthcare in South Carolina is at a crisis? It will continue to be a problem until we find ways to fund it properly.  There are poor folks that will have to make a decision of whether to pay for prescription drugs or purchase food in order to survive.  Did you know that?
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  Yes, sir.  You can start correcting that, if you start taking a look at the entire state of the State and it's financial ability to collect these surcharges.  You can start by simply not just sitting here and taking the word of five or six Senators on one side and five and six Senators on the other.  But, say, &quot;Let's find the money.  Let's find out where it is and let's go.&quot;
<p>
Senator from Charleston:  In my district I have 47% government employees, which includes state, county, city and federal employees.  I would not be able to make the speech and comments you just made due to my district being dominated by government employees.  What percentage of your district is made up of government employees?
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  I am glad you asked that.  I probably have one of the largest percentages of government employees in the State.  Most of the government employees live in Richland or Lexington County.
<p>
I have pride in my employees and that is why I do not want anybody in this State that is a state employee to get a raise unless every state employee gets a raise  -- or, an agency head review board going back behind the legislature and giving the agency heads a 10-15% raise.  The state employee is the one that is doing the regular work for $15,000 to $16,000 a year that makes the agency heads look good where the agency heads are making over $100,000 a year.  Do you realize that we have agency heads that are making more than our Governor?  That is not right or fair and should not be tolerated by this body.  If one state employee gets a raise, then all state employees should get a raise for their hard work.
<p>
That is where I am coming from.  I am on the side of the little man -- the man that is not looked at or thought of.  Why?  He is the man with the money. We can get it with out putting a gun to his head.  That is what is wrong with the whole problem of government.  This government needs to return to working for the people, not the people working for the government.
<p>
Senator HOLLAND:  You have got me thoroughly confused.  Senator, you talked about the democrats -- it is as if you were a democrat all of your life; but, when it comes time to vote, you vote for the republican.  You don't want to spend any money.
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  You know, Senator, I did not come up here to spend their money.  I came up here to save their money.
<p>
Senator HOLLAND:  Do you believe that, if you take all the people employed by the University and fire them, we could improve the budget?
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  No, sir, but I guarantee you one thing -- I could have taken the salaries that were $211,000 on a sabbatical leave that had not worked all year -- there was a way to get around it.  They would have worked that year or I would have cut the salary.   But, you all voted that amendment down.
<p>
Senator HOLLAND:  Now, how would that have helped us?  To close every university, would that help us get out of where we are?
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  No, sir.  I am not trying to close up the universities.  I am trying to let us take responsibility as elected officials to the people that have the money -- the taxpayers, not the lobbyists and not the agencies -- and let's go to a zero-based budget and get the job done.  It is not right for us to sit here and hide behind the fact that we have people that are going to close the university.  I am not advocating the closing of this fine institution anyway.  It is a great institution that provides a great way of helping our community in providing our people with a good education in order for them to get good jobs upon graduation.  That is just the way that it is and I would hope that you all would begin taking heed to that and remember the people.  As I have stated before, I have yet to see a paid lobbyist for the taxpayer.  We are supposed to be the taxpayers' lobbyist.  That is what our job is.  They elect us to protect them.
<p>
Senator MALLOY:  Do you support the Appropriation Bill?
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  I support parts of it, and some parts I don't.  I have tried to correct it; but, it is basically the only thing that we have after we have been here this long.  We are facing a crisis of whether we pass the budget or not or stay for an extended time at the cost of the taxpayer.
<p>
Senator MALLOY:  Are you going to vote for it?
<p>
Senator KNOTTS:  I do not know.  If I do, it will be because I believe that we have done the best job we can do in this body to save the taxpayers' money.
<p>
Thank you, Mr. PRESIDENT.

<p>
<center><b>Statement by Senator MOORE</b></center>
<p>
I voted against H. 3749, the General Appropriation Bill, because it does not provide for the basic needs of many of the citizens of the State.  Funding for Public Education is at the 1995 level, health care for uninsured children, nursing homes, senior citizens and the handicapped has been under-funded by $232 million and those needing mental health services will have to be served in emergency rooms.  In addition, we face the possibility of the federal courts requiring the release of criminals and delinquents back into the community before having served their sentence, placing an even greater burden on our public safety officers who are too few in number and are improperly equipped.
<p>
During the deliberations, I offered an amendment that would have raised the sales tax by two percent, which would not apply to food, and  would have raised the cigarette tax.  These two items would have raised enough revenue to properly fund the basic education of our children, fund the Medicaid match and fund agencies providing necessary services and protection to the citizens of this State.  This revenue would have also exempted those having taxable income of $15,000 or less from paying income tax, increased the homestead exemption for senior citizens and lowered the tax rate for many small businesses.  This proposal along with many others would have improved the condition of this State but were not adopted.  Without the funding necessary to meet the basic needs of our citizens, I could not vote for the Bill.
