Maria: Following is a note about Functional Context Education (FCE). As you
<BR>can see, it is a conceptual approach to education derived from cognitive
<BR>science and empirical research on teaching adults. Equipped for the Future
<BR>(EFF) had its origins in an approach to education based on developing
<BR>content standards (what adults should know and be able to do) for adult
<BR>basic education. I have not seen empirical research showing the
<BR>effectiveness of instruction based on EFF nor am I aware of the extent to
<BR>which EFF is used across the US. Perhaps some members of this discussion
<BR>list can provide information about the use of and effectiveness of EFF.

<BR>
<BR>Introduction to Functional Context Education (FCE)
<BR>Research-Based Principles and Case Studies
<BR>
<BR>Tom Sticht
<BR>International Consultant in Adult Education
<BR>
<BR>Research on &quot;contextualizing,&quot; &quot;embedding,&quot; or &quot;integrating&quot; basic skills
<BR>into content subject matter of relevance to adult learner's interests and
<BR>goals was introduced as Functional Context Education (FCE) in workshops I
<BR>presented in 1987 and in lectures I presented in the United Kingdom in 1992
<BR>sponsored by the Basic Skills Agency (then known as the Adult Literacy and
<BR>Basic Skills Unit-ALBSU).
<BR>
<BR>In 1997 and again in 1999 I gave a series of FCE workshops in several
<BR>provinces of Canada. This month, the National Adult Literacy Database
<BR>(NALD) reported that the 1997 report on &quot;Functional Context Education
<BR>(FCE): Making Learning Relevant&quot;, which I prepared to accompany the earlier
<BR>FCE workshops, was among the most frequently downloaded reports on the NALD
<BR>web site [<A HREF="http://www.nald.ca/fulltext/context/cover.htm]">http://www.nald.ca/fulltext/context/cover.htm]</A>
<BR>during August 2005. From January 2005 through August, the FCE notebook has
<BR>been downloaded 8,394 times.
<BR>
<BR>Support for FCE principles can be found in the United Kingdom in reports of
<BR>the Department for Education and Skills (DfES)
<BR>(www.dfes.gov.uk/readwriteplus/embeddedlearning), National Institute for
<BR>Adult Continuing Education (NIACE)
<BR>(www.niace.org.uk/projects/LrningfromExperience/EBS/What-is-EBS.htm), and
<BR>National Research and Development Center (NRDC) for Adult Literacy &amp;
<BR>Numeracy (www.nrdc.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=600).
<BR>
<BR>All three of these organizations published reports on &quot;embedded basic
<BR>skills&quot; which follow principles from FCE as introduced in a 1987 book by
<BR>colleagues and myself called Cast-off Youth. This book presents a number of
<BR>&quot;silver standard&quot; (quasi-experimental) studies in vocational training and
<BR>adult literacy education which formed the research base from which
<BR>principles for FCE were induced.
<BR>
<BR>What is Functional Context Education (FCE)?
<BR>
<BR>Functional Context Education is an approach to education that is based Upon
<BR>a cognitive science theory of cognitive development, learning, and
<BR>instruction. The theoretical framework and the principles for applying this
<BR>framework to the task of instructional development are discussed in the 1997
<BR>notebook.
<BR>
<BR>Literacy is given special attention in FCE because of its importance to all
<BR>schooling and instruction in our information age. A general thesis is that
<BR>the idea that literacy is something one must &quot;get&quot; in one program, which is
<BR>then &quot;applied&quot; in another is misleading. Rather, it is argued that literacy
<BR>is developed while it is being applied. This means that for the large
<BR>numbers of youth and adults who read between the fifth and ninth grade
<BR>levels, literacy and content skills education can be integrated. Therefore
<BR>there is no need for special &quot;remedial&quot; literacy programs to get students
<BR>to &quot;prerequisite&quot; levels of literacy before they are permitted to study the
<BR>&quot;real thing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>In overview, education based on functional context theory includes the
<BR>following
<BR>conceptual framework:
<BR>
<BR>O Society and culture provide the most important resources for human
<BR>cognitive development. These resources include symbols and symbol
<BR>systems, such as the natural language and conceptual (in contrast to
<BR>perceptual)
<BR>knowledge, which constitute the primary means for the transmission of
<BR>cognitive abilities.
<BR>
<BR>O The learner possesses a &quot;human cognitive system&quot; with an internal
<BR>knowledge base &quot;inside the head&quot; and access to an external knowledge base in
<BR>the
<BR>world &quot;outside the head.&quot; The learner has a working, or short term memory in
<BR>which processing skills such as language are used to move information in
<BR>and out of both the internal and external knowledge bases.
<BR>
<BR>O Learning is information processing whereby the learner actively seeks out
<BR>information used in constructing a meaningful interpretation of the world
<BR>and a knowledge base comprised of these interpretations.
<BR>
<BR>O A developmental perspective of literacy emphasizing the development of
<BR>oral language from earlier prelinguistic knowledge and literacy as the
<BR>amalgam of prelinguistic, linguistic and graphic symbolic knowledge.
<BR>
<BR>O The importance of context in learning new information and in
<BR>transferring information already learned to new and different problems
<BR>and situations.
<BR>
<BR>The application of this theoretical framework to the instructional
<BR>development process suggests creating courses that facilitate learning on
<BR>entry into the course, learning throughout the course, and transfer into
<BR>the contexts for which the learning is meant to apply. To accomplish these
<BR>objectives, courses should be developed that:
<BR>
<BR>1.  Explain what the students are to learn and why in such a way that they
<BR>can always understand both the immediate and long term usefulness of the
<BR>course content (facilitates entry into the course; motivates learning).
<BR>
<BR>2.  Consider the old knowledge that students bring with them to the course,
<BR>and build new knowledge on the basis of this old knowledge (facilitates
<BR>entry learning)
<BR>
<BR>3.  Sequence each new lesson so that it builds on prior knowledge gained in
<BR>The previous lessons (facilitates in-course learning).
<BR>
<BR>4. Integrate instruction in reading, writing, arithmetic, and problem
<BR>solving into academic or technical training programs as the content of the
<BR>course poses requirements for information processing using these skills that
<BR>many potential students may not possess (facilitates in-course learning;
<BR>motivates basic skills learning; reduces instruction time; develops
<BR>&quot;learning to learn&quot; ability).
<BR>
<BR>5. Derive objectives from careful analysis of the explicit and tacit
<BR>knowledge and skill needed in the home, community, academic, technical
<BR>training,
<BR>or employment context for which the learner is preparing (facilitates
<BR>transfer).
<BR>
<BR>6. Use, to the extent possible, learning contexts, tasks, materials, and
<BR>procedures taken from the future situation in which the learner will be
<BR>functioning (facilitates transfer, retention and further development of
<BR>skills).
<BR>
<BR>Why is FCE important for youth and adult education?
<BR>
<BR>Unlike children, who tend to do things to please their parents or teachers,
<BR>youth and adults will usually want to understand the functional utility
<BR>of investing time and mental energy in learning something. With respect to
<BR>out-of-school youth and adults then, FCE focuses on improving
<BR>
<BR>(1) Participation in adult education programs by making explicit the
<BR>relationship between what students want to learn, what is being taught
<BR>and its application in the contexts that the person will be functioning in
<BR>after the educational program, this promotes increased motivation;
<BR>
<BR>(2) Achievement in learning and transfer by ensuring that instruction
<BR>relates to the learner's prior knowledge in such a way that the learner
<BR>can function within the learning situation and improving transfer by
<BR>deriving instructional contents as much as possible from the future contexts
<BR>in
<BR>which the person will apply the learning, and
<BR>
<BR>(3) Prevention of learning problems in future generations by designing
<BR>youth and adult programs that maximize the intergenerational transfer of
<BR>the adults' new skills and attitudes about education to their children.
<BR>
<BR>A New Workshop and Notebook
<BR>
<BR>The 1997 FCE notebook elaborates upon the principles summarized above
<BR>and illustrates the application of these principles in case studies of
<BR>programs for adults, including family literacy programs with a focus upon
<BR>women's
<BR>education that can provide an intergenerational transfer of language and
<BR>literacy skills to their children.
<BR>
<BR>A new notebook, &quot;Functional Context Education: Making Learning Relevant for
<BR>the 21st Century&quot;, brings the previous workshop up to date in treating
<BR>topics
<BR>such as globalization, sustainable development, internet web sites, health
<BR>literacy, and English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). In addition
<BR>to an extensive historical review of adult literacy that illustrates the
<BR>use of FCE principles, the new workshop includes three case studies with
<BR>quasi-experimental designs having both treatment and comparison groups
<BR>and quantitative data from pre- post-testing. Such research cases are
<BR>extremely
<BR>rare in adult basic skills education and the fact that there are three of
<BR>such
<BR>evidence-based studies supporting FCE adds to the unique features and
<BR>use validity of Functional Context Education.
