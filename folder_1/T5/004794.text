  Description:
    Abstract: The side scan sonar image of the sea floor (120-350 m water depths) was mosaiced from data collected in 2002.  
       An Edgetech DF1000 side scan system was used for geophysical surveying using only the 100Khz data.  A Trimble DSM212H 
       differential GPS was used for positioning.  Navigation from the GPS and Gyro were logged in Hypack version 005B (Coastal 
       Oceanographics). Isis Sonar (Triton Imaging) was used to log the digital sonar packets and cable counter data.  Data were 
       captured at an 300m range scale setting.
    Purpose: These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public.  The data can be 
       used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display benthic information.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Not Tested
  Completeness_Report: Unknown
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Accuracy of the horizontal coordinates is on the order of 10-30m based on the uncertainty 
        in position of side scan sonar towfish relative to ships gps position.  Horizontal layback is more accurate than lateral 
        offsets since any lateral offset in the towfish position (due to side currents) is unaccounted for in the layback calculations.
