  Description: 
    Abstract: Backscatter extracted from gridded bathymetry of the banktops and shelf environments of Guam, of the Mariana Islands
      Archipelago.
    Purpose: This acoustic backscatter imagery was created using data gathered from multibeam soundings for use as a planning and
      reference document. Refer to supplemental information for description of instrument and survey.
    Supplemental_Information: Data were collected aboard the R/V AHI (Acoustic Habitat Investigator),a 25' survey launch owned and operated by the
      NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center in Honolulu, HI.  The R/V AHI's survey sensors include a 240 kHz RESON
      8101-ER sonar providing bathymetry and imagery data, a TSS/Applanix POS/MV Model 320 which measures position,
      velocity, attitude and heading, and a Seabird SBE 19 CTD used to measure sound velocity profiles.
      
      Equipment serial numbers and software versions are as follows:

      R/V AHI Lever Arm Distances and Alignment Offsets
      The R/V AHI Reference Point (RP) is defined to be the intersection of the vessel's centerline, the cabin deck and
      the bulkhead immediately aft of the transducer.  This is marked by a punch in the deck weld at that location.
      Positive X means the point is forward of the RP, positive Y means the point is to starboard of the RP, positive Z
      means the point is below the RP.  The loaded waterline is defined as the intersection of the vessel's performance
      wing with the hull at the transom.

    Process_Step: 
      Process_Description: Science Applications International Corporation's (SAIC) ISS-2000 acquires, processes and records data, provides
        survey control and underway quality control displays.  SAIC's SABER processing software is used to process the raw
        soundings, analyze the results, manually edit the sounding data to remove outliers and derive average gridded data values.
        The data have been corrected for observed tides from Guam tide gauge 1630000 with a time corrector of 18 minutes
        and a tide height multiplier of 0.94 using SABER postprocessing software.  The data were also recorrected for
        observed sound velocities in postprocessing.
        Hawaii Mapping Research Group (HMRG) processing software was then used to extract values of acoustic intensity from
        the soundings. HMRG is an organization of scientists, engineers and technicians whose mission is to design, build,
        and operate tools for mapping the seafloor. HMRG is a group within the School of Ocean and Earth Science and
        Technology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The gsf2mr program (July, 2003) converts the swath bathymetry ping
        records contained within a GSF (Generic Sensor Format) version 2.02 dataset into mr1file format. This is done as
        follows: (i) position each beam's bottom detect intensity sample at the across-track location of that beam's
        bathymetry value; (ii) assuming a flat bottom in the near neighborhood of the beam, compute across-track distances
        for all of the beam's remaining intensity samples based on their temporal relation to the bottom detect sample and
        the computed average sound velocity for that beam as derived from its range and travel time; (iii) after all of the
        intensity samples from all beams of a ping have been located in across-track distance, fill the gaps between them
        as necessary by interpolation.
        The conversion described above is necessary in order to run HMRG backscatter processing operations on the data,
        such as filtering to remove noise, and to create netCDF grids, raster images and geotiffs.
        GMT was then used to reformat the acoustic imagery when necessary. Interactive Visualization System's Fledermaus,
        ESRI ArcGIS, and RSI ENVI were used for viewing results and creating browse objects.

  Overview_Description: 
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview: Sidescan data within a GSF file are arranged as small sequences of intensity
      values, one sequence per beam per ping. The intensity values represent the
      amplitude of echo returns to the sensor and can be related to seabed
      roughness.
