PRESENT:  Amestoy, C.J., Dooley, Morse and Skoglund, JJ., and Zimmerman, D.J., 
  Specially Assigned


       DOOLEY, J.   Central Vermont Public Service Corporation (CVPS) brings
  this interlocutory  appeal from a decision of the Public Service Board
  holding that it may consider in a rate case  whether the cost of power CVPS
  purchases from Hydro-Quebec (HQ) may be excluded, in whole or  in part,
  from expenses covered by utility rates.  CVPS argues that the Board was
  precluded under  principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel or
  equitable estoppel from considering whether CVPS  acted prudently by
  entering into, and waiving termination rights with respect to, a
  thirty-year  purchase power contract with HQ in August 1991, and whether
  the power purchased from HQ is  uneconomical and therefore not "used and
  useful."

 <Page 2>

       We hold that the Board (FN1) is collaterally estopped, based on its
  prior determinations in a  1994 rate case, from considering further whether
  CVPS acted imprudently by locking into the HQ  contract in August 1991.  We
  conclude that it is premature to determine whether the Board may take  any
  further action in this rate case based on the imprudence it found in the
  1994 rate case.  Finally,  we remand for further proceedings on whether the
  Board may determine if the power purchased from  HQ is useful.  In all
  other respects, the order of the Board is affirmed.

       A brief history of the HQ contract is helpful to understand the
  context in which these issues  come before us.  In 1987, the Vermont Joint
  Owners (VJO) of the Highgate interconnection facilities - a group of nine
  Vermont utilities that included CVPS - entered into a contract to purchase 
  electricity from HQ over a thirty-year period, from 1990 to 2020.   In
  1988, the contract was  amended to extend the time until April 30, 1991,
  for any party to terminate the contract if necessary  regulatory approvals
  were withheld or tendered upon terms unsatisfactory to that party.  In
  1991, the  Board granted interim approval for both the HQ contract and a
  participation agreement between the  nine Vermont utilities.  See 30 V.S.A.
  § 248(a) (requiring Board to issue certificate of public good  before
  utility may purchase energy from outside Vermont for period exceeding five
  years).  We  affirmed the Board's order in In re Petition of Twenty-Four
  Vt. Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295  (1992) (HQ I).

       In early 1991, HQ informed VJO that it was not satisfied with a
  condition of the regulatory 

 <Page 3>

  approval it obtained from the National Energy Board of Canada and was
  appealing that condition to  the Canadian Federal Court of Appeals. 
  Consequently, HQ sought to extend the deadline for  terminating the
  contract based on its dissatisfaction with a regulatory requirement.  In
  April 1991, the  parties signed a waiver and release, extending the
  parties' right to terminate the contract on the basis  of unsatisfactory
  regulatory approvals until December 1, 1991.  On April 30, 1991, the Board 
  approved the waiver and release, and this Court affirmed the Board's order
  in In re Petition of  Twenty-Four Vt. Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309
  (1992) (HQ II).

       In July 1991, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeals affirmed the
  export license to HQ and  struck down the condition to which HQ had
  objected, and HQ informed VJO that it was willing to  commit to the
  contract at that time despite the uncertainty of an appeal to the Canadian
  Supreme  Court.  On August 28, 1991, HQ agreed to forego its regulatory
  termination right, thereby waiving  any right to terminate the agreement in
  the event the Supreme Court of Canada reinstated the  unsatisfactory
  regulatory condition.  VJO responded on August 29, agreeing to waive any
  right to  terminate the contract based on unsatisfactory regulatory
  conditions.  As do the parties and the  Board, we refer to the action of
  waiving the termination right as locking into the contract. The Board  did
  not review the early lock-in decision at the time because it concluded that
  it did not have  jurisdiction to review the matter while HQ I and HQ II
  were pending in this Court.

       In February 1992, the Board approved the allocation of HQ electricity
  to the individual  utilities, a condition of its earlier contract approval,
  and this Court affirmed that decision in In re  Twenty-Four Electric
  Utilities, 160 Vt. 227, 627 A.2d 355 (1993) (HQ III).  In October 1994, the 
  Board granted CVPS a rate increase of 4.27 percent in the first litigated
  CVPS rate increase to  include HQ contract costs (the 1994 rate case).  As
  discussed in more detail below, in 1994, the  Public Service Department had
  argued that CVPS should not be able to recover in rates the full HQ 
  contract costs because CVPS was imprudent in locking into the contract and
  the purchased power  was not used and useful at the price set in the
  contract.  In reaching its decision, the Board found that  CVPS made a
  management error in prematurely locking into the contract and, as a result
  of this and 

 <Page 4>

  other findings, reduced CVPS's allowed rate of return by 75 basis points. 
  It rejected the  Department's theory that the costs of HQ power above what
  other sources would cost, over the life of  the HQ contract, was not used
  and useful.  The Board's decision was not appealed to this Court.

       In September 1997, CVPS filed with the Board a petition to increase
  its rates by 6.6 percent,  seeking a revenue increase of $15.4 million. 
  Several organizations moved to intervene and for  appointment of
  independent counsel to oppose rate increases associated with the HQ
  contract.  CVPS  objected on the grounds that res judicata, collateral
  estoppel or equitable estoppel precluded  relitigation of issues concerning
  the HQ contract, as they were resolved in the 1994 rate case.  The  Board
  granted the motions to intervene and appointed an independent investigator
  to present  evidence on CVPS's decisions to negotiate, execute, lock in,
  and manage its contract with HQ.  

       In January 1998, CVPS moved to expedite the decision on preclusion,
  and in February  moved twice to strike prefiled testimony pertaining to the
  HQ contract issues.  In April 1998, the  Board determined that it was not
  precluded in this rate case from considering the prudence of  CVPS's
  decision to enter into the HQ contract, particularly the early lock-in
  decision, and the  usefulness of power supplied by the contract in relation
  to other power that could be obtained at  lower costs (the 1998 decision). 
  Specifically, it ruled that: (1) res judicata, or claim preclusion, does 
  not apply in rate cases; (2) collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion,
  applies but has no preclusive  effect in this case because the issues
  actually litigated in the 1994 rate case were different from those 
  presented in this case; and (3) the elements of equitable estoppel are not
  satisfied in this case.  On  April 30, the Board granted CVPS permission to
  take an interlocutory appeal to this Court on the  preclusion issues and
  stayed further proceedings pending the appeal.  CVPS argues here that each
  of  the Board's reasons for rejecting the 1994 rate case as preclusive is
  wrong.

                               I. Introduction

       Generally, in reviewing decisions of the Board, "we give great
  deference to the particular  expertise and informed judgment of the Board." 
  In re Vermont Power Exchange, 159 Vt. 168, 179,  617 A.2d 418, 424 (1992). 
  We uphold findings of fact unless clearly erroneous.  See id.  "Our 

 <Page 5>

  standard of review is based, however, on the nature of the Board's
  expertise and the appropriateness  of paying deference to it."  Id.  The
  applicability of judicially-created doctrines such as claim  preclusion or
  issue preclusion in rate cases is not an issue within the Board's expertise
  of utility law.   Moreover, whether preclusion applies to a given set of
  facts is a question of law, which we review de  novo.  See State v.
  Pollander, 167 Vt. 301, 304, 706 A.2d 1359, 1360 (1997).  Thus, we give no 
  deference to the Board's decisions on claim preclusion and issue
  preclusion.

       The doctrine of res judicata, also called claim preclusion, "bars the
  litigation of a claim or  defense if there exists a final judgment in
  former litigation in which the 'parties, subject matter and  causes of
  action are identical or substantially identical.'"  Berlin Convalescent
  Ctr. v. Stoneman, 159  Vt. 53, 56, 615 A.2d 141, 143 (1992) (quoting
  Berisha v. Hardy, 144 Vt. 136, 138, 474 A.2d 90, 91  (1984)).  The doctrine
  does not require that the claims were actually litigated in the prior
  proceeding;  rather, it applies to claims that were or should have been
  litigated in the prior proceeding.  See Lamb  v. Geovjian, 165 Vt. 375,
  380, 683 A.2d 731, 734-35 (1996).  For example, res judicata applies to 
  both affirmative defenses that could have been raised before, see id. at
  381, 683 A.2d at 735, and  compulsory counterclaims that should have been
  raised before, but not to permissive counterclaims.   See Cold Springs Farm
  Dev., Inc. v. Ball, 163 Vt. 466, 473, 661 A.2d 89, 93 (1995).

       The doctrine of collateral estoppel, also called issue preclusion, is
  similar in effect but more  narrow in scope.  See Berlin Convalescent Ctr.,
  159 Vt. at 56, 615 A.2d at 144.  It bars the  relitigation of an issue,
  rather than a claim, that was actually litigated by the parties and decided
  in a  prior case.  See id.  The elements of collateral estoppel are: (1)
  preclusion is asserted against one who  was a party in the prior action;
  (2) the same issue was raised in the prior action;  (3) the issue was 
  resolved by a final judgment on the merits; (4) there was a full and fair
  opportunity to litigate the  issue in the prior action; and (5) applying
  preclusion is fair.  See State v. Dann, 167 Vt. 119, 126,  702 A.2d 105,
  110 (1997).

       The purposes of both claim preclusion and issue preclusion are: (1) to
  conserve the resources  of courts and litigants by protecting them against
  piecemeal or repetitive litigation; (2) to prevent

 <Page 6>

  vexatious litigation; (3) to promote the finality of judgments and
  encourage reliance on judicial  decisions; and (4) to decrease the chances
  of inconsistent adjudication.  See Berlin Convalescent  Ctr., 159 Vt. at
  57, 60, 615 A.2d at 144-46; Ball, 163 Vt. at 473, 661 A.2d at 94.  We keep
  these  purposes in mind in determining whether either doctrine applies in
  the rate cases before us.  See  Berlin Convalescent Ctr., 159 Vt. at 60,
  615 A.2d at 145-46 (in resolving whether to apply issue  preclusion, we
  balance desire not to deprive litigant of adequate day in court against
  desire to prevent  repetitious litigation of essentially same dispute).

                           II. Collateral Estoppel

       We begin with collateral estoppel because CVPS argues that the issues
  the Department raises  in this case are issues that were actually litigated
  in the 1994 rate case.  As noted above, the Board  found that collateral
  estoppel applies in rate proceedings, but that the issues actually
  litigated in the  1994 rate case were different from those before it in
  this case. (FN2)  We agree that collateral  estoppel or issue preclusion
  generally applies in administrative proceedings, see  In re Carrier, 155 
  Vt. 152, 157-58, 582 A.2d 110, 113 (1990), and may apply in a utility rate
  case if all five elements  are met, see Vermont Power Exchange, 159 Vt. at
  181, 617 A.2d at 425 (utility precluded in rate  case by collateral
  estoppel from relitigating issues resolved in previous case).  CVPS
  contends that  both the prudence of the August 1991 lock-in of the HQ
  contract and the usefulness of power under  that contract were litigated
  and resolved in its 1994 rate case.  Thus, we start with detailing what 
  occurred in that case.

 <Page 7>

  The 1994 rate case began in November 1993 when the Board issued an order
  opening an  investigation into CVPS's rates.  The order lists the elements
  of the investigation, including:

    Power costs.  Has the Company prudently acquired its generation 
    entitlements, both purchased and owned?  Has it prudently managed 
    its power costs, including off-system sales (in particular, of
    Hydro-Quebec power) and nuclear decommissioning costs?  Market
    prices  for oil and gas are at their lowest levels in recent
    years, and further  declines are predicted; what savings should
    those changes produce for  ratepayers?

  In February 1994, CVPS filed a request to increase rates, which was
  consolidated with the  investigation case.  In early May 1994, the Board
  sent the parties a memorandum listing the issues  upon which the parties
  were to offer evidence at the formal proceeding, including: "Was the
  decision  to accelerate the 'lock-in' date of the Hydro-Quebec/VJO contract
  appropriate?"  Later in the month,  the Board sent a second memorandum
  indicating that the primary intent of the Board's questions was  to
  evaluate CVPS's management of resources during 1989-1994, including HQ
  entitlements, and not  to focus on the prudence of resource acquisitions
  prior to 1989.

       CVPS submitted detailed prefiled testimony explaining why CVPS
  believed its actions  leading to and including the early lock-in were
  prudent. The Department also submitted prefiled  testimony on these issues. 
  The main expert testimony came from Dr. Richard Rosen of Tellus  Institute
  in Massachusetts.  Dr. Rosen stated that the only significant resource
  acquisition that  required a prudence review for the five-year period in
  issue was the HQ contract.  To determine the  prudency of the lock-in
  decision, he looked at the four-to-six-month period before that decision
  was  made.  He found that no coherent economic analysis of the overall
  benefit of the contract was done in  that period even though it was clear
  that projections showed the benefits, if any, were declining from  month to
  month.  He concluded that he could not determine "that the Company was
  prudent in  locking into the HQ contract in August, 1991" because of
  inadequate documentation of the  company's decision making.  He concluded,
  however, that the company was "irresponsible" in not  documenting its
  decision making and that because the risk of a bad economic decision was
  great, and  growing in the summer of 1991,  "the Company has substantial
  responsibility for the outcome 

 <Page 8>

  of the economic risks it took in August, 1991 by locking into the HQ
  contract."

       Dr. Rosen also testified that CVPS's "power supply portfolio will be
  excessively costly to its  ratepayers over the next 20 years, or so," and
  the "excess costs derive in large part from the HQ  contract."  On the
  usefulness of the HQ power at the contract price, he concluded that the
  excess cost  of the power, above the price of alternative power available,
  was not "useful" as that term is used in  traditional utility regulation. 
  He concluded that the excess costs of CVPS's power supply, totaling  $79
  million dollars over the life of the contract, should be shared fifty
  percent each between the  ratepayers and the shareholders of CVPS because
  this split reflects "a reasonable balancing of the  risks and
  responsibilities that the Company management and various agencies
  representing the public  took in approving the HQ contract and other
  problematic elements of the Company's current supply  portfolio."

       In rebuttal testimony, CVPS strongly challenged Dr. Rosen's theory -
  on when a generating  asset, including a purchased power contract, was
  economically useful - as a radical departure from  traditional rate-making
  theory that would impose an inappropriate and asymmetric burden on CVPS 
  and its shareholders.  The Department submitted Dr. Rosen's surrebuttal
  testimony, supporting his  original conclusion and arguing that his
  approach to economic usefulness of power sources was  consistent with
  traditional utility regulation theory.

       The Board then held twenty days of hearings during July, August and
  September of 1994.   Following the hearings, both parties submitted briefs
  addressing at length the prudence of the HQ  contract and the early
  lock-in, as well as the usefulness of the HQ power at the contract price,
  and the  consequences of holding it not useful.  

       On October 31, 1994, the Board issued its decision, including findings
  and conclusions on  the HQ contract in general, the usefulness of the power
  provided by it at the contract price and the  early lock-in decision. 
  Concerning the lock-in, the Board made extensive findings on the period 
  before the lock-in decision, including (1) the relationship of that
  decision to HQ's agreement to buy  back some of the power; (2) the changing
  demand and supply situation, which was making the 

 <Page 9>

  contract less beneficial as time passed; and (3) CVPS's analyses, or lack
  of analyses, on the benefits  of the contract.  The Board noted that in
  February 1991, CVPS had estimated that its share of the HQ  contract had a
  net present value of $65 million.  In April, the estimate of the benefit
  had ranged from  $45 million to $16.2 million, and in July, the estimate
  had been about $16 million.  In addition, the  early year losses - due to
  above-market costs during the first years of the contract - continued
  further  into the future.  Based on its findings, the Board, in essence,
  adopted Dr. Rosen's opinion on  prudency.  Thus, the Board determined that
  CVPS had "failed to adequately document its  assessments of the risks
  associated with the declining economics of its entitlements" and concluded:

    In the absence of any detailed economic analysis of and
    consideration  of the alternatives to the HQ Contract during the
    six-month period  prior to the lock in (August 28, 1991), the
    prudence of the Company's  decision to lock in cannot be
    established. However, the failure to  perform the requisite
    analysis during this period was imprudent.

  (Emphasis added.)  In its discussion, the Board found a number of
  management "errors," including:  (1) the "decision to prematurely lock in
  the HQ contract before considering all possible alternative  strategies for
  managing the Contract and potential return sales;" (2) the "failure to have
  developed an  assessment of the appropriate level of return sales prior to
  beginning serious negotiations with  Hydro-Quebec;" (3) the failure to
  negotiate a return sale for a period in excess of five years; and (4) a 
  pattern of providing misleading information to the public and the Board. 
  The Board noted that it  took CVPS's failure to produce documentation of
  any coherent analyses done in the period  immediately before the lock-in
  decision as "evidence that the required analyses were simply not 
  undertaken or were purposely not documented."

       The Board, however, rejected Dr. Rosen's proposed analysis of the
  usefulness of the power  costs and his proposed remedy of sharing the
  excess costs between the ratepayers and the  shareholders of CVPS.  It
  reasoned:

    In essence, the Department's "economic used and useful (or  excess
    capacity) test" is a market-based approach and operates, in  part,
    on the logic that ratepayers should not have to pay more for 
    electricity than it would - at one specific point in time - cost
    to  purchase on the open market.  That idea has an obvious appeal, 
    particularly in situations where embedded monopoly costs exceed 

 <Page 10>

    market costs.  However, for the reasons which follow, we conclude 
    that under current conditions Dr. Rosen's proposed adjustment is 
    flawed and must, therefore, be rejected.

    . . . .
    Dr. Rosen's proposal differs from our traditional method in a 
    very critical way.  He states that his test can be applied at any
    time  during the life of a prudently-acquired asset to determine
    its used-and-usefulness; the effect would be that costs incurred
    at a time when  the resource was deemed economically used and
    useful would remain  at risk for a potential future disallowance. 
    This test could also be  applied to a resource portfolio as a
    whole, which in fact is what Dr.  Rosen did in this case.  It is
    this aspect of the proposal - the life-cycle  analysis of an
    existing resource, which includes past and projected  costs - that
    the Company argues constitutes retroactive ratemaking.   In this
    way, contends the Company, it is arbitrary and capricious.

         The Company's arguments have merit.  As structured, Dr. 
    Rosen's test would penalize investors for prudent investments that 
    are, or had been, reasonably expected to yield net present value 
    benefits over their lifetime, that are not excessive in scope, and
    that  are still in service, but whose costs may exceed market
    prices at a  particular moment in time.  In this way . . ., Dr.
    Rosen's ratemaking  approach may discourage utilities from making
    least-cost investments  that fail a short-term market
    cost-effectiveness test.

         When a utility petitions the Board to recognize an asset in 
    rates, we may conduct an investigation into the prudence and used-
    and-usefulness of that asset.  If an explicit review is conducted,
    those  asset costs that are found to be prudently incurred and
    economically  justified at the time the asset is put into service
    are allowed into rates.  Only one-half of the costs associated
    with the non-used-and-useful  portions of the asset, if any, are
    put into rates.

         After such a review, if an asset is "explicitly approved for 
    placement in rate base" and its costs are deemed used and useful,
    it  would be inappropriate to subject their continued recovery
    over many  years to a year-by-year market test.

         Dr. Rosen's proposal also raises another concern; it would 
    impose additional risks upon shareholders without offering 
    commensurate returns for them.  His approach provides that 
    ratepayers will pay the lower of either embedded (historic) cost
    or  market cost for a resource.  If market cost is lower than
    embedded  cost, shareholders will recover only one-half of the
    difference.  In  contrast, however, if market cost exceeds
    embedded, shareholders  will recover only the full embedded costs:
    the difference between  market costs and embedded costs flows to
    the ratepayers in the form  of below-market electricity rates.

         In competitive markets, a company will not be able to recover 
    costs that exceed the market costs of its products.  Investors
    bear the  risk that their investments will be uneconomic, in full
    or in part.   However, that risk is symmetrical, which is to say
    that investors also  reap additional benefits if they are able to
    produce their product at a  cost well below its market price.  Dr.
    Rosen's portfolio adjustment  proposal does not offer CVPS's
    investors that opportunity and,  therefore, must be rejected.

 <Page 11>

         We note, however, that our ruling in the present matter
    should  not be construed as a finding that a market-value test is
    fundamentally  acceptable. . . .  As utility markets become more
    open and  competitive, it may become increasingly possible and, in
    many cases,  desirable to employ market-based tests to govern the
    utility's total  return.

  Based on this rationale, the Board rejected imposing any cost disallowance. 
  Rather, it imposed a 75-basis-point reduction in return on equity as the
  penalty for  CVPS's "mismanagement of power  supply options" and "failed
  efforts to acquire all cost-effective energy efficiency resources."  
  Neither  party appealed the Board's decision.

                                 A. Prudence

       To determine whether the 1994 rate case has any preclusive effect, we
  examine the prudency  issues separately from the used-and-useful issue and
  apply the five elements of collateral estoppel to  each issue, beginning
  with those related to prudency.  First, it is undisputed that the first
  element is  met because CVPS is asserting collateral estoppel against a
  party - that is, the Department - who  was a party in the prior action.
  (FN3) The Department has not argued otherwise.

       The second element requires that the same issue was raised in the
  earlier proceeding.  This  element is complicated because, here, the
  Department claims, through its expert witness, that CVPS  acted imprudently
  in eleven different ways.  The witness stated in prefiled testimony that
  some of the  allegedly imprudent actions occurred during the period from
  1986 to 1990, while CVPS was  negotiating the contract, on its own behalf
  and then for the Vermont Joint Owners, and then seeking  approval for the
  contract from the Board.  It is clear that none of these imprudency
  theories were  solicited by the Board in 1994, and none were presented by
  the Department.  Thus, CVPS has not  established this element for these
  theories. (FN4)

 <Page 12>

       The remainder of the imprudency theories advanced by the Department
  involve the period in  1991 leading up to the decision to lock in the
  contract, and the lock-in decision itself.  The Board  addressed this
  period in the 1994 rate case.  Nevertheless, the Board concluded that the
  prudency  issues raised by the Department in this case are different from
  those presented in the 1994 case  because, in the 1994 case: (1) "the
  Department ultimately decided not to litigate the issue of whether  the
  Company's entry into and management of the Contract (including its decision
  to lock in the  Contract) were prudent;" and (2) instead, the Department
  presented the issue of whether CVPS  mismanaged its entire power supply
  portfolio.  We conclude that the Board's first distinction is  inaccurate,
  and the second, although more accurate, is irrelevant.

       First, we note that, in the 1994 case, the Board ordered the parties
  to specifically address  whether the lock-in decision was prudent.  Thus,
  the parties were not at liberty to "ultimately decide  not to litigate the
  issue," as the Board states in its 1998 decision.  CVPS had the burden of
  proof in  establishing that the lock-in decision was prudent.  See In re
  Green Mountain Power Corp., 147 Vt.  509, 519, 519 A.2d 595, 601 (1986)
  (utility has burden of showing prudence of its decisions). (FN5)  It
  vigorously and thoroughly addressed the issue raised by the Board.  Insofar
  as the evidence  submitted to the Board was insufficient to establish the
  prudence of the lock-in, the conclusion that  must be drawn is that the
  decision to lock in was imprudent.  See Coalition of Cities for Affordable 
  Utility Rates v. Public Utility Comm'n, 798 S.W.2d 560, 563-64 (Tex. 1990)
  (utility has burden of  proving prudence of expenditure and is not entitled
  to second trial to present more evidence where 
  
 <Page 13>

  it fails to meet burden). 

       The Board states, however, that "the Department elected not to present
  testimony either  challenging the prudence of the Company's decision to
  lock in the Contract or supporting that  decision."  (Emphasis added).  The
  record shows otherwise.  As set out above, the Department  presented the
  testimony of Dr. Rosen who stated that he could not conclude that the
  lock-in decision  was prudent, and that CVPS was imprudent in not
  documenting its decision-making process in the  summer of 1991.   Dr.
  Rosen's testimony supported a conclusion that CVPS was imprudent, and the 
  Department argued for this conclusion.

       When we compare the testimony that the Department is prepared to offer
  in this case with the  testimony it presented in 1994, we see that it
  intends to present a more thorough, aggressive and  detailed case than it
  did in1994.  Indeed, there is an indication that, in the 1994 case, the
  Board was  frustrated with the quality of the Department's presentation,
  (FN6) and the Board did not accept the  main part of Dr. Rosen's testimony
  dealing with the usefulness of the HQ power at the contract price.  In
  applying issue preclusion, however, the question is whether an issue was
  litigated in the past, not  whether it was litigated well. The record shows
  that the issue of the prudency of CVPS's action in  evaluating its options
  in 1991 and locking into the HQ contract was litigated in 1994.

       The Board also concluded that the issue presented in 1994 was
  different because the  Department contested the prudency of the management
  of all of CVPS's power resources.  Thus,  the  Department argues here that
  the Board did not decide that CVPS's actions leading to its decision to 
  lock into the HQ contract were imprudent, but rather decided that CVPS had
  a pattern of  mismanaging its overall power supply portfolio.  We agree
  that the Department submitted evidence  on CVPS's overall management of its
  power supply portfolio, and the Board made general  conclusions concerning
  that management. The Board made clear, however, that the most significant

 <Page 14>

  CVPS action, and the one with the greatest impact on rates, was its
  decision to lock in the HQ  contract early.  Thus, the Board directed the
  parties to submit specific evidence on the prudency of  that action, and
  the parties did so. (FN7)  The Department's responsive testimony was that
  of Dr.  Rosen, and he stated "I will only address the [Board's] questions
  with reference to the Company's  decision to acquire the Hydro-Quebec
  contract, since that is the only major resource to be initially  acquired
  since 1989."   

       If CVPS were arguing that the 1994 decision was preclusive with
  respect to a power source  other than HQ, we would understand the
  Department's argument.  In 1994, however, the Board was  focused primarily
  on the HQ power, and Dr. Rosen's testimony on prudence addressed only the
  HQ  lock-in decision.  Under these circumstances, the presence of other
  resource management issues is  largely irrelevant to whether CVPS has
  established the second element of collateral estoppel.  We  hold that it
  has established this element as to the prudency of actions it took leading
  up to the  decision to lock into the contract, and the prudency of its
  lock-in decision.

       The third element requires that the issue actually litigated was
  resolved by a final judgment  on the merits.  Much of our discussion above
  applies to this element.  The conclusion reached by the  Board - that the
  prudence of CVPS's decision to lock into the HQ contract cannot be
  established due  to the absence of any detailed economic analysis of the
  alternatives to the contract during the six-month period prior to the
  lock-in - is the same conclusion that the Department urged the Board to 
  reach based on the testimony of Dr. Rosen.  In fact, the Board went further
  and concluded that  CVPS's actions leading to and including the early
  lock-in decision were integral parts of the pattern  of mismanagement by
  CVPS.   Thus, it found that the evidence demonstrated CVPS's "significant 

 <Page 15>

  failures and errors of judgment" in power-cost management decisions between
  April and October  1991, including, first and foremost "[t]he decision to
  prematurely lock in the HQ Contract before  considering all possible
  alternative strategies for managing the Contract and potential return
  sales."   The historical facts concerning the early lock-in decision, the
  lack of analysis and documentation in  the months preceding the August 1991
  lock-in decision, and the prudence of CVPS's actions and  decisions in this
  regard were litigated and resolved by the Board in the 1994 rate case.

       The Board's decision in the 1994 rate case became a final judgment on
  the merits when  neither party appealed it to this Court.  Nevertheless,
  relying on Zingher v. Department of Aging and  Disabilities, 163 Vt. 566,
  664 A.2d 256 (1995), the Department argues that the Board's decision was 
  not final on these issues because the Board reserved the right to
  reconsider the issues in future  proceedings.  In Zingher, we held that an
  administrative decision was not final, and therefore did not  have
  preclusive effect, because the plain language of the order left open the
  possibility of later  review.  See id. at 571, 664 A.2d at 258
  (petitioner's request should be denied at the present time  because
  petitioner has yet to show that services are necessary to his obtaining
  employment).  Here,  we need not decide whether the Board has the authority
  to reserve the right to retry an issue where  there has been a failure of
  evidence because there is no such reservation in the Board's decision in
  the  1994 rate case.  Cf. Coalition of Cities, 798 S.W.2d at 564
  (concluding that public utility  commission does not have authority to
  reserve right to rehear prudence issue in subsequent  proceeding where
  utility failed to present sufficient evidence to prove prudence).  Contrary
  to the  Department's contention, statements by the Board in decisions
  issued prior to the 1994 rate case  indicating that the prudence of the HQ
  lock-in would be decided in a future rate case do not support  the
  contention that the 1994 rate case did not decide that issue.

       Related to the third element of a final judgment on the merits is the
  requirement that the  issues be necessary to the previous decision.  Our
  review of the record in the 1994 rate case indicates  that resolution of
  the HQ prudence issues was necessary to the Board's decision in determining
  the  appropriate penalty to impose against CVPS for excessive power costs. 
  Despite the Department's

 <Page 16>

  request for a disallowance of HQ power costs, and the Board's determination
  that CVPS was  imprudent in failing to do adequate analysis before locking
  into the contract, the Board rejected any  disallowance of costs, imposing
  instead a 75-basis-point reduction in return on equity.  Based on the 
  detailed decision of the Board, we have no doubt that it considered
  carefully the events during the six  months prior to the lock-in and the
  lock-in decision in determining the appropriate penalty.    

       The fourth and fifth elements of collateral estoppel - whether there
  was a full and fair  opportunity to litigate the prudence issues in the
  1994 rate case, and whether it is fair to apply  preclusion here - are
  generally considered together.  Among the factors to consider are the
  choice of  forum, the incentive to litigate, the foreseeability of future
  litigation, the legal standards and burdens  in each action, the procedural
  opportunities of each forum, and the possibility of inconsistent 
  determinations.  See Trepanier v. Getting Organized, Inc., 155 Vt. 259,
  265, 583 A.2d 583, 587  (1990).  The party opposing application of
  collateral estoppel has the burden of showing that  circumstances make it
  appropriate for an issue to be relitigated.  See id. at 265-66, 583 A.2d at
  587-88.  We conclude that there was a full and fair opportunity to
  litigate the prudence issues related to  the lock-in in the 1994 rate case. 
  Both the prior and instant actions were brought by CVPS in the  same forum
  to increase its rates; thus, the standards, burdens and procedures, as well
  as the incentive  to litigate were all the same.  The Department has not
  shown that it was deprived of an adequate day  in court.  Accordingly, it
  is fair to apply preclusion here to prevent repetitious litigation of the
  same  issues.  See id. at 266, 583 A.2d at 588 (critical inquiry is whether
  party to be bound had full and fair  opportunity to contest issue resolved
  in earlier action so that it is fair to refuse relitigation of same 
  issue); see also Berlin Convalescent Ctr., 159 Vt. at 60, 615 A.2d at
  145-46 (we balance desire not to  deprive litigant of adequate day in court
  against desire to prevent repetitious litigation).

       The Department argues that it is not fair to apply collateral estoppel
  here for several reasons,  but notably does not assert that it was denied a
  full and fair opportunity to litigate the prudence issues  in the previous
  rate case.  Instead, the Department contends that the application of
  collateral  estoppel: (1) will turn each rate case into an expensive,
  unworkable litigated proceeding because it 

 <Page 17>

  will prevent later litigation of any issue that could have been litigated;
  (2) will significantly  undermine the Board's authority to protect the
  public and ensure that ratepayers bear only just and  reasonable costs; and
  (3) will result in ratepayers bearing all the substantial above-market
  costs  associated with the HQ contract.  Consequently, the Department
  contends that the interests in finality  underlying the doctrine of
  collateral estoppel are outweighed by the public policy concerns involved 
  in regulating a monopoly and the serious harm to the public that will
  result by applying it here. 

       We briefly outline our disagreement with the Department's arguments. 
  First, we are dealing  here only with issue preclusion.  Thus, the
  Department's concern that preclusive effect may flow  from everything that
  could have been litigated in 1994 is misguided.  Second, our earlier
  decisions to  apply issue preclusion in rate cases mean that we have
  concluded that expensive and time-consuming  relitigation of contested
  issues is in the interest of neither the public nor the utilities. "The
  same  finality that benefits the utility investors can serve the interests
  of consumers who know that if a  utility is once denied relief because of
  its failure to prove its case, it may not return repeatedly on the  facts
  until the [Board] yields."  Coalition of Cities, 798 S.W.2d at 565. 
  Moreover, finality of  decisions also conserves the resources of the
  administrative tribunal.

       Finally, we recognize that the financial impact on ratepayers of the
  cost of the HQ contract is  much greater in 1998 than in 1994 because CVPS
  is obligated to buy a greater quantity of power in  later years under the
  contract.  Nevertheless, the Department was fully aware in 1994 of the
  purchase  terms of the contract and their likely impact on future rates. 
  Indeed, the life-cycle analysis the  Department presented in 1994
  demonstrated that impact dramatically.  Moreover, the Board's 1994  order
  offers at least some protections for ratepayers, as explained infra.  We
  cannot conclude that it is  unfair to apply collateral estoppel on the
  prudency of CVPS's decision to lock into the HQ contract.   Consequently,
  we agree with CVPS that collateral estoppel applies to the Board's 1994
  decision on  the prudency of the lock-in decision.

       On the other hand, we disagree with CVPS's position that the Board is
  also collaterally  estopped by the 1994 decision from declaring any further
  consequences to CVPS.  As the 

 <Page 18>

  Department emphasizes, the Board found CVPS's actions imprudent, not
  prudent.  Some of the  confusion on this point results from the Board's
  decision to label its 75-basis-point reduction of  CVPS's rate of return as
  a penalty, which CVPS argues in turn must be a one-time reduction.  We 
  emphasized in the very recent case of In re Citizens Utility Co. "that the
  purpose of a rate-of-return  reduction is not to penalize a company for
  specific acts of misconduct but rather to set reasonable  rates in cases
  where the consumers are not being adequately served 'due to inefficiency or 
  improvidence or other like reasons.'"  No. 97-436, slip op. at 10 (Vt. Dec.
  15, 2000) (quoting In re  New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 115 Vt. 494, 513, 66
  A.2d 135, 147 (1949)).  Consistent with that  purpose, the Board in the
  1994 rate case imposed the reduction in rate of return to "remain in place 
  until the Company demonstrates, through tangible results, that it has
  eliminated the excessive power  costs imposed on customers by ineffective
  and improvident management decisions, or that it is on a  reasonable and
  equitable path towards doing so."  Irrespective of the Board's label, the
  rate-of-return  reduction - based in part on the imprudence it found - may
  remain in force as long as CVPS's  service is being impaired as a result of
  the high price of its power.  In sum, although the Department  cannot
  relitigate the question of CVPS's prudency in making the lock-in decision,
  the Board may  continue the reduction to CVPS's rate of return based on the
  imprudency it has already found and the  failure of CVPS to eliminate the
  effect of that imprudency on its rates.

       The Board specifically addressed this point in its 1998 decision.  It
  held that, even if it is  required to give preclusive effect to the 1994
  decision, it can continue the reduction to CVPS's rate  of return.  In
  fact, the Board concluded that it can increase the reduction in future
  cases:

    If the Company fails to correct these problems [of excessive
    costs],  the Board plainly retains jurisdiction to impose a
    different remedy to  ensure that ratepayers do not bear the
    financial burden alone.  The  remedies imposed in [the 1994 rate
    case] may be adjusted over time,  as costs and conditions change,
    as a matter of fairness to both the  utility and its ratepayers
    . . . . 
    [T]he appropriate remedy in the earlier docket may no longer be 
    reasonable in light of the new facts and changed Contract power 
    costs.  It is difficult to understand how increased power costs
    could be  used by the Company to justify its request for a rate
    increase, but  could not be used by the Department as a basis for
    requesting a 

 <Page 19>

    modification in the remedies that partially protect the ratepayers
    from  excessive power costs. The Company obviously believes that
    the  Board retains jurisdiction to raise rates in response to the
    changing  Contract costs.  Collateral estoppel is not a bar to
    consideration of a  different remedy based upon higher power costs
    included in this rate  case.

  Although CVPS attacks this holding in general terms, we believe it is
  premature to determine  whether collateral estoppel precludes the Board
  from adopting a modified or increased rate-of-return  reduction in this
  case for the imprudency it found in 1994.  At this point, we can only
  speculate on  what basis the Board may act, and the nature and extent of
  the reduction it might adopt.  Thus, we  leave this issue, if it becomes
  real, to review of the final judgment of the Board should such review  be
  sought.

                            B. Use and Usefulness

       We now consider whether the Board is precluded by collateral estoppel
  from reducing the  amount of HQ power costs that CVPS can recover in its
  rates if the Board concludes that the high  price of that power makes it
  non-useful in part.  Generally, the arguments of the parties and our 
  reasoning on this issue follow our analysis of issue preclusion on the
  prudency of the lock-in  decision, although the nature of the issue may
  require a different result.  On the first element, again,  estoppel is
  asserted against the Department, which was a party in the prior action.

       We have set out above the Board's conclusion in the 1994 rate case. 
  According to the  prefiled testimony of its expert witness on the economics
  of the contract, the position of the  Department in this case is: (1) the
  HQ power purchased by CVPS is used, "but not economically  useful," because
  it will cost $126 million dollars more than market value of the power over
  the term  of the contract; (2) the Board's policy, as expressed in a number
  of decisions, "is to share  uneconomic costs between ratepayers and
  stockholders;" (3) that policy is "fair and efficient;" and  (4) the
  appropriate remedy is to share excess costs between ratepayers and
  shareholders.  The witness  distinguished his testimony from that of Dr.
  Rosen because Rosen's testimony "differed from the  Board's traditional
  method for addressing resources that are not used and useful;" applied the
  "used  and useful test . . . at any time during the life of a
  prudently-acquired asset;" and applied the test to 

 <Page 20>

  CVPS's "resource portfolio as a whole," not just the HQ power.   In its
  1998 order on preclusion, the  Board accepted these differences.  It found
  that the Department presented a novel theory in 1994, that  the theory
  covered all of CVPS's resources and not just the HQ power, and that the
  theory allowed  exclusion of costs if at any point in time the "life-cycle
  cost" of the power exceeded market value.

       On the second element of collateral estoppel, identity of issues, we
  find no real differences  between the issue litigated in 1994 and that
  presented in this case.  In 1994, Dr. Rosen characterized  his position as
  fully consistent with traditional ratemaking theory, although he cited
  out-of-state,  rather than Vermont, cases in support of his theory.  Thus,
  we do not find the Department's current  theory that the above-market costs
  of HQ power are non-useful any more or less novel than Dr.  Rosen's
  position in 1994. (FN8)  In any event, we find the point to be
  insignificant.  We are dealing  here with labels rather than substance. 
  The Department cannot escape the application of collateral  estoppel by
  labeling the same argument as novel in one case and traditional in another. 
  The question  for us is whether the arguments were the same.

       We believe that the Department's position in 1994 was essentially the
  same as its position  today.  Putting aside for the moment what power
  sources are covered by the position, the only  difference suggested is that
  Dr. Rosen testified that the Board could compare the total cost of a  power
  resource to market costs at any point in time, and the current witness
  argues that the Board  should make such a comparison "only at key times in
  the life of a resource."  We have looked  carefully at the testimony of Dr.
  Rosen, as well as that of the Department's current witness, and 

 <Page 21>

  cannot conclude that the timing of comparison is a significant difference. 

       In 1994, Dr. Rosen gave testimony in response to the Board's
  questions, and the timing of the  comparison of costs to determine whether
  power resources were useful did not come up in his initial  testimony. 
  CVPS witnesses attacked the testimony arguing, among other things, that
  predictions of  future cost comparisons would vary depending upon when the
  predictions were made.  Dr. Rosen  answered that the CVPS witnesses raised
  a legitimate concern; specifically, he suggested that "the  degree to which
  each supply resource is useful could be reviewed in general ratecases when 
  warranted."  Although the Board described Dr. Rosen as proposing that the
  comparison be done at  any time, the question of timing played no part in
  the Board's decision as set forth above. 

       We do not view the current Department witness as proposing anything
  significantly different  from Dr. Rosen.  His testimony argues that the
  comparison should be made at "key times" and states  that this is a key
  time because CVPS is requesting that "new costs be put into rates."  Of
  course, the  request that the costs be put into rates has generated a rate
  case, exactly when Dr. Rosen  recommended that the comparison be made.  To
  the extent there is a difference between the  Department's position now and
  that in 1994, it is inconsequential.

       Finally, as with the prudency issue, the Department argues that
  collateral estoppel cannot  apply because the 1994 rate case dealt with all
  of CVPS's power resources, and this case deals only  with HQ power.  In
  1994, Dr. Rosen did propose that the cost of all of CVPS's power sources be 
  compared with predicted market costs for the same power, and that any
  predicted excess costs be  split between the ratepayers and CVPS
  stockholders.  Nonetheless, he itemized the excess costs by  source so that
  the Board had a specific excess cost prediction for HQ power.  As expected,
  HQ costs  constituted a large percentage of the predicted excess costs.

       Again, the Department's argument would be more understandable if it
  were claiming that the  resolution of this case had a preclusive effect on
  litigation in the broader inquiry in the 1994 rate  case.  We fail to see
  how the Department can avoid collateral estoppel from the 1994 case by 
  claiming that it litigated more issues in that case than it is seeking to
  litigate here.  The whole point 

 <Page 22>

  of collateral estoppel is that preclusive effect is determined on an issue
  by issue basis.  The exact  issue that the Department seeks to litigate
  here was litigated in 1994, albeit with others. 

       We also conclude that the third element of collateral estoppel - that
  the issue was actually  litigated and resolved in a final judgment - is met
  with respect to the usefulness of the HQ power.   As we set out above,
  supra, at 8-9, in 1994, the Board clearly rejected the Department's
  argument that  the excess cost of the HQ power purchased by CVPS made it
  non-useful, so CVPS was not entitled  to recover all its costs in rates. 
  That determination was necessary to its decision to allow the full cost  of
  the HQ power to be reflected in rates.

       The Department argues that the Board did not render a final judgment
  on the issue because it  stated that it may employ a market-based approach
  in future cases.  Thus, the Department argues, it is  entitled to try to
  persuade the Board to employ the market-based approach in this case.

       In 1994, the Board rejected the proposition that it could revisit the
  issue - whether power  costs were useful during the life of a
  purchase-power contract - once it had found that, at the time the  contract
  was entered into, it had been prudent to enter into the contract and  the
  power would be  economically useful over its life.  We agree that it left
  open the possibility that it might use a market-value approach in the
  future, and deny recovery of costs that exceed market value, but under very 
  limited circumstances.  It stated: "As utility markets become more open and
  competitive, it may  become increasingly possible and, in many cases,
  desirable to employ market-based tests to govern  the utility's total
  return."



       There is no suggestion in the prefiled testimony, or the Department's
  brief, that utility  markets have become more open and competitive since
  1994.  Thus, while the Department seeks to  rely on the Board's openness to
  a policy shift, it makes no claim that the changed conditions that  would
  underlie that shift are present.  Indeed, we take judicial notice that,
  since 1994, various  proposals have been made in the Legislature and to the
  Board to open electricity markets to retail  competition, but none have
  been adopted.  As far as we can determine, Vermont has essentially the 
  same electric regulatory system as it had in 1994 and that system is based
  on regulation of electric 

 <Page 23>

  service monopolies, not competition.  Thus, we reject the Department's
  contention that the judgment  of the Board was not final with respect to
  the usefulness of the HQ power at its above-market cost.

       For the reasons discussed above concerning prudence, we reject the
  Department's argument  that the fourth and fifth elements of collateral
  estoppel are not met with respect to the usefulness of  the HQ power. 
  Although we do not accept the Department's arguments, there is a related
  reason to  question the application of collateral estoppel to the issue of
  the usefulness of HQ power.  The  prudency question is one of historical
  fact.  The usefulness issue is a question of law, or at least of  utility
  regulation policy.  Courts have often treated issues of law and fact
  differently for purposes of  collateral estoppel.  The Restatement of
  Judgments (Second) recognizes that collateral estoppel  generally applies
  to issues of law, Restatement of Judgments (Second) § 27 (1982), but
  provides  exceptions to the general rule when:

    (2) The issue is one of law and (a) the two actions involve claims
    that  are substantially unrelated, or (b) a new determination is
    warranted in  order to take account of an intervening change in
    the applicable legal  context or otherwise to avoid inequitable
    administration of the laws[.]

  Id. § 28(2).  In this case, the first part of the exception is
  inapplicable; this case and the 1994 rate  case are related.  The second
  prong of the exception is, however, arguably applicable.  See Keystone 
  Water Co. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 474 A.2d 368, 372 (Pa. Commw.
  Ct. 1984) (collateral  estoppel does not apply in rate case with respect to
  an issue on which the law was changed by a  decision of the Pennsylvania
  Supreme Court).  Indeed, it may have more force in administrative  agency
  proceedings because "[a]gencies need more freedom to change policies and
  meet new law  enforcement exigencies."  1 C. Koch, Administrative Law and
  Practice § 6.63, at 512 (1985); see  also Restatement of Judgments (Second)
  § 83 cmt. h (the exception for relitigation of issues of law  "has perhaps
  its most salient application in situations where issue preclusion is
  invoked against the  government in adjudications before an administrative
  agency").

       We cannot fully determine the application of the second prong on the
  current record.  We  know that on February 27, 1998, the Board issued an
  order in the Green Mountain Power 

 <Page 24>

  Corporation (GMP) rate case, which was joined with this case on appeal
  because of an overlap in the  issues, but that case has now been settled. 
  See In re Green Mountain Power Corp., No. 5983 (Vt.  Pub. Serv. Bd. Feb.
  27, 1998).  That decision found the HQ power supplied under the VJO
  contract  to GMP was non-useful because of its excessive cost over its life
  in relation to other available  sources.  In reaching that decision, the
  Board attempted to distinguish its decision in the 1994 CVPS  rate case, on
  the same grounds that we have found unpersuasive in this decision.  Thus,
  we must  view the 1998 GMP order as a decision to fundamentally change
  regulatory policy from that  announced in 1994.

       The Board's preclusion decision in this case was announced one month
  after the GMP  decision was issued.  Apparently, because the Board
  characterized its GMP and CVPS decisions as  consistent, the Department has
  never raised the GMP decision as relevant to the issue preclusion 
  determination before us.  In fact, the Board itself never mentioned the GMP
  decision as relevant to  its preclusion decision.  Thus, we have no
  analysis, either from the Board or from the Department, on  why it would be
  fair or unfair to apply the same policy on the usefulness of
  excessively-costly  purchased power to both of Vermont's largest utilities,
  GMP and CVPS.  The matter is further  complicated by the fact that the GMP
  rate case has now been settled on terms more favorable to  GMP than the
  February 1998 decision reflects.

       We believe that the only prudent action for us to take is to remand
  this interlocutory appeal  back to the Board to evaluate the application of
  collateral estoppel to the issue of the usefulness of  the HQ power under §
  27(b)(2) of the Restatement of Judgments (Second) in light of the new
  events.  Either party may, of course, challenge the Board's evaluation of
  this question by review of the final  rate determination in this Court.

                              III. Res Judicata

       Having determined that collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion,
  prevents relitigation of at  least some of the issues the Department seeks
  to raise in this proceeding, we now consider whether  res judicata, or
  claim preclusion, also applies as argued by CVPS.  As we set out in the
  beginning of 

 <Page 25>

  this opinion, claim preclusion is broader than issue preclusion because it
  applies not only to issues  that were litigated in the prior proceeding,
  but also to issues that should have been litigated.  See  Lamb, 165 Vt. at
  380, 683 A.2d at 734.  It requires, however, that the parties, subject
  matter and  causes of action in the two proceedings be identical or
  substantially identical.  See Berlin  Convalescent Ctr., 159 Vt. at 56, 615
  A.2d at 143.  If it applies, the significance of claim preclusion  to this
  case is that it would preclude relitigation of any claim that should have
  been litigated in the  1994 rate cases.  Thus, CVPS argues that it would
  preclude litigation of any claim that CVPS was  imprudent in negotiating or
  entering into the HQ contract because those claims should have been  raised
  in the 1994 rate case.

       We have not decided whether claim preclusion is applicable in rate
  cases.  In general, the  doctrine applies to administrative decisions if
  the administrative agency acts in a judicial capacity,  and the proceeding
  resulting in the decision included the essential elements of adjudication. 
  See  Delozier v. State, 160 Vt. 426, 429, 631 A.2d 228, 230 (1993).  "These
  elements include adequate  notice to interested parties, the right of
  parties to present evidence and legal argument, final  judgment, and
  procedural elements necessary to afford fair determination of the matter in
  light of the  magnitude and complexity of the matter."  Id.  It cannot be
  disputed that proceedings before the  Board contain each of the essential
  elements of adjudication.  

       The Department argues, however, that claim preclusion is not
  applicable in rate cases  because these proceedings are legislative, rather
  than judicial, in nature.  The determination of a just  and reasonable rate
  of return has long been recognized as a policy decision involving numerous 
  policy considerations.  See Allied Chemical v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.,
  528 N.E.2d 153, 156  (N.Y. 1988).  Therefore, courts, including this Court,
  have generally concluded that ratemaking is  legislative rather than
  quasi-judicial in character.  See Ratepayers Coalition of Rochester v. 
  Rochester Elec. Light and Power Co., 153 Vt. 327, 332, 571 A.2d 606, 609
  (1989).  "Because a  ratemaking agency must be free to reassess the
  reasonableness of rates, it would be illogical, and  inconsistent with the
  agency's function, to give preclusive effect to a prior ratemaking
  determination, 

 <Page 26>

  and courts have refused to do so."  Allied Chemical, 528 N.E.2d at 156
  (emphasis added); see also  Energy Gulf States, Inc. v. Louisiana Pub.
  Serv. Comm'n, 730 So.2d 890, 925 (La. 1999) (rate orders  not generally
  given res judicata effect).  Although some courts have held that res
  judicata applies to  rate cases, a close examination of the cases shows
  that the courts were applying issue preclusion and  not claim preclusion. 
  See, e.g., Allied Chemical, 528 N.E.2d at 156-57; Coalition of Cities, 798 
  S.W.2d at 565; Philadelphia Elec. Co. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n,
  433 A.2d 620, 625-26  (Pa. Commw. 1981).  We have found no case in which
  res judicata - claim preclusion - is applied in  a rate proceeding to
  preclude litigation of claims, or issues, that were not previously
  litigated and  decided.

       The Board analyzed the application of claim preclusion only briefly
  because it accepted the  Department's argument that rate-making is
  legislative, and therefore, the doctrine of claim preclusion  does not
  apply.  Nonetheless, its analysis of collateral estoppel suggests practical
  reasons why it  would be inappropriate to apply claim preclusion to a
  rate-case determination.

    A regulated utility's rates contain thousands of cost items.  It
    would  be an overly burdensome task for litigants and the Board to
    be  required to make an affirmative determination about every
    possible  relevant variable which might have an impact upon the
    cost of  service, particularly within the seven months prescribed
    by 30 V.S.A.  s 227(a).  Therefore, to reasonably manage the
    ratemaking process,  we rely upon the use of evidentiary
    presumptions to facilitate  reaching a conclusion about the
    overall justness and reasonableness  of rates without requiring an
    exhaustive review of hundreds or  thousands of detailed cost of
    service items in every rate case;  according to Board practice, in
    each rate case, a utility's filing  receives the benefit of a
    rebuttable presumption that "expenditures  claimed to support the
    rates were reasonable and prudent." Rate  proceedings then focus
    on those aspects of a filing that parties choose  to examine and
    present to the Board.  Unless a party brings forth  evidence
    challenging the reasonableness of a particular cost item,  these
    working presumptions operate to allow the inclusion of those 
    costs in rates, without requiring the Board to resolve the issue
    through  an affirmative judgment on the merits.

  If we apply claim preclusion to rate cases and broadly define claims that
  should have been litigated  during a rate case, we agree with the Board
  that rate cases will become far more complicated as  parties seek to ensure
  that issues are actually litigated, and not subject to claim preclusion by
  default.

 <Page 27>

       Although the precedents and the practical considerations suggest that
  we should not apply  claim preclusion to  rate-case determinations, we need
  not go that far at this time.  In this case, CVPS  is seeking to have a
  decision that set the rates for an earlier period preclude claims involved
  in this   case that will set rates for a later period.  Under our statutory
  scheme, the Board is authorized to  investigate and change existing rates,
  and the utilities are authorized to seek rate changes.  See 30  V.S.A. §
  218(a) (board may change unreasonable or unjust rate); 30 V.S.A.  § 227(b)
  (board may  order investigation of justness and reasonableness of rates);
  30 V.S.A. § 225(a) (company may file  for change in rate by giving
  forty-five days notice). We do not believe that the statutory scheme 
  contemplates that the Board is bound in a rate case by claims that parties,
  or the Board, could have  litigated in prior rate cases, although they
  chose not to do so.  Thus, we hold that the claims in the  later rate case
  are not identical to those in the earlier rate case simply because the
  cases involve  different periods for which the rates will be in effect. 
  See Dann, 167 Vt. at 125, 702 A.2d at 109  (determination that criminal
  statute prohibiting sale of fireworks is unconstitutional in one criminal 
  case does not bar prosecution, and new adjudication of constitutionality,
  for a different act of selling  fireworks; "[e]ach event is separate . . .
  and gives rise to separate liability"); American Trucking  Ass'ns v.
  Conway, 152 Vt. 363, 371, 566 A.2d 1323, 1328 (1989) (res judicata does not
  apply  where  evidence in the two cases is "sufficiently different" such
  that the claims are not "identical for claim  preclusion purposes); Hill v.
  Grandey, 132 Vt. 460, 463, 321 A.2d 28, 31 (1974) (for res judicata 
  purposes claims are same if same evidence will support action in both
  instances).  Because a required  element of claim preclusion is missing,
  the doctrine does not apply to preclude raising any claims in  this case.

                           IV. Equitable Estoppel

       Finally, CVPS argues that the Board is precluded, under the doctrine
  of equitable estoppel,  from considering the prudency and usefulness
  issues.  As CVPS concedes, it must prove four  elements to establish
  equitable estoppel:

    (1)	the party to be estopped must know the facts; (2) the party
    being  estopped must intend his conduct shall be acted upon or the
    acts  must 

 <Page 28>

    be such that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to
    believe it  is so intended; (3) the party asserting estoppel must
    be ignorant of  the true facts; and (4) the party asserting
    estoppel must rely on the  conduct of the party to be estopped to
    his detriment.

  Wesco, Inc. v. City of Montpelier, 169 Vt. 520, 524, 739 A.2d 1241, 1244-45
  (1999).  Moreover, the  application of "estoppel against the government is
  rare; it is appropriate only when the injustice that  would ensue from a
  failure to find an estoppel sufficiently outweighs any effect upon public
  interest  or policy that would result from estopping the government in a
  particular case."  Agency of Natural  Res. v. Godnick, 162 Vt. 588, 593,
  652 A.2d 988, 991 (1994).

       CVPS's argument on each of the elements is as follows:

         (1) Although it never stated so, the Board intended to
    revisit the prudency of  CVPS's actions with respect to the
    signing of the HQ contract and the premature  lock-in, and the
    usefulness of the HQ power, facts known only to the Board;

         (2) the Board intended that CVPS act on the Board's
    non-disclosure of its  future intentions by failing to appeal the
    1994 rate case decision, and CVPS had a  right to believe no
    future adverse action would be taken;

         (3) CVPS was ignorant of the fact that the Board intended to
    revisit its  decision on prudency and usefulness; and

         (4) CVPS relied upon the limits of the Board's 1994 decision
    by not appealing  it.

  We note that following CVPS's logic, the estoppel would operate against the
  Board and not the  Department.

       We conclude that CVPS has not demonstrated that it meets any of the
  four elements of  equitable estoppel.  In effect, it would use equitable
  estoppel to create a new preclusion doctrine  similar in effect to res
  judicata, at least where it did not appeal from the earlier decision.  We
  do not  believe that the possibility that the Board would visit or revisit
  issues or penalties in future rate cases  is a "fact" for purposes of
  equitable estoppel, nor that a utility can rely on its own opinion of the 
  preclusive effect of a rate case decision, however erroneous that opinion
  may be.  Indeed, we see no 

 <Page 29>

  reason to try to mold equitable estoppel into a preclusion doctrine
  applicable to the contested case  adjudication by the Board.  See American
  Trucking Ass'n, 152 Vt. at 370, 566 A.2d at 1328 (claim  preclusion is a
  "theory of estoppel").  CVPS's reliance and finality interests are
  adequately protected  by issue and claim preclusion, as we have explained
  the application of these doctrines in this case.

       In summary, we hold that, based on issue preclusion arising from the
  1994 rate case, the  Board is precluded from considering whether CVPS was
  prudent in connection with its decision to  lock into the HQ contract. 
  This decision does not preclude the Department from litigating whether 
  CVPS was prudent in negotiating and entering into the HQ contract and does
  not determine what  sanctions the Board may impose in this rate case based
  on its 1994 imprudency decision.  We  remand for further consideration on
  whether the Board is precluded from considering in this rate case  whether
  the HQ power is non-useful because it is uneconomical.  We reject CVPS's
  arguments that  the Board is further precluded from considering claims or
  issues based on claim preclusion (res  judicata) or equitable estoppel.

       Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
  decision.




                                       FOR THE COURT:


                                       _______________________________________
                                       Associate Justice

                                  Footnotes


FN1.  At various points, CVPS has argued that it is the Public Service Board
  that is estopped  from determining whether CVPS was prudent concerning the
  HQ contract or whether the HQ power  is used and useful.  At other points,
  it has argued that the Department is estopped. Certainly, the  concept of
  party can vary in an administrative proceeding, like those before the
  Board, in which the  adjudicatory authority can also raise and shape
  issues.  Indeed, the issues in the 1994 rate case were  initially defined
  by the Board, and the Board initially specified the evidence it wanted
  presented by  the parties.  Moreover, its evaluation of the evidence went
  well beyond the presentation of the  Department.  In view of our analysis,
  we do not believe we have to reach whether it is the Board or  the
  Department, or both, that is estopped.  Solely for convenience, we refer to
  the estopped party as  the Board.

       We also note that there are other parties in this proceeding, but they
  have not participated in  this appeal.  CVPS has argued that they are bound
  by any preclusion decision that binds the  Department.  Because the other
  parties have not participated in this appeal, we accept CVPS's  position.

FN2.  Although the Board acknowledged that collateral estoppel applies, it
  cited an unpublished  decision of this Court, In re Tariff Filing of
  Franklin Elec. Light Co., No. 88-182 (Vt. March  21,1989), for the
  proposition that "the Vermont Supreme Court has ruled that utility
  proceedings can - and sometimes must - allow reconsideration of issues
  considered by the Board in prior cases."  The  decision in Franklin Elec.
  Light Co. reads in its entirety: "The Board's findings do not support its 
  order denying the Company's request for a one percent penalty on overdue
  electric bills."  It was an  unpublished decision, issued after a brief
  argument before five Justices, pursuant to the summary  procedures used for
  a short time before the Court adopted V.R.A.P. 33.1 allowing such cases to
  be  heard by three justices.  Even if the decision directly addressed the
  point raised by the Board, which  it does not, it is of limited
  precedential value.

FN3.  Our conclusion on this element is no different if we say that the
  Board is the party which is  estopped.  In determining the issues, and
  addressing the issues it finds in the evidence, the Board  functions as a
  party.

FN4.  Of course, other proceedings might have preclusive effect as to these
  theories.  In fact,  CVPS argued that the § 248 certificate-of-public-good
  proceeding in which the Board had to approve  the contract, as affirmed by
  this Court in HQ I, had preclusive effect as to theories involving 
  prudency in negotiating and presenting the contract to the Board.  The
  Board rejected that argument,  and CVPS has not appealed that decision.

       Because In re Green Mtn. Power Corp., No. 98-296 was consolidated with
  this case for  argument, we know that the Board could not conclude in that
  proceeding that Green Mountain Power  was imprudent in negotiating the HQ
  contract and seeking its approval.  That conclusion may have  preclusive
  effect against the Department, which apparently used the same arguments and
  evidence on  prudency in that proceeding.

FN5.  In its 1998 decision, the Board noted that it relies upon a rebuttable
  presumption that  expenditures claimed to support the rates are reasonable
  and prudent unless a particular expense item  is actually litigated.  In
  this case, we believe that the prudency of the lock-in was actually
  litigated so  that the presumption does not control.

FN6.  The Board noted that the rate case "has been the most lengthy and
  contentious electric case  in Vermont since the nuclear-era cases of the
  1980's," but added that "[u]nfortunately, the advocacy  has at times seemed
  to focus inordinate attention on relatively minor aspects of the costs of
  service,  thus diverting attention from far more important elements of
  CVPS's costs."

FN7.  In its 1998 decision, the Board found that the Department presented
  testimony "in the  context of an investigation into the Company's resource
  portfolio management practices, not  specifically the prudence of the
  contract itself" and went on to say that the "distinction is more than 
  semantic" because a finding that the lock-in "was imprudent would have
  affected CVPS's ability to  recover costs associated with the Contract for
  its remaining life."  We find the Board's current  characterization of what
  was in issue in 1994 to be inconsistent with its definition of the issues
  at  that time.  The Board sought to litigate the prudency of the lock-in in
  1994 and directed the parties to  submit evidence to do so.  

FN8.  Again we disagree with the Board's characterization of the 1994 issues
  and the Board's  actions in its 1998 preclusion decision.  In the 1998
  decision, the Board stated that the Department  did not litigate in 1994
  whether the HQ power was used and useful as "that ratemaking principle had 
  been consistently applied by the Board over a prolonged period," but
  instead litigated a "new  'economic used-and-useful' test and urged that
  the Board modify its traditional method of evaluating 
  used-and-usefulness."  As we state in the text, we do not believe that this
  is a fair characterization of  what occurred in 1994.  Moreover, we have
  difficulty accepting that the Board would have rejected  the Department's
  position because it was labeled "new" when it would have accepted the exact
  same  theory if it had been labeled "traditional."
