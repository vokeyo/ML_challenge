Reply-to: wehmann@fnal.gov

Hi George,

   Is the 466 card that used to drive the E:H104 magnet doing
anything?  Or is it being held in reserve?  Isn't that magnet now
driven by E:HT104 and a 453 card?  The database entries and parameter
page lines (e.g. E38 bnds) for E:H104 and its "family" still exist.  I
do see that E:HT104 has appeared on the trim list on E38 trms.

Cheers,
Alan

The 466 card is NOT used and can be removed at some appropiate 
time.  E:HT104 has NEW data base entries and uses a spare channel 
of an existing 453 in the corrector rack.  I have added the E:HT104 
parameters to the existing E38 pages.

Marv,  (per our recent telecon)

The 200 turn dipole in the NuMI Beamline in the Main Injector has been 
reconfigured to be controlled from Leon Bartelson's trim element power 
supply.

An associated change relates to the loss monitor in that region. 
E:LMH104 needs to be renamed as E:LMHT04.  Description should read "Loss 
Monitor #7 at HT104".  Please make necessary database changes.  I will 
get new cable labels to you soon.

Thanks,  Dukes

Since you made the original data base entry, do you want the honors of 
making this change?

The recent change of H104 to HT104 with the power supply now being a 
trim element regulator instead of a 20 kW PEI is reflected in the 
attached document.  The loss monitor for that location is also being 
changed.

The C466 module that used to control the device will remain with its 
cabling and associated database entries per Steve Hays' request.  It may 
come in handy if one of the other PEIs breaks.  The Beam Permit System 
will no longer look at H104 parameters.

I suggest the E38 parameter page(s) be looked at to come into alignment 
with this new reality.  Give me a call if any questions.  Alan - please 
post this version of CR on the WEB for all to see.

Any questions - give me a call at 4040.

Hi George,

   Is the 466 card that used to drive the E:H104 magnet doing
anything?  Or is it being held in reserve?  Isn't that magnet now
driven by E:HT104 and a 453 card?  The database entries and parameter
page lines (e.g. E38 bnds) for E:H104 and its "family" still exist.  I
do see that E:HT104 has appeared on the trim list on E38 trms.

Cheers,
Alan

The 466 card is NOT used and can be removed at some appropiate 
time.  E:HT104 has NEW data base entries and uses a spare channel 
of an existing 453 in the corrector rack.  I have added the E:HT104 
parameters to the existing E38 pages.

Hi,    One question. Are we sure of the polarity?  <PL>

Marv,  (per our recent telecon)

The 200 turn dipole in the NuMI Beamline in the Main Injector has been 
reconfigured to be controlled from Leon Bartelson's trim element power 
supply.

An associated change relates to the loss monitor in that region. 
E:LMH104 needs to be renamed as E:LMHT04.  Description should read "Loss 
Monitor #7 at HT104".  Please make necessary database changes.  I will 
get new cable labels to you soon.

Thanks,  Dukes

Since you made the original data base entry, do you want the honors of 
making this change?

The recent change of H104 to HT104 with the power supply now being a 
trim element regulator instead of a 20 kW PEI is reflected in the 
attached document.  The loss monitor for that location is also being 
changed.

The C466 module that used to control the device will remain with its 
cabling and associated database entries per Steve Hays' request.  It may 
come in handy if one of the other PEIs breaks.  The Beam Permit System 
will no longer look at H104 parameters.

I suggest the E38 parameter page(s) be looked at to come into alignment 
with this new reality.  Give me a call if any questions.  Alan - please 
post this version of CR on the WEB for all to see.

Any questions - give me a call at 4040.
