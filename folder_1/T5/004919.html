						<TD WIDTH=492 COLSPAN=8><P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">To contemplate war is to think about the most horrible of human experiences.&nbsp; On this February day, as this nation stands at the brink of battle, 
							every American on some level must be contemplating the horrors of war.</FONT><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Yet, this Chamber is, for the most part, silent -- ominously, dreadfully silent.&nbsp; There is no 
							debate, no discussion, no attempt to lay out for the nation the pros and cons of this particular war.&nbsp; There is nothing.<P ALIGN=LEFT>We stand passively mute in the United States Senate, paralyzed by our own uncertainty, seemingly 
							stunned by the sheer turmoil of events.&nbsp; Only on the editorial pages of our newspapers is there much substantive discussion of the prudence or imprudence of engaging in this particular war.<P ALIGN=LEFT>And this is no small 
							conflagration we contemplate.&nbsp; This is no simple attempt to defang a villain.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; This coming battle, if it materializes, represents a turning point in U.S. foreign policy and possibly a turning point in the recent history 
							of the world.<P ALIGN=LEFT>This nation is about to embark upon the first test of a revolutionary doctrine applied in an extraordinary way at an unfortunate time.&nbsp; The doctrine of preemption -- the idea that the United States or any 
							other nation can legitimately attack a nation that is not imminently threatening but may be threatening in the future -- is a radical new twist on the traditional idea of self defense.&nbsp; It appears to be in contravention of 
							international law and the UN Charter.&nbsp; And it is being tested at a time of world-wide terrorism, making many countries around the globe wonder if they will soon be on our -- or some other nation's -- hit list.&nbsp; High level 
							Administration figures recently refused to take nuclear weapons off of the table when discussing a possible attack against Iraq. What could be more destabilizing and unwise than this type of uncertainty, particularly in a world where 
							globalism has tied the vital economic and security interests of many nations so closely together?&nbsp; There are huge cracks emerging in our time-honored alliances, and U.S. intentions are suddenly subject to damaging worldwide 
							speculation.&nbsp; Anti-Americanism based on mistrust, misinformation, suspicion, and alarming rhetoric from U.S. leaders is fracturing the once solid alliance against global terrorism which existed after September 11.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Here at 
							home, people are warned of imminent terrorist attacks with little guidance as to when or where such attacks might occur.&nbsp; Family members are being called to active military duty, with no idea of the duration of their stay or what 
							horrors they may face.&nbsp; Communities are being left with less than adequate police and fire protection.&nbsp; Other essential services are also short-staffed.&nbsp; The mood of the nation is grim.&nbsp; The economy is stumbling.&nbsp; 
							Fuel prices are rising and may soon spike higher.<P ALIGN=LEFT>This Administration, now in power for a little over two years, must be judged on its record.&nbsp; I believe that that record is dismal.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In that scant two years, 
							this Administration has squandered a large projected surplus of some $5.6 trillion over the next decade and taken us to projected deficits as far as the eye can see.&nbsp; This Administration's domestic policy has put many of our states in 
							dire financial condition, under funding scores of essential programs for our people.&nbsp; This Administration has fostered policies which have slowed economic growth.&nbsp; This Administration has ignored urgent matters such as the crisis 
							in health care for our elderly.&nbsp; This Administration has been slow to provide adequate funding for homeland security.&nbsp; This Administration has been reluctant to better protect our long and porous borders.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In foreign 
							policy, this Administration has failed to find Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; In fact, just yesterday we heard from him again marshaling his forces and urging them to kill.&nbsp; This Administration has split traditional alliances, possibly 
							crippling, for all time, International order-keeping entities like the United Nations and NATO.&nbsp; This Administration has called into question the traditional worldwide perception of the United States as well-intentioned, 
							peacekeeper.&nbsp; This Administration has turned the patient art of diplomacy into threats, labeling, and name calling of the sort that reflects quite poorly on the intelligence and sensitivity of our leaders, and which will have 
							consequences for years to come.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Calling heads of state pygmies, labeling whole countries as evil, denigrating powerful European allies as irrelevant -- these types of crude insensitivities can do our great nation no good.&nbsp; 
							We may have massive military might, but we cannot fight a global war on terrorism alone.&nbsp; We need the cooperation and friendship of our time-honored allies as well as the newer found friends whom we can attract with our wealth.&nbsp; 
							Our awesome military machine will do us little good if we suffer another devastating attack on our homeland which severely damages our economy.&nbsp; Our military manpower is already stretched thin and we will need the augmenting support of 
							those nations who can supply troop strength, not just sign letters cheering us on.<P ALIGN=LEFT>The war in Afghanistan has cost us $37 billion so far, yet there is evidence that terrorism may already be starting to regain its hold in that 
							region.&nbsp; We have not found bin Laden, and unless we secure the peace in Afghanistan, the dark dens of terrorism may yet again flourish in that remote and devastated land.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Pakistan as well is at risk of destabilizing 
							forces.&nbsp; This Administration has not finished the first war against terrorism and yet it is eager to embark on another conflict with perils much greater than those in Afghanistan.&nbsp; Is our attention span that short?&nbsp; Have we 
							not learned that after winning the war one must always secure the peace?<P ALIGN=LEFT>And yet we hear little about the aftermath of war in Iraq.&nbsp; In the absence of plans, speculation abroad is rife.&nbsp; Will we seize Iraq's oil 
							fields, becoming an occupying power which controls the price and supply of that nation's oil for the foreseeable future?&nbsp; To whom do we propose to hand the reins of power after Saddam Hussein?<P ALIGN=LEFT>Will our war inflame the 
							Muslim world resulting in devastating attacks on Israel?&nbsp; Will Israel retaliate with its own nuclear arsenal?&nbsp; Will the Jordanian and Saudi Arabian governments be toppled by radicals, bolstered by Iran which has much closer ties 
							to terrorism than Iraq?<P ALIGN=LEFT>Could a disruption of the world's oil supply lead to a world-wide recession?&nbsp; Has our senselessly bellicose language and our callous disregard of the interests and opinions of other nations 
							increased the global race to join the nuclear club and made proliferation an even more lucrative practice for nations which need the income?<P ALIGN=LEFT>In only the space of two short years this reckless and arrogant Administration has 
							initiated policies which may reap disastrous consequences for years.<P ALIGN=LEFT>One can understand the anger and shock of any President after the savage attacks of September 11.&nbsp; One can appreciate the frustration of having only a 
							shadow to chase and an amorphous, fleeting enemy on which it is nearly impossible to exact retribution.<P ALIGN=LEFT>But to turn one's frustration and anger into the kind of extremely destabilizing and dangerous foreign policy debacle that 
							the world is currently witnessing is inexcusable from any Administration charged with the awesome power and responsibility of guiding the destiny of the greatest superpower on the planet.&nbsp; Frankly many of the pronouncements made by 
							this Administration are outrageous.&nbsp; There is no other word.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Yet this chamber is hauntingly silent.&nbsp; On what is possibly the eve of horrific infliction of death and destruction on the population of the nation of Iraq 
							-- a population, I might add, of which over 50% is under age 15 -- this chamber is silent.&nbsp; On what is possibly only days before we send thousands of our own citizens to face unimagined horrors of chemical and biological warfare -- 
							this chamber is silent.&nbsp; On the eve of what could possibly be a vicious terrorist attack in retaliation for our attack on Iraq, it is business as usual in the United States Senate.<P ALIGN=LEFT>We are truly &quot;sleepwalking through 
							history.&quot;&nbsp; In my heart of hearts I pray that this great nation and its good and trusting citizens are not in for a rudest of awakenings.<P ALIGN=LEFT>To engage in war is always to pick a wild card.&nbsp; And war must always be a 
							last resort, not a first choice.&nbsp; I truly must question the judgment of any President who can say that a massive unprovoked military attack on a nation which is over 50% children is &quot;in the highest moral traditions of our 
							country&quot;.&nbsp; This war is not necessary at this time.&nbsp; Pressure appears to be having a good result in Iraq.&nbsp; Our mistake was to put ourselves in a corner so quickly.&nbsp; Our challenge is to now find a graceful way out of 
							a box of our own making.&nbsp; Perhaps there is still a way if we allow more time.<P ALIGN=CENTER>###</FONT></TD>
