   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(b) In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by subsection (a) of this section, a trustee shall

   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(c) A trustee may not make an adjustment:</p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(1) That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse
      and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be or has been allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee
      did not have the power to make the adjustment;

      aside;
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(5) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes an individual to be treated as the owner of all or
      part of the trust for income-tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess
      the power to make an adjustment;
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(6) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust assets to be included for
      estate-tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and
      the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(7) If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust; or</p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(8) If the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly.</p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(d) If paragraph (c)(5), (6), (7), or (8) of this section applies to a trustee and there is more than 1 trustee, a cotrustee
      to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or
      trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust.
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(e) A trustee may release the entire power conferred by subsection (a) of this section or may release only the power to adjust
      from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether the possession
      or exercise of the power will cause a result described in paragraph (c)(1) through (6) or (c)(8) of this section or if the
      trustee determines that the possession or exercise of the power might deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden
      not described in subsection (c) of this section. The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period
      measured by the life of an individual.
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(f) Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the
      application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee
      the power of adjustment conferred by subsection (a) of this section.

   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(2) After calculating the trust's capital gain net income described in &sect; 1222(9) [26 U.S.C. &sect; 1222(9)] of the Internal Revenue

      of the Internal Revenue Code, and then from net long-term capital gain described in &sect; 1222(7) [26 U.S.C. &sect; 1222(7)] of the

   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(a) In any proceeding involving a trustee's decision to exercise or refrain from the exercise of a discretionary power conferred
      upon the trustee by this chapter, the trustee's decision shall be changed by the court only if the court determines that the
      trustee's decision was an abuse of the trustee's discretion. A trustee's decision is not an abuse of discretion merely because
      the court would have exercised the power in a different manner or would not have exercised the power.
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(b) The decisions to which subsection (a) of this section applies include:</p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(1) A decision under &sect; 6113 of this title as to whether and to what extent an amount should be transferred from principal
      to income or from income to principal.
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(2) A decision regarding the factors that are relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, the extent to which the factors
      are relevant, and the weight, if any, to be given to those factors, in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the
      discretionary power conferred by &sect; 6113 of this title.
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(c) If the court determines that a trustee has abused the trustee's discretion, the court may place the income and remainder
      beneficiaries in the positions they would have occupied if the discretion had not been abused, according to the following
      rules:
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(1) To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in no distribution to a beneficiary or in a distribution that
      is too small, the court shall order the trustee to distribute from the trust to the beneficiary an amount that the court determines
      will restore the beneficiary in whole or in part, to the beneficiary's appropriate position.
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(2) To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary which is too large, the court
      shall place the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in whole or in part, in their appropriate positions by ordering the trustee
      to withhold an amount from 1 or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large
      or ordering that beneficiary to return some or all of the distribution to the trust.
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 43pt">(3) To the extent that the court is unable, after applying paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, to place the beneficiaries,
      the trust, or both, in the positions they would have occupied if the discretion had not been abused, the court may order the
      trustee to pay an appropriate amount from its own funds to 1 or more beneficiaries or the trust or both.
   </p>
   <p class="section-para" style="text-indent: 14pt">(d) In a proceeding brought by a trustee under this section, the Court of Chancery is to determine in accordance with the
      provisions of this section whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise by the trustee of a discretionary power conferred by
      this chapter would result in an abuse of the trustee's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise
      of the power and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reason for the proposal, the facts upon
      which the trustee relies, and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries will be affected by the proposed
      exercise or nonexercise of the power, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of
      establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.
