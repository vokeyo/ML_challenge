 3  for base-load generating capacity, and the need for adequate
 4  electricity at a reasonable cost.
 5         (a)  The applicant's petition shall include:
 6         1.  A description of the need for the generation
 7  capacity.
 8         2.  A description of how the proposed nuclear <U>or</U>
 9  <U>advanced technology coal</U> power plant will enhance the
10  reliability of electric power production within the state by
11  improving the balance of power plant fuel diversity and
12  reducing Florida's dependence on fuel oil and natural gas.
13         3.  A description of and a nonbinding estimate of the
14  cost of the nuclear <U>or advanced technology coal</U> power plant.
15         4.  The annualized base revenue requirement for the

19  with any electric utilities regarding ownership of a portion

26         1.  Provide needed base-load capacity.
27         2.  Enhance the reliability of electric power

10  power supply prior to making application under this act or
11  receiving a determination of need from the commission.
12         (d)  The commission's determination of need for a
13  nuclear <U>or advanced technology coal</U> power plant shall create a
14  presumption of public need and necessity and shall serve as
15  the commission's report required by s. 403.507(4)(a). An order
16  entered pursuant to this section constitutes final agency
17  action. Any petition for reconsideration of a final order on a
18  petition for need determination shall be filed within 5 days
19  after the date of such order. The commission's final order,
20  including any order on reconsideration, shall be reviewable on
21  appeal in the Florida Supreme Court. Inasmuch as delay in the
22  determination of need will delay siting of a nuclear <U>or</U>
23  <U>advanced technology coal</U> power plant or diminish the
24  opportunity for savings to customers under the federal Energy
25  Policy Act of 2005, the Supreme Court shall proceed to hear
26  and determine the action as expeditiously as practicable and
