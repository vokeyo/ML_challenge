<h1>The Agricultural and Labor Program, Inc., DAB No. 460 (1983) </h1>
<p>GAB Decision 460<br>
  Docket No. 83-60 </p>
<p>August 31, 1983 </p>
<p>The Agricultural and Labor Program, Inc.; <br>
  Garrett, Donald; Teitz, Alexander Settle, Norvel</p>
<p><br>
  The Agricultural and Labor Program, Inc. (ALPI), of Winter Haven,<br>
  Florida, appealed a decision of the Office of Human Development Services<br>
  (OHDS) disallowing a $25,600 cost charged to a Head Start grant for<br>
  ALPI's budget year starting March 1, 1981.</p>
<p> ALPI paid $25,600 for a modular classroom, but the purchase became<br>
  beset with controversy; the manufacturer did not deliver the classroom<br>
  and the matter is still in litigation.</p>
<p> OHDS considered the payment premature and disallowed the $25,600 on<br>
  the basis of cost principles that can be read as proscribing imprudent<br>
  or nonbeneficial costs. Letter from OHDS to ALPI dated March 2, 1983;<br>
  Transcript of telephone conference, May 5, 1983 (Transcript), pp. 3-5;<br>
  Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-122 (OMB Circular A-122),<br>
  Attachment A, section A.2.a, A.3. See, also, Response of the Secretary<br>
  of Health and Human Services (OHDS brief), pp. 2-4; OMB Circular A-122,<br>
  Attachment A, section A.4.a. ALPI conceded that the payment involved a<br>
  lack of good judgment and did not contest the applicability of the cost<br>
  principles as basis for disallowance. Statement of Appeal (ALPI brief),<br>
  p. 4. The parties' disagreement in this appeal was about the<br>
  consequences of the $25,600 disallowance determination.</p>
<p> OHDS, envisioning that if the classroom is ever delivered it may be<br>
  too late to be of use, took the position that it would be for OHDS to<br>
  decide if it should pay the $25,600 to ALPI if the classroom was ever<br>
  delivered. OHDS brief, p. 4, n. 2. OHDS' position was tantamount to<br>
  saying that the present disallowance was and should be the final<br>
  disposition as far as ALPI's rights under the existing grant are<br>
  concerned.</p>
<p> ALPI, averring continuing need for the classroom, envisioning an<br>
  early and favorable end to ALPI's litigation with the manufacturer, and<br>
  pointing to some arguable involvement or acquiescence of OHDS personnel<br>
  in ALPI's handling of the situation, took the position that the<br>
  disallowance should be postponed pending the outcome of (2) the<br>
  litigation. ALPI brief, p. 4. ALPI said in effect that if the<br>
  classroom is delivered within some reasonable time there should be no<br>
  disallowance.</p>
<p> We agree with OHDS that the present disallowance is correct. The<br>
  $25,600 payment was imprudent in the light of the facts to date. ALPI<br>
  made it on the basis of a sketchy purchase order and ambiguous letters<br>
  from the manufacturer (Tabs 4, 5 and 6 attached to ALPI brief),<br>
  apparently without regard to usual business practice. As noted,<br>
  appellant conceded that its transaction involved a lack of good<br>
  judgment. Moreover, the Head Start grant has not yet benefited, and may<br>
  never benefit, from the expenditure.</p>
<p> Regarding implementation of the disallowance, the OHDS brief states,<br>
  &quot;If the court orders that the vendor specifically perform the contract,<br>
  and the Agricultural and Labor Program, Inc. is still a Head Start<br>
  grantee, and uses the modular unit for grant purposes and if all other<br>
  requirements are met, the Secretary may reissue the grant funds.&quot; Id.,<br>
  p. 4, n. 2. We think this is fair, particularly since one may infer<br>
  from the circumstances in the record that if the classroom had been<br>
  delivered on schedule no one would have disallowed the premature payment<br>
  on the ground of imprudence. We also note, however, that payment might<br>
  be appropriate if the classroom is delivered even without a court order.</p>
<p> The disallowance is affirmed.</p>
