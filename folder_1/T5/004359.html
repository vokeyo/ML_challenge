<B>Overview of Rare Diseases Research Activities</B>
<P>

The mission of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is to conduct and support research on the reproductive, physiologic and behavioral processes that determine the health of individuals and populations.  The Institute's programs are based on the concept that adult health and well-being are determined in part by episodes early in life and that human development continues throughout the life span.  Diseases or conditions that interfere with healthy development are of concern to the Institute and thus, the NICHD supports research in the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of many rare diseases and disorders.

<B>Recent Scientific Advances in Rare Diseases Research</B>
<P>

<A NAME="hypog"></A>
<A NAME="familiar"></A>
<A NAME="nesid"></A>
<B><I>Familiar Hyperinsulinemia</I></B>
<P>

Familiar hyperinsulinemia, also known as nesidioblastosis, is characterized by unregulated insulin secretion in the neonatal period despite the presence of severe, life-threatening, hypoglycemia.  NICHD-supported investigators have currently found two different mutations in the sulfonylurea receptor gene in individuals affected with this disorder.  Mutational analyses will be undertaken on blood samples obtained from 50 affected individuals of various ethnic backgrounds and clinical symptoms.  These studies will enable the investigators to establish the frequency of the gene mutations in a variety of ethnic groups and to correlate clinical status of patients with their genetic make-up. These investigations may help to predict which individuals will respond to medical therapy and which ones will require surgical intervention to resolve their severe hypoglycemia. 
<P>

<A NAME="congenital"></A>
<A NAME="polycystic"></A>
<B><I>3 Beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Deficiency</I></B>
<P>

3 Beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme deficiency (HSD) is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  The clinical spectrum of the disease ranges from the severe form which manifests ambiguous genitalia, salt wasting, and hypogonadism, to the less severe form which demonstrates premature adrenarche, hirsutism or menstrual disorders.  Genes encoding the defective adrenal steroidogenic enzymes are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, indicating that two mutant genes are necessary to produce the disorder.  Carriers of one mutant gene are clinically normal and do not manifest any symptoms.  Investigators will attempt to establish the hormonal criteria for diagnosis of both the severe and mild forms of the disease and determine a genotype/phenotype correlation.  Adrenal 3   HSD enzyme activity and hormonal response will also be measured in the carrier state.  Mild 3   HSD deficiency may be associated with a common clinical disorder in women known as polycystic ovary syndrome.  The association between mildly decreased 3   HSD activity and the insulin resistance of polycystic ovary syndrome will be characterized.  Additionally, studies to determine prenatal diagnostic criteria of the disease will be carried out.

<A NAME="alstrom"></A>
<A NAME="diabetes"></A>
<A NAME="neuro"></A>
<A NAME="obesity"></A>
<B><I>Alstrom Syndrome</I></B>
<P>

Alstrom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes progressive retinal degeneration, hearing loss, obesity, diabetes, and cardiac and renal dysfunction.  Investigations are underway to characterize the genetic defects underlying this disorder.  Understanding the genetic and molecular basis may provide insight into the mechanisms of more common disorders with similar and overlapping manifestations.  Identification of the gene mutation causing Alstrom Syndrome may aid in understanding novel metabolic and regulatory pathways involved in neurosensory disease, obesity and type-2 diabetes.  
<P>

<A NAME="rett1"></A>
<B><I>Rett Syndrome</I></B>
<P>

A search for a marker for Rett syndrome (RS), a fatal disorder affecting brain neurons, is being pursued using chromosomal, biochemical and molecular techniques.  Chromosomal studies are performed on each patient and, should an abnormality be encountered, it is compared to known chromosomal defects so that other disorders may be excluded.  The reason for these studies is to determine if there are any disorders that may mimic the characteristics of Rett syndrome.  The RS gene has been mapped to a region on the long arm of the X chromosome.  A search for the candidate gene by molecular techniques is actively being followed.  Biochemical studies have eliminated amino acid or organic acid abnormalities as a cause of RS.  
<P>

Since Rett syndrome is a neurological condition, investigators have devised an innovative approach to study deficits of neurogenesis.  Olfactory neurons from nasal biopsies are being utilized to define abnormalities in neuronal development.  Preliminary results have shown that maintenance or development of the olfactory receptor neurons are defective in RS.  Using specific markers for nasal neuron development, the ability of the cells to mature and regenerate is being analyzed.  Understanding the dynamics of the abnormality will provide insights into the signaling programs of neurogenesis and neuronal regeneration.  
<P>

<A NAME="turner"></A>
<B><I>Turner Syndrome</I></B> 
<P>

Turner syndrome is due to the complete or partial absence of one of the two X chromosomes in females, resulting in short stature, reproductive abnormalities, and other anomalies.  Studies of a group of girls with Turner syndrome yielded new findings concerning behavior and social relationships.  Analyses have revealed weaker social relationships, school performance, and self-esteem compared to control girls matched for age, socioeconomic status, and verbal IQ.  When girls with Turner syndrome were administered estrogen beginning at age 12, they demonstrated improved self-concept, both by self and parental report, so that by age 14-15, they resembled the normal controls.  This improvement was not seen in a comparison group of Turner girls in whom estrogen treatment was delayed.  These findings underscore the need to initiate estrogen replacement therapy by age 12-14 years in this population.  Second, cognitive studies of the Turner subjects have shown a characteristic profile of impaired performance on tests of spatial recall, recognition, and reasoning despite normal verbal ability and performance.  This cognitive profile was consistent from childhood through adolescence.   The cognitive findings suggest that spatial abilities depend on X-chromosome genes.   Ongoing studies are attempting to localize these genes by determining the relationship between genotype and cognitive phenotype in girls with partial chromosome deletions.   From a social and educational standpoint, these studies suggest subtle differences in the social and cognitive performance of girls with Turner syndrome that may respond to educational approaches that are closely tailored to their particular needs.

<A NAME="carney"></A>
<A NAME="cushings"></A>
<A NAME="multiple"></A>
<A NAME="primary"></A>
<B><I>Carney Syndrome</I></B>
<P>

NICHD intramural investigators have documented the paradoxical control of adrenal activity in the multiple endocrine tumor syndrome known as Carney Complex.  This syndrome is associated with an adrenal pathology known as primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD), which may result in Cushing's syndrome.  Investigators showed that treatment with dexamethasone produces a paradoxical increase in adrenal cortisol output in PPNAD patients, in contrast to normal individuals who show suppression and to patients with typical adrenal tumors, who have a flat response.  This novel finding suggests a fundamental abnormality in adrenal cortical cell biology in PPNAD, furnishes a unique insight into the pathophysiology of the Carney syndrome  and provides a potential new diagnostic strategy.

<A NAME="ehlers"></A>
<B><I>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome</I></B>
<P>

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder with symptoms of increased articular mobility and dermal elasticity, as well as tissue fragility.  In four cases of type IV EDS studied, all demonstrated electrophoretic abnormalities of type III collagen.  In three cases, there was a reduction in the quantity of type III collagen.  Various patients with EDS were screened for defects in the alpha chains of type V collagen, one of the minor collagens associated with type I collagen.  In one patient, a splicing defect was demonstrated in the DNA resulting in retention of 100 base pairs from the adjacent intron.  This intronic insertion is out of frame and leads to a premature termination codon.  This is the first insertion mutation detected in type V collagen.
<P>

<A NAME="osteogenesis"></A>
<B><I>Osteogenesis Imperfecta</I></B>
<P>

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a disorder characterized by abnormal fragile bones.   Several forms have been described.  The newborn type is most severe.  Infants are born with multiple fractures which lead to shortening of the extremities.  A clinical protocol for growth hormone treatment of OI patients has been completed.  Twenty-six children with types III and IV OI were treated for a term of at least one year.  Fourteen of the 26 children demonstrated a positive response to treatment, as defined by a sustained increase in linear growth rate of at least 50 percent over baseline rate.  The responder group consisted predominantly of children with type IV OI.  An enzyme called bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was significantly increased over baseline after one year of treatment.  Bone morphology of responders showed a significant increase in bone volume/total volume, mineralized bone volume/total volume and bone formation rate/total volume.  It appears that there is a significant population of OI children, especially those with type IV, who respond to growth hormone treatment with increased growth rates and positive changes in bone formation.  A new growth hormone trial has been initiated in which responders will be treated until they reach final adult stature to determine the long term effect on growth and bone quality.

<A NAME="hermansky"></A>
<A NAME="oculo"></A>
<B><I>Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome</I></B>
<P>

Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal recessive disorder consisting of oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding predisposition and lysosomal storage of ceroid lipofuscin.  HPS has an incidence of 1 in 1800 in northwest Puerto Rico, but occurs throughout the world.  An HPS gene on chromosome 10 has been cloned, sequenced, and characterized, but the function of its protein product is unknown.  Studies were carried out on 74 patients, including 25 non-Puerto Ricans.  Clinical differences were demonstrated between patients homozygous for a 16-base pair duplication in the HPS-1  gene and patients lacking the duplication.  In particular, the duplication patients were at significantly increased risk for developing the pulmonary fibrosis of HPS.  Because of this fatal complication, the NICHD, in collaboration with the NHLBI, have initiated a double blind, placebo-controlled therapeutic trial of the antifibrotic agent, pirfenidone, to combat the progression of pulmonary fibrosis.  Molecular studies were conducted on all non-duplication patients to detect other HPS-1 mutations.  Mutations were identified in four patients.  All the newly described mutations were associated with decreased or undetectable levels of HPS-1.  In 15 HPS patients, no HPS-1 mutation was discovered.   These individuals support the concept that more than one gene is responsible for this disease.

<A NAME="idiopathic"></A>
<B><I>Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism</I></B>
<P>

Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) causes delayed puberty of unknown etiology in both males and females.  The diagnosis of IHH is strictly defined on the basis of historical information, physical findings and endocrinologic studies.  Investigations are in progress to further characterize the clinical picture of IHH patients and evaluate pedigrees for potential modes of inheritance.  Male and female patients are subclassified as having complete or partial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and associated abnormalities are identified.  Molecular genetic studies are also being completed.  At this point, two unrelated individuals have been identified with mutations of the receptor for gonadotrophic releasing hormone.  Both have one copy of a previously known mutation and one copy each of  different mutations.  The mutations alter different parts of the receptor molecule and may have differing effects on its function.

<B>Ongoing, New and Planned Research Initiatives</B>
<P>

A primary goal of the NICHD is to encourage research on the molecular susceptibility and etiology of human birth defects.  On July 20-21, 1998, the second in a series of workshops on structural birth defects was convened.  While the first workshop focused on clinical and epidemiological aspects of structural birth defects, this second workshop highlighted basic developmental and molecular biology, genetics and other fundamental disciplines.  These workshops have formed the basis of the NICHD Birth Defects Initiative.  Two RFAs are planned for publication in FY 1999 for which funding will be available during FY 2000.  One RFA focuses on the genetic susceptibility and mechanisms of human congenital malformations, including research on the contribution of potential genetic and environmental factors, and the etiology, distribution and prevention of disease within families and across populations.  The other proposed RFA is for program projects related to developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of structural anomalies using animal models and translational research studying human structural birth defects.  Ideally, this initiative will create a setting where basic scientists can work closely and synergistically with clinicians.

<A NAME="down"></A>
On November 20-22, 1997, the NICHD co-sponsored with the National Down Syndrome Society the &quot;International Down Syndrome Conference on Cognition and Behavior.&quot;  The conference topics included prelinguistic and early linguistic development; neural development; neural and behavioral indices of attention and cognition in infants; language and reading; behavior management; social, emotional and sexual function; behavioral competence; living in the community; aging and dementia.  This conference led to the publication of an RFA which resulted in funding six research projects addressing language development, perceptual-motor learning and behavior, dementia, working memory and pharmacotherapies using a model for Down syndrome.

<A NAME="rett2"></A>
On April&#160;30 - May&#160;1,&#160;1998, a conference was held on &quot;Dendritic Mechanism in Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities,&quot; which covered pathophysiological abnormalities at the dendritic level in Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, autism and learning disabilities.
<P>

A PA entitled &quot;Vulvodynia: Systematic, Epidemiologic, Etiologic or Therapeutic Studies&quot; was issued to increase research efforts on the prevalence, criteria for accurate diagnosis, underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and therapeutic interventions for vulvodynia, a syndrome of vulvar pain and sexual dysfunction believed to be rare.
