BOREAS Level-3s SPOT Imagery: Scaled At-sensor Radiance in LGSOWG Format

Summary

For BOREAS, the level-3s SPOT data, along with the other remotely sensed images, 
were collected in order to provide spatially extensive information over the 
primary study areas.  This information includes radiant energy, detailed land 
cover, and biophysical parameter maps such as FPAR and LAI.  The SPOT images 
acquired for the BOREAS project were selected primarily to fill temporal gaps in 
the Landsat TM image data collection.  CCRS collected and supplied the level-3s 
images to BORIS for use in the remote sensing research activities. Spatially, 
the level-3s images cover 60-by 60-km portions of the BOREAS NSA and SSA.  
Temporally, the images cover the period of 17-Apr-1994 to 30-Aug-1996.  The 
images are available in binary image format files.

1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS Level-3s SPOT Imagery: Scaled At-sensor Radiance in LGSOWG Format

1.2 Data Set Introduction

The BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Staff Science effort covered 
those activities that were BOREAS community-level activities or required uniform 
data collection procedures across sites and time. These activities included the 
acquisition of the relevant satellite data. Data from the High-Resolution 
Visible (HRV) instruments on the Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 
satellites were acquired by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) and 
provided for use by BOREAS researchers.  BOREAS Information System (BORIS) and 
CCRS personnel subsequently reviewed and inventoried the images described here.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

For BOREAS, the SPOT imagery, along with the other remotely sensed images, was 
collected in order to provide spatially extensive information over the primary 
study areas.   The SPOT images acquired for the BOREAS project were selected 
primarily to fill temporal gaps in the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image 
collection.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

SPOT level-3s data in BORIS contain the following parameters:

Original image header information, image coordinates, gains and offsets for each 
band for at-sensor radiance derivations, image bands 1 to 3 processed with 
systematic spatial corrections.

1.5 Discussion

Use and distribution of the level-3s SPOT images are subject to copyright 
restrictions.  CCRS and Radarsat International (RSI) granted permission to 
BOREAS to place a subset of the level-3a Landsat TM images on the BOREAS CD-ROM 
series. However, none of the other Landsat TM or level-3s SPOT images are 
included.  The level-3s SPOT images may not be available for public access.  
Please see Sections 15 and 16 for further details.

BORIS Staff processed the SPOT level-3s imagery by:
1) Extracting pertinent header information from the level-3s image product and 
placing it in an American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) file 
on disk.
2) Reading the information in the ASCII disk file and loading the online data 
base with pertinent information.

3. Theory of Measurements

The launch of France's SPOT satellite system on 22-Feb-1986 gave the remote 
sensing community the capability of applying high-resolution multispectral 
imagery to a range of land use and land cover analyses. The SPOT satellite 
platforms are equipped with two HRV linear array (pushbroom) sensors capable of 
operating in a panchromatic (PAN) mode with 10-m resolution, or a three-band 
multispectral (XS) mode with 20-m resolution. The SPOT-1 satellite was retired 
from active service on 31-Dec-1990 but was reactivated in Jan-1998. SPOT-2 was 
launched on 22-Jan-1990.  SPOT-3 was launched on 25-Sep-1993 and suffered an 
unrecoverable malfunction on 14-Nov-1997.  SPOT-4 was launched on 24-Mar-1998.  
Currently, SPOT-1, SPOT-2, and SPOT-4 continue to fulfill the SPOT global 
mission. 

Thematic considerations have dictated, within technical constraints, the choice 
of spectral band position and width in the multispectral mode. Three bands were 
selected for the multispectral mode: 1) A green (500- to 590-nm) band centered 
at the 550-nm maximum in the chlorophyll reflectance curve, which is on the long 
wavelength side of the broad attenuation minimum of water, thus giving access to 
turbidity assessment and bathymetric evaluation in the first 10 to 20 m of 
surface water. 2) A red band (610 to 680 nm), similar to the Landsat TM channel 
3, which provides much information on crop identification, bare soil, and rocky 
surfaces. Atmospheric transmittance on a fine day is about 90 percent while 
water penetration is about 2 m with surface reflectance of 4 percent 
(attenuation coefficient: 5x10-1 m-1). This band corresponds to chlorophyll 
absorption; i.e., low vegetation reflectance.  3) The near-infrared band (790 to 
890), which penetrates best through the atmosphere (transmittance is about 95 
percent for a clear atmosphere model) and light haze. Vegetation stands out 
brightly and water surfaces appear very dark (1 percent reflectance with a high 
attenuation coefficient: 10 to 50 m). Although silicon spectral sensitivity 
extends out to 1,100 nm, the band was not extended beyond 900 nm in order to 
avoid response modulation by atmospheric water vapor and to limit the smearing 
effect of electron diffusion within the detectors. Vegetation biomass can be 
evaluated with the red and near-infrared bands taken together. All three color 
bands are coded linearly on 8 bits, with a choice of ground-controlled preset 
gains.

For the higher ground-resolution black-and-white, or panchromatic mode, a 
broader spectral band was required. In order to retain the capability for 
texture analysis in support of the color mode and a high information content 
over vegetated areas, the interval 510 to 730 nm was chosen for the broad band. 
The basic coding scheme is 6-bits linear with a choice of eight selectable 
preset gains. Higher radiometric resolution can be selected by ground command of 
a differential Pulse Code Modulation System, which compresses each 3-pixel 
packet to 18 bits, while retaining an 8-bit equivalent radiometric resolution.

4. Equipment

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

The HRV instruments form images without any moving mechanical part (e.g., 
scanning mirrors, disc choppers, or mechanical modulators). The HRV telescope is 
a pseudo-Schmidt design, since the corrector plate is a spherical doublet. In 
this folded arrangement, sufficient room is available in the focal plane for a 
dichroic prism separator followed by four multilinear array mounts. The spectral 
regions and bandwidths of each channel are given in the table below:

Channel  Wavelength (µm)
-------  ----------------
1        0.50 -  0.59
2        0.61 -  0.68
3        0.79 -  0.89

4.1.1 Collection Environment

The BOREAS SPOT level-3s imagery was acquired through the CCRS.  The SPOT 
satellites orbit Earth at a mean altitude of 805 km.  Radiometric corrections 
and systematic geometric corrections are applied to produce the images in a 
path-oriented, systematically corrected spatial form.  A full level-3s SPOT 
image contains 4,500 pixels in each of 3,000 lines.  Before any geometric 
corrections, the ground resolution is 20 m for bands 1-3 at nadir. The pixel 
values of the images can range from 0 to 255. This allows each pixel to be 
stored in a single-byte field.  The level-3s images were processed through the 
CCRS Geocoded Image Correction System (GICS); (Friedel, 1992).

4.1.2 Source/Platform

The BOREAS SPOT images were collected by the HRV instruments on the SPOT-2 and 
SPOT-3 satellites.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

The objectives of the SPOT mission are to 1) experiment on desirable 
characteristics of (operational) remote sensing systems; 2) build up an archive 
and make available a wide data base for cartographic and Earth exploration 
purposes; 3) experiment on improving vegetative species discrimination and 
producing forecasting by frequent access and off-nadir viewing; 4) build up a 
stereo archive of areas of real interest for purposes of photo-interpretation, 
planimetric cartography, and cartographic updating at scales of 1/100,000 and 
1/50,000; and 5) qualify the multimission platform and solar array camera in 
space.

4.1.4 Key Variables

Reflected radiation.

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

The SPOT system consists of an orbiting satellite with two HRV instruments as 
well as ground facilities for image reception, preprocessing, distribution, 
satellite monitoring, and preparation of imaging programs. The instruments are 
pointable in the across-track direction in order to allow rapid access to any 
point on the globe and acquisition of stereoscopic image pairs from different 
satellite passes. Imaging is accomplished by the Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) 
linear array using the "pushbroom" scanning principle. In a given spectral mode, 
the HRV instrument images a single line of the landscape at a given moment: all 
the points making up one line are analyzed simultaneously. The motion of the 
orbiting satellite and the corresponding shift of the imaged line allow 
acquisition of a complete image.

Image acquisitions are commanded by the satellite's onboard computer. An imaging 
sequence can comprise a succession of images acquired in panchromatic or 
multispectral mode (note that the satellite cannot operate the HRV sensors in 
both modes at the same time) and changes in the viewing direction of each of the
two HRV instruments (rotation of the strip-selection mirror at the entrance of 
each instrument). Data generated by the instruments are transmitted to the 
ground over the payload-specific X-band telemetry link or stored by means of two 
onboard recorders for later recovery by the Toulouse imagery receiving facility.

4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

The HRV was designed to achieve a multispectral capability with a nominal nadir 
ground sampling interval of 20 m x 20 m; a 10-m sampling interval in a 
panchromatic mode. A ground resolution of 20 m over a 60-km swath is achieved 
using an array of 3,000 detectors (CCD) per spectral band, sampled every 3 
milliseconds, while a ground resolution of 10 m over the same swath width uses 
6,000 detectors per line, sampled every 1.5 milliseconds.

4.2   Calibration

The calibration unit is an auxiliary device designed to illuminate the detection 
unit by providing light at the entrance to the HRV telescope (the strip 
selection mirror having been previously moved to the calibration position). One 
of two light sources may be selected: the calibration lamp or the fiber-optic 
sunlight collector. The calibration lamp illuminates all 16 CCD linear arrays of 
the HRV detection unit and is used for relative calibration (sometimes referred 
to as "in-band calibration".The fiber-optic sunlight collector illuminates a 
small number of detectors in each spectral band with sunlight gathered from 
outside the HRV instrument at certain periods and is used for absolute, 
interband, multidate calibration.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

The BOREAS SPOT level-3s imagery was acquired through CCRS.  Radiometric and 
systematic geometric corrections are applied to produce the images in a path-
oriented, systematically corrected spatial form.  A full level-3s SPOT image 
contains 4,500 pixels in each of 3,000 lines.  Before any geometric corrections, 
the ground resolution is 20 m for bands 1-3 at nadir. The pixel values of the 
images can range from 0 to 255. This allows each pixel to be stored in a single-
byte field.  The level-3s images were processed through the CCRS GICS.

7. Data Description

7.1 Spatial Characteristics

7.1.1 Spatial Coverage

The BOREAS level-3s SPOT images cover portions of the Northern Study Area (NSA) 
and the Southern Study Area (SSA) which are located in the northeast and 
southwest portions of the overall region.  A full SPOT scene covers 
approximately 3,600 square kilometers.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) corner coordinates of the SSA are:

             Latitude     Longitude
             --------     ---------
Northwest    54.321 N     106.228 W
Northeast    54.225 N     104.237 W
Southwest    53.515 N     106.321 W
Southeast    53.420 N     104.368 W


The NAD83 corner coordinates of the NSA are:

             Latitude     Longitude

Southwest    55.542 N      99.045 W
Southeast    55.379 N      97.489 W

7.1.2 Spatial Coverage Map

Not available.

7.1.3 Spatial Resolution

Before any geometric corrections, the spatial resolution is 20 m at nadir.  
These values increase with scan angle away from the nadir path.  The level-3s 
SPOT images have had geometric corrections applied so that the spatial 
resolution for all pixels is 20 m in all bands.  These level-3s images have a 
high level of internal spatial integrity, but the actual geographic coordinates 
contained in the image header can be offset from their actual positions by as 
much as 10 km (personal communication with CCRS personnel, 1994).

7.1.4 Projection

The level-3s SPOT images are placed in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 
projection based on NAD83. Detailed projection parameter information for the 
individual images is contained in the leader file(s).

7.1.5 Grid Description

The grid spacing for each pixel in the level-3s SPOT images is 20 m in the UTM 
projection.  Detailed grid parameter information for the individual images is 
contained in the leader file(s).

7.2 Temporal Characteristics

7.2.1 Temporal Coverage

The images cover the period of 17-Apr-1994 to 30-Aug-1996.  The SPOT images

7.2.3 Temporal Resolution

The SPOT satellite revisit frequency is 26 days for each path/row.  During the 
period of 17-Apr-1994 to 30-Aug-1996, 19 images were acquired over the NSA and 
the SSA on 13 different dates.

7.3 Data Characteristics

The maximum range of digital numbers in each level-3s SPOT image band is limited 
to the range 0 (zero) to 255 so that the values can be stored in a single 8-bit 
(byte) field.

The image inventory data characteristics are defined in the companion data 
definition file (spot_3s.def).

7.4 Sample Data Record

Sample data records are defined in the companion data definition file 
(spot_3s.def).

8. Data Organization

8.1 Data Granularity

The smallest unit of data for level-3s SPOT imagery is a full SPOT scene.

All the BOREAS Level-3s SPOT Imagery: Scaled At-sensor Radiance in LGSOWG Format
Data characteristics are defined in the companion data definition file 
(spot_3s.def).

8.2 Data Format(s)

The image inventory data file contains numerical and character fields of varying 
length separated by commas. The character fields are enclosed with a single 
apostrophe marks. There are no spaces between the fields.  Data record format is 
defined in the companion data definition file(spot_3s.def).

The level-3s SPOT imagery from CCRS is stored in either a band sequential (BSQ) 
or a band interleaved by line (BIL) form.  General information on these two 
formats is provided in the subsequent sections.  Detailed information on these 
formats can be obtained from the CCRS document, Standard SPOT MLA/PLA Format, 
referenced in Section 17.1.

8.2.1 Band Sequential Format

The files associated with a BSQ SPOT scene are as follows:

File 1  volume directory
File 2  leader file band 1
File 3  SPOT band 1
File 4  trailer file band 1
File 5  leader file band 2
File 6  SPOT band 2
File 7  trailer file band 2
File 8  leader file band 2
File 9  SPOT band 3
File 10  trailer file band 2
File 11 null volume file

If there are multiple scenes on a tape, the next scene would occupy files 12-22, 
11 files exactly as above. Up to five SPOT scenes (55 files) are contained on 
one 8-mm tape. There are multiple-volume directory files on one tape media 
because the 8-mm tapes were generated by copying the original 9-track tapes, and 
each of the 9-track tapes had its own volume directory.  Each image file in BSQ 
format contains data for one spectral band.

8.2.1.1 BSQ Leader Files

File descriptor record	
Scene header record
Map projection (scene-related) ancillary record
Type 1 radiometric transformation ancillary record
Type 2 radiometric transformation ancillary record

All leader files contain fixed-length records 6,120 bytes in length and contain 
both ASCII and binary data.  For specific details, see the CCRS documentation 
referenced in Section 17.1.

8.2.1.2 BSQ Imagery File

The BSQ image files have 3,001 records, with each record containing 4,500 bytes.  
The first record in this file is a header record, followed by 3,000 image 
records.

The contents of the Scene Header record are specified by Landsat Ground Station 
Operations Working Group (LGSOWG) Technical Working Group (LTWG) standards and 
contain information relating to the mission, sensor parameters, processing 
options, and geometric parameters for the sensor.

Each image record contains 32 bytes of prefix data, 4,320 bytes of image data, 
and 36 bytes of suffix data. Image data consist of digital numbers and 0s as 
fillers.  The record size is 4,500 bytes.  Although the width of the image is 
nominally 3,000 pixels, the number of pixels in the image grows proportionally 
with the view angle.  All 4,500 pixels were included because none of the 
parameters in any of the header records seemed to be reliable for determining 
how many nonzero pixels there were in a particular record. 

Each image is oriented so that pixel 1, line 1 is in the upper left-hand corner 
(i.e., northwest) of the screen display.  Pixels and lines progress left to 
right and top to bottom so that pixel n, line n is in the lower right-hand 
corner.

8.2.1.3 BSQ Trailer File

The trailer file contains information associated with the image data not always 
available before writing the image data, such as data and recording quality and 
data summaries.  Each trailer file contains a file descriptor record and trailer 
records for all bands of imagery in the associated imagery file.  All trailer 
files contain fixed-length records 4,320 bytes in length and contain both ASCII 
and binary data.

8.2.2 Band Interleaved by Line Format

The files associated with a BIL SPOT scene are as follows:
          
File 1  volume directory
File 2  leader file bands 1-3
File 3  SPOT bands 1-3 
File 4  trailer
File 5  null volume file

If there are multiple scenes on a tape, the next scene would occupy files 6-10, 
five files exactly as above. Up to four TM scenes (20 files) are contained on 
one 8-mm tape. There are multiple volume directory files on one tape media 
because the 8-mm tapes were generated from copying the original 9-track tapes, 
and each of the 9-track tapes had its own volume directory.  The image files in 
BIL format contain image data for all three spectral bands.

8.2.2.1 BIL Leader Files

A detailed description may be found in the SPOT Standard CCT Format document 
from SPOT Image Corporation.

Record 1: 		Header File descriptor			3960 bytes.
Record 2: 		Header					3960 bytes.
Record 3: 		Ancillary Ephemeris/Attitude 		3960 bytes.
Record 4-21: 	Ancillary Radiometric/Calibration   3960 bytes.
Record 22-24: 	Ancillary Histogram			3960 bytes.
Record 25: 		Ancillary Map projection		3960 bytes.
Record 26: 		GCP/RCP					3960 bytes.
Record 27: 		Annotation					3960 bytes.

8.2.2.2 BIL Imagery File

The BIL image files are contained in a single file of 9,000 5,400-byte records.

Each image is oriented so that pixel 1, line 1 is in the upper left-hand corner 
(i.e., northwest) of the screen display.  Pixels and lines progress left to 
right and top to bottom so that pixel n, line n is in the lower right-hand 
corner.

8.2.2.3 BIL Trailer File

The trailer file contains information associated with the image data not always 
available before writing the image data, such as data and recording quality and 
data summaries.  Each trailer file contains a file descriptor record and trailer 
records for all bands of imagery in the associated imagery file.  All trailer 
files contain fixed length records 4,320 bytes in length and contain both ASCII 
and binary data.

9.1 Formulae

9.1.1 Derivation Techniques and Algorithms

Not applicable.

9.2 Data Processing Sequence

The SPOT data are included in BORIS only as a supplement to the Landsat TM data.  
Therefore, the SPOT images were not processed beyond level-3s.

9.2.1 Processing Steps

BORIS Staff processes a level-3s SPOT image by:

1) Extracting pertinent header information from the level-3s image product and
   writing it to a disk file.
2) Reading the information in the disk file and loading the data base with
   needed information.

9.2.2 Processing Changes

None.

9.3 Calculations

9.3.1 Special Corrections/Adjustments

None.

9.3.2 Calculated Variables

None.

9.4 Graphs and Plots

None.

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

Errors could arise in the acquired imagery from location inaccuracy, distortion 
of lengths, anisomorphism, the instrument's local coherence, multispectral 
registrability, and relief plotting inaccuracy. Other errors could arise from 
inherent radiometric imperfections of the sensors.

10.2 Quality Assessment

10.2.1 Data Validation by Source

Whatever the processing level, the geometric quality of the image depends on the 
accuracy of the viewing geometry.

Spectral errors could arise from image-wide signal-to-noise ratio, saturation, 
cross-talk, spikes, response normalization caused by a change in gain.

10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment

Assessment of accuracy of the absolute radiometric constants is difficult. The 
uncertainties in prelaunch and postlaunch updates of the absolute calibration 
constants are nominally specified to be less than 10%. A root mean square (rms) 
summing of known errors in the prelaunch calibration suggests that this may be a 
reasonable estimate of overall uncertainty in the prelaunch calibration.

10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters

Not available at this revision.

10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments

Images are screened for level of cloud cover before BORIS processing.

10.2.5 Data Verification by Data Center

BORIS Staff used developed software to extract information for logging the data 
into a relational data base.  The software also read through the records of the 
files checking for proper record sizes.  A subset of the images was unpacked and 
displayed for visual review.  None of the displayed images showed any notable 
abnormalities.

None.

14. Software

14.1 Software Description

BORIS Staff developed software and command procedures to:

1) Extract header information from level-3s SPOT images on tape and write to
   ASCII files on disk.
2) Read the ASCII disk file and log the level-3 SPOT image products into 
   the Oracle data base tables.
3) Convert coordinates in the leader file(s) between the geographic systems of
   (latitude, longitude), UTM (northing, easting), and BOREAS (x,y) grid
   locations.

The software mentioned under items 1 and 2 is written in the C language and is 
operational on VAX 6410 and MicroVAX 3100 systems at GSFC.  The primary 
dependencies in the software are the tape input/output (I/O) library and the 
Oracle data base utility routines.

The geographic coordinate conversion utility (BOR_CORD) has been tested and used 
on Macintosh, IBM PC, VAX, Silicon Graphics, and Sun workstations.

14.2 Software Access

All of the described software is available upon request.  BORIS staff would 
appreciate knowing of any problems discovered with the software, but cannot 
promise to fix them.
