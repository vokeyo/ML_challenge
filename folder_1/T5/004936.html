<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 28pt"><STRONG>Terrorism Insurance and Premiums</STRONG></SPAN>


<P>	As the Senate debates the terrorism reinsurance bill, it would be prudent not to oversell
its benefits.  While we hope a federal backstop will help the economy and prepare markets for
another attack, it would be unwise to claim that a federal terrorism insurance law will drive down
insurance premiums in general.  It won't.  By most accounts, businesses and property owners will
continue to pay dramatically higher insurance premiums long after a terrorism reinsurance bill is
enacted.  


<P>	Earlier this year, private industry advocates of federal terrorism insurance released talking
points that listed high-profile properties and construction projects facing dramatically higher
insurance premiums.  The point was to illustrate that property owners were paying substantially
higher premiums for property and casualty insurance.  Here is an example:

<blockquote>
<P>	Events of September 11 Caused Major Insurance Industry Losses:  Estimates
range from $36 billion to $54 billion.  As a result, the reinsurance industry (not
legally obligated to cover terrorism) has generally stopped covering terrorist acts. 
Forty-five states (covering about two-thirds of commercial insurance) have
allowed primary insurers to also exclude acts of terrorism from property and
casualty coverage.  Even with the state exclusions, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">premiums for property and
casualty insurance increased approximately 30 to 50 percent in the wake of the
attacks</SPAN>.

</blockquote>

<P>	This example confuses property and casualty insurance that<EM> covers </EM>terrorist acts with
insurance that <EM>excludes</EM> terrorist attacks.  The impression is left that passage of federal terrorism
insurance legislation will target coverage that doesn't include terrorist attacks and drive down all
property and casualty rates. 


<P>	 The reality is that premiums for <EM>all</EM> property and casualty insurance policies are rising,
even those that <EM>exclude</EM> coverage for terrorist attacks, and they started rising well before 9/11. 
Insurance premiums are rising for three primary reasons:  


<UL>
  <LI>	First, rates of return for insurance company reserves have been declining with the
stock market for the past two years.  </LI>
  <LI>	Second, insurers wrote very aggressive policies during the 1990s that have had
higher than expected costs.  </LI>
  <LI>	And third, the loss of $30-60 billion in reserves from the attack of September 11<SUP>th</SUP>
lowered those returns further.  </LI>
</UL>


<P>Here's an excerpt from the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> (4/11/02) on the issue:

<blockquote>
<P>	The higher premiums many small and midsize businesses hundreds of miles from
New York City now face are the legacy of a decade of imprudence among insurers
-  a period that combined a relentless price war with aggressive risk-taking. From
1993 to 2000, underwriters slashed rates, sometimes as much as 40 percent, and
fought for customers by loosening terms on all types of business policies - from
directors-and-officers' liability coverage to medical-malpractice packages to
workers' compensation insurance….


<P>	Insurers eventually reached the limit. By 1999, they were paying out, on average,
$1.07 in claims and related expenses for every $1 of premium received on
business coverage. During the bull market of the '90s, insurers could sustain these
losses on underwriting because the shortfalls were more than offset by investment
income the insurers earned on premiums.


<P>	Now financial markets have soured, and so have insurers' investment yields. The
companies have also been hurt because claims on the cheap policies they wrote in
recent years have come in much higher than they originally estimated -
optimistically, in the eyes of some critics. And all this was happening before Sept.
11.
</blockquote>

<P>The General Accounting Office (GAO) made the same point:

<blockquote>
<P>	Prices were already increasing for commercial coverage prior to September 11<SUP>th</SUP>.
Industry participants have told us that the increases were part of the underwriting
cycle normal in this insurance market.  Industry losses from the terrorist attack
almost certainly exacerbated the rise in prices, as any major catastrophe would
have.  [GAO Testimony, House Committee on Financial Services, 2/27/02]
</blockquote>

<P>The point is underscored by other observers as well: 

<P> 

<blockquote>
<P>	But analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's said that while the events of Sept. 11
accelerated the increase in U.S. commercial real estate insurance premiums,
property and casualty insurance costs had already begun rising in 2000,
independent of terrorism-coverage costs.  [<EM>Insurance Chronicle</EM>, 5/20/02]


<P>	Global property and casualty rates were already on an upward trend before
September 11, as insurers realised that they could no longer rely on investment
returns to conceal years of poor underwriting.  [<EM>Financial Times</EM> (London),
5/24/02]
</blockquote>

<P>	</SPAN>A temporary federal reinsurance program may help restore confidence in the economy
and certain industries, but it should not be oversold. </SPAN>Federal terrorism coverage will do little or
nothing to reduce insurance rates for insurance coverage that doesn't cover terrorist acts.  It
probably won't help those properties and businesses that already have terrorism insurance.  As
far as premiums go, only those properties and businesses that have resisted buying terrorism
insurance to this point are the clear winners under S. 2600.  </SPAN></SPAN>
