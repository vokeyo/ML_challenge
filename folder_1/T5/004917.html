<EM>Alonzo Delano, born in New York in 1809, moved to the

    Midwest as a teenager. In 1849, he joined a local California Company and prepared to

    travel overland to California. He describes some of his experiences on the journey to

    California in the following excerpts from his book published in 1857. How do Delano's

    observations about the weather, care of livestock, pace of travel, and throwing items away

    during the crossing influence your thinking about what it was like to travel on the

    overland trails?</EM>

	The country resembled that of the previous

    day, with no water except occasionally in sloughs; and as we looked over the broad expanse

    of prairie, till earth and sky seemed to blend, we could not repress a feeling of

    loneliness. . . .

<P>Our road, like that of yesterday, was over

    broad table-land, and we were able to keep a direct south-south-west course. But where the

    dickens was the St. Joseph road? Where were we?--and where had we been? We had now been

    out nineteen days upon the wilderness. Our object in taking this new route had been to

    save time, and of getting in advance of other trains; and the question naturally arose,

    Had we succeeded? Had we gained anything by our erratic course? . . . Anxiously we drove

    on, with &quot;hope deferred,&quot; wishing that the next knoll would bring the long

    wished for object to our vision. This feeling was shared by all, when, about four o'clock,

    our captain, who had rode ahead four or five miles, was seen riding towards us at full

    speed, swinging his hat joyfully, when a shout was raised, &quot;The road is found; the

    road is found!&quot;. . .

<P>
    
     . . . From the latter place [St. Joseph, Missouri] we had been actually traveling

    twenty-four days, nineteen of which were upon the prairie, to reach this point; while the

    trains that had come by the road, direct, had come through without difficulty in eleven

    days. This was gaining time and getting ahead with a vengeance! . . . Distance sixteen

    miles. View

<P>Morning dawned gloomily enough. It seemed as

    if a water spout was discharging its floods upon us. Our rain storms at home were only

    gentle showers compared with this. The wind blew a hurricane . . . In this dreadful storm

    hundreds of cattle were lost, and some trains were almost ruined; some lost half, while

    others had only one or two yoke left; and for several days after, we met many persons who

    were searching for their cattle, unable to proceed. No situation can be more deplorable

    than that of being left upon a broad prairie, hundreds of miles from aid, without the

    means of locomotion. We found families, with women and helpless children, in this sad

    condition, and yet we were without means to give them relief. . . . It continued to rain

    without cessation through the day, and we turned into our damp beds with a feeling of

    cheerlessness, though not dispirited. Distance, nothing.

    . . .We were pained to see that many cattle

    were becoming lame, and that many showed evidences of being hard driven. In the great

    desire to get ahead, and the foolish rivalry of passing other trains, no rest was given to

    the cattle. Men placed themselves in jeopardy of becoming helpless, by imprudence, even at

    this early stage of the journey, where no human aid could be rendered; and were I to make

    the trip again, I would make it a point to stop every seventh day, where it was

    practicable, if from no scruples of conscience, certainly from dictates of humanity; and I

    do not hesitate to declare, that by doing so there would be a saving of time in the end,

    for both man and beast would more than make up the time so lost, by renewed vigor from

    rest. We daily saw many cattle giving out from want of rest, and imprudence in driving

    them beyond their strength, and when they reached the barren plains beyond the Rocky

    Mountains, many were unable to drag the wagons, even after the loads had been reduced, by

    throwing away all but barely enough provisions to sustain life to the end of the journey.

    Distance, fourteen miles. View the

    We took advantage of our leisure in airing our

    clothes and provisions, and in making all necessary repairs. Another important matter

    occupied the consideration, not only of our own train, but of many companies encamped near

    us. Loading our wagons too heavily with cumbrous and weighty articles, and with

    unnecessary supplies of provisions, had been a general fault, and the cattle began to

    exhibit signs of fatigue. We resolved, therefore, to part with everything which was not

    absolutely necessary, and to shorten the dimension of our wagons so that they would run

    easier. To sell superfluous articles was quite impossible, though I was fortunate enough

    to find a market for fifty pounds of coffee. Every emigrant was abundantly supplied, and

    we were compelled to throw away a quantity of iron, steel, trunks, valises, old clothes,

    and boots, of little value; and I may observe here that we subsequently found the road

    lined with cast-off articles, piles of bacon, flour, wagons, groceries, clothing, and

    various other articles, which had been left, and the waste and destruction of property was

    enormous. In this the selfish nature of man was plainly exhibited. In many instances the

    property thus left was rendered useless. We afterwards found sugar on which turpentine had

    been poured, flour in which salt and dirt had been thrown, and wagons broken to pieces, or

    partially burned, clothes torn to pieces, so that they could not be worn, and a wanton

    waste made of valuable property, simply because the owners could not use it themselves,

    and were determined that nobody else should. There were occasionally honorable exceptions.

    The wagons were left unharmed by the road side; the bacon, flour, and sugar were nicely

    heaped up, with a card, directed to any one who stood in need, to use freely in welcome. . . .

    . . . Fort Laramie is simply a trading post,

    standing about a mile above the ford, and is a square enclosure of adobe walls, one side

    of which forms the walls of the buildings. The entrance into the court is through a gate

    of sufficient strength to resist the Indians, but would be of little account if besieged

    by a regular army. Its neat, white-washed walls presented a welcome sight to us, after

    being so long from anything like a civilized building, and the motly crowd of emigrants,

    with their array of wagons, cattle, horses, and mules, gave a pleasant appearance of life

    and animation. . . .

<P>
    
    Around the fort were many wagons, which had been sold or abandoned by emigrants. A

    strong, heavy wagon could be bought for from five to fifteen dollars. In ordinary seasons

    the company were able to keep some small supplies for emigrants, but such was the rush

    now, that scarcely anything could be obtained, even at the most exorbitant prices. . . .
