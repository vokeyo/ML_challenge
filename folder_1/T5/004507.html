    <td colspan="2">Maine State Police trooper Greg Mitchell is investigating the crash. Witnesses indicated that the driver of the white car was traveling east on Needles Eye Road at a high rate of speed and hit a pickup truck head on. The pickup was engaged in pulling a SUV from the mud at the side of Needles Eye Road. Several vehicles had apparently been engaged in an activity known as &quot;mudding&quot; when the SUV's driver got that vehicle stuck. The pickup truck was nearly stationary in the road at the time of the crash. Police are investigating if speed and alcohol were factors in the crash. The driver of the small car was taken to Eastern Maine Medical Center, the passenger transported by ambulance to Maine Coast Memorial Hospital. </td>
