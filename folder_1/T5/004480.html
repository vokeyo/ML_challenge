When Retrieving Flow Meter

</b></p>
<hr>

<p><b>SUMMARY:</b></p>

<p>On May 28, 2003, a 32-year-old male city engineer collapsed in a manhole while 
  attempting to retrieve a flow meter and was pronounced dead after he was transported 
  to a hospital. On the day of the incident, the victim, a co-worker (an assistant 
  engineer) and a student intern drove to a landfill to replace a battery of a 
  flow meter that had been placed in a manhole. Once they arrived at the site, 
  the victim opened the manhole cover with a pickaxe. The manhole was 7&#8217;4&#8221; 
  deep and 24&#8221; in diameter at the point of entry. There were four iron rungs 
  mounted into the cement wall of the manhole to form a ladder. The flow meter 
  was attached to the top rung that was 34 inches below the manhole opening by 
  a &#8220;U&#8221; shaped spring loaded handle. The victim used a hook made of 
  a wire hanger to catch a string that was looped and tied around the handle of 
  the flow meter. When he was pulling and lifting the meter, the weight of the 
  flow meter caused the wire hook to straighten and the meter fell to the bottom 
  of the manhole. The victim quickly descended into the manhole to retrieve the 
  meter. Once at the bottom, the victim picked up and placed the flow meter on 
  the top rung. Just as he was about to ascend, he lost consciousness and collapsed 
  in the bottom of the manhole. The assistant engineer immediately called &#8220;911&#8221; 
  on his cell phone. The fire department arrived at the site and immediately started 
  the confined space rescue procedure. The victim was extricated from the manhole 
  in approximately 20 minutes. He was transported to a nearby hospital where he 
  was pronounced dead. According to the fire department monitoring data, the oxygen 
  concentration at the bottom of the manhole was 2.1% and the flammable vapors 
  exceeded 60% of the lower explosive level (LEL) at the time of the rescue. </p>
<p>New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (NY FACE) investigators 
  concluded that to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, employers 
  should:<br>
</p>
<div align="left"> 
  <ul>
    <li><em><strong>Implement a confined space entry program for all workers who 
      are or could be exposed to confined space hazards;<br>
      <br>
      </strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Provide immediate training and periodic refresher training 
      to all employees who may be exposed to confined space hazards;<br>
      <br>
      </strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Evaluate the sewer flow monitoring procedure and modify it 
      to reduce workers&#8217; risk;<br>
      <br>
      </strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Assign a trained safety and health professional to oversee 
      the implementation and maintenance of the city&#8217;s safety and health 
      programs;<br>
      <br>
      </strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Establish a centralized safety committee with both management 
      and employee representatives to assist in the development, implementation, 
      and oversight of the safety and health programs.</strong></em><br>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p align="left"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>On May 28, 2003 at approximately 2:30 PM, a 32-year-old male city engineer 
  collapsed after entering a manhole to retrieve a flow meter. He was extricated 
  from the manhole by the fire department and transported to a hospital where 
  he was pronounced dead. New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation 
  (NY FACE) staff initially learned of the incident through a newspaper article 
  on May 29, 2003. On June 17, 2003, two NY FACE investigators conducted an on-site 
  fatality evaluation. During the site visit, the investigators met with the representatives 
  of the city government that employed the victim, interviewed the witnesses to 
  the fatal incident, and inspected the landfill manhole where the fatal incident 
  occurred. Additional information was provided by the city police and fire departments 
  and the regional office of the Public Employees Safety and Health Bureau (PESH) 
  of the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL). The police report and Medical 
  Examiner&#8217;s report were also reviewed. </p>
<p>The victim&#8217;s employer, a city government, employed a total of 150 full-time 
  and 70 part-time employees at the time of the investigation. Non-managerial 
  employees were represented by four labor unions. The victim was classified as 
  managerial personnel and was not represented by a union. At the time of the 
  incident, the city did not have a safety and health professional on staff to 
  oversee the implementation and maintenance of the city&#8217;s safety and health 
  programs. All the safety and health programs were administered and maintained 
  by individual department managers. The city did not have an active safety committee 
  at the time of the incident. According to the city administration, the engineering 
  department where the victim worked did not have a confined space program nor 
  did it provide employees with awareness training on confined space hazards.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><b>INVESTIGATION</b></p>
<p>One of the tasks performed by the engineering department was to monitor the 
  city&#8217;s sanitary sewer. Material from the city&#8217;s sanitary sewer was 
  treated by a water treatment plant in an adjacent town. As required by the town, 
  the city had to monitor the sewer flow rate. The flow rate was monitored by 
  battery-operated flow meters that were placed in three manholes: two located 
  on a city street and one in an inactive landfill. The monitoring procedure that 
  started in the summer of 2002 included replacing the rechargeable batteries 
  every Wednesday and downloading the flow rate data every Friday. </p>
<p>The fatal incident occurred in the landfill manhole. The landfill was formerly 
  a solid waste management facility that was operated by the city until 1985 when 
  it ceased operation. The manhole was a primary location that received the total 
  leachate flow from the entire landfill. The flow meter had not registered any 
  leachate flow since the monitoring started until the date of the incident when 
  the monitoring was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, May 28<sup>th</sup>, 2003, the day of the incident, the victim drove the 
  assistant engineer and the intern to the manhole locations to replace the flow 
  meter batteries. Prior to the incident, they had finished changing batteries 
  on two of the three flow meters. At approximately 2:30 PM, they drove to the 
  landfill to replace the last battery. They parked the city vehicle at the landfill 
  entrance and walked approximately a quarter mile through the field toward the 
  manhole located on the south side of the landfill. The victim was carrying a 
  pickaxe and the intern the spare battery. Once they arrived at the manhole, 
  the victim mentioned that there should be a wire hanger lying on the grass somewhere 
  that he used to assist in lifting the meter out of the manhole. He searched 
  and found the hanger. The victim then opened the manhole cover with the pickaxe.</p>
<p>The manhole was 7&#8217;4&#8221; deep and its inner diameter was 24&#8221; 
  (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). It looked dry at the time of the incident according 
  to the witnesses. There were four iron rungs mounted into the cement wall of 
  the manhole to form a ladder. The flow meter (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>), 
  weighing approximately 15 pounds, was attached to the top rung (34 inches below 
  the manhole opening) by means of a &#8220;U&#8221; shaped spring loaded handle. 
  A string was looped and tied around the handle of the flow meter.<a name="fig1"></a></p>

<p>After removing the manhole cover, the victim proceeded to retrieve the flow 
  meter. He knelt next to the manhole opening and reached down with the wire hanger 
  that was bent on one end to hook the string on the flow meter handle. The victim 
  leaned over and across the manhole opening when trying to hook the string, which 
  took a couple of seconds. He then pulled the string toward himself on an angle 
  to disengage the spring-loaded flow meter handle. He successfully freed the 
  meter from the rung and started lifting the meter with the wire hanger. The 
  weight of the flow meter caused the wire hook to straighten and the meter fell 
  to the bottom of the manhole. The plastic cover of the meter appeared to have 
  come open. Although the battery bounced out of its case and the two bottles 
  of desiccants fell out of their holders, they were all still attached to the 
  meter. According to the witnesses, the victim commented that the meter did not 
  look too damaged. He then quickly climbed down into the manhole to retrieve 
  the meter.<a name="fig2"></a></p>

<p>Once at the bottom, the victim made a comment about a foul odor in the manhole. 
  He then knelt down, picked up the flow meter, turned around toward the ladder, 
  and placed the meter on the top rung. While he grasped the top rung with both 
  hands as if in preparation to ascend, his arms began to shake violently and 
  he lost consciousness and collapsed backwards onto the floor of the manhole.</p>
<p>According to both witnesses, the entire incident from the time that the victim 
  entered the manhole until he collapsed took only a minute or less. The assistant 
  engineer immediately called &#8220;911&#8221; on his cell phone while the intern 
  ran to the street to call for help. The fire department arrived at the site 
  within four minutes and immediately started the rescue procedure by following 
  the confined space rescue protocol. The victim was extricated from the manhole 
  in approximately 20 minutes, and transported to a nearby hospital where he was 
  pronounced dead. According to the fire department monitoring data taken at the 
  time of the rescue, the oxygen concentration at the bottom of the manhole was 
  2.1% and the flammable gas or vapor exceeded 60% of the lower explosive level 
  (LEL).</p>

<p align="left"><b>CAUSE OF DEATH</b></p>
<p>The cause of death was reported as asphyxia with methane gas.</p>

<p align="left"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS/DISCUSSION</b></p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation #1: Employers should implement a confined space 
  entry program for all workers who are or could be exposed to confined space 
  hazards.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> At the time of the incident, the engineering department 
  did not have a confined space entry program, nor were there any effective measures 
  in place to prevent the workers from entering permit-required confined spaces. 
  Employers should conduct a worksite inspection to identify and then appropriately 
  mark all confined spaces. A confined space entry program should then be developed 
  and implemented that would include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>evaluation to determine whether entry is necessary or whether the task can 
    be performed from the outside;</li>
  <li>issuance of a confined space entry permit by the employer;</li>
  <li>posting of confined space entry warning signs; 
  <li>testing the air quality in the confined space when entry is necessary, to 
    ensure:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>oxygen levels of at least 19.5%,</li>
    <li>flammable range of less than 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL),</li>
    <li>absence of toxic air contaminants;</li>
  </ul>
  <li>training of workers and supervisors in the selection and use of : 
    <ul>
      <li>respiratory equipment,</li>
      <li>environmental test equipment,</li>
      <li>lifelines,</li>
      <li>rescue equipment,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>training of employees in safe work procedures in and around confined spaces;</li>
  <li>training of employees in confined space rescue procedures;</li>
  <li>use of proper ventilation in confined spaces;</li>
  <li>monitoring of air quality prior to entering confines spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  <strong><em>Recommendation #2: The employer should identify the workers who 
  are exposed to confined space hazards and provide immediate employee training 
  and periodic refresher training.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The employer should identify the workers who are 
  potentially exposed to confined space hazards through job hazard analysis and 
  provide immediate training to those employees. The employer should ensure that 
  the workers understand the nature of the confined space hazards and are familiar 
  with the standard confined space entry procedures. The training should be provided 
  before an employee is assigned the specific tasks. Refresher training should 
  be provided at least annually or whenever there is a change in assigned duties, 
  a change in confined space operations, or a change or update in the confined 
  space entry procedures.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong><em>Recommendation #3: The employer should evaluate the sewer flow monitoring 
  procedure and modify it to reduce employee exposures to the confined space hazards.</em> 
  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The employer should evaluate and modify the flow 
  monitoring procedure to reduce the risk by implementing feasible engineering 
  controls. For example, the flow meter may be placed outside a manhole to avoid 
  confined space entry; and downloading data and battery replacement may be performed 
  at the same time, instead of on different days. At the time of the incident, 
  the victim used a regular pickaxe to open the cover of the manhole where the 
  flammable gas and vapor concentration exceeded 60% of LEL. Spark proof tools 
  should be used for manhole cover removal and inside the manhole to reduce the 
  fire and explosion hazard. Proper sturdy tools should be used to retrieve the 
  flow meters. When installing the engineering controls, the confined space entry 
  procedures should be strictly followed.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong><em>Recommendation #4: The employer should assign a trained safety and 
  health professional to oversee the development, implementation, and oversight 
  of the city&#8217;s safety and health programs.</em> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> At the time of the fatal incident, all the safety 
  and health responsibilities were placed at the department level. The employer 
  should assign a trained safety and health professional who has the knowledge 
  in recognizing, evaluating and controlling specific occupational hazards to 
  oversee the city&#8217;s safety and health programs. The chain-of-command and 
  individual responsibility and accountability should be clearly defined. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong><em>Recommendation #5: The employer should establish a centralized safety 
  committee with both management and employee representatives to assist in the 
  development, implementation, and oversight of the safety and health programs.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> A safety committee is an important component of 
  a comprehensive safety and health program. A functioning safety committee can 
  be an effective tool in identifying occupational hazards and implementing control 
  and preventive measures. A citywide safety committee with both management and 
  employee representatives should be established. The committee should conduct 
  monthly meetings and periodic workplace safety and health inspections.</p>

  fatal occupational injuries. Under a cooperative agreement with the National 
  Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the NYS DOH FACE program 
  collects information on occupational fatalities in New York State (excluding 
  New York City) and targets specific types of fatalities for evaluation. NYS 
  FACE investigators evaluate information from multiple sources. Findings are 
  summarized in narrative reports that include recommendations for preventing 
  similar events in the future. These recommendations are distributed to employers, 
  workers, and other organizations interested in promoting workplace safety. The 
  FACE program does not determine fault or legal liability associated with a fatal
