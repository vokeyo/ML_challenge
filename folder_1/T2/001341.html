 June 1995<br><hr>A SPECIAL MESSAGE

The Board of Education has taken an important step to raise the
expectations for all students in Virginia's public schools by
adopting new Standards of Learning in four core subject areas: 
mathematics, science, English, and history and social science.

The new Standards of Learning are important because they set
reasonable targets and expectations for what teachers need to teach
and students need to learn.  Clear, concise academic standards will
let parents and teachers know what is expected of students, and
each student's performance and achievement can be measured against
the standards.  This requirement provides greater accountability on
the part of the public schools and gives the local school boards
the autonomy and flexibility they need to offer programs that best
meet the educational needs of students.

The standards contained in this publication are the result of an
unprecedented partnership of educators and citizens.  Under the
leadership of four school divisions beginning in April 1994,
thousands of Virginia's parents, teachers, principals, school board
members, and community leaders contributed many hours of time to
help review and revise drafts of proposals for the new standards. 
National experts were consulted.  Public meetings were held across
the state to hear from citizens.  Thousands attended, and hundreds
more wrote letters to share their suggestions.  All of the comments
and ideas were reviewed by the Board of Education as the standards
were developed.

One of the most important things that schools and communities can
do together is to set clear, rigorous, and measurable academic
expectations for young people.  The new academic standards adopted
by the Board of Education are part of Virginia's efforts to provide
challenging educational programs in our public schools.

Standards of Learning

The Standards of Learning for Mathematics identify academic content
for essential components of the mathematics curriculum at different
grade levels for Virginia's public schools.  Standards are
identified for kindergarten through grade eight and for a core set
of high school courses.  Throughout a student's mathematics
schooling from kindergarten through grade eight, specific content
strands or topics are included.  These content strands are Number
and Number Sense; Computation and Estimation; Measurement;
Geometry; Probability and Statistics; and Patterns,  Functions, and
Algebra.  The Standards of Learning for each strand progress in
complexity at each grade level and throughout the high school
courses.

The Standards of Learning are not intended to encompass the entire
curriculum for a given grade level or course or to prescribe how
the content should be taught.  Teachers are encouraged to go beyond
the standards and to select instructional strategies and assessment
methods appropriate for their students.

Goals
Students today require stronger mathematical knowledge and skills
to pursue higher education, to compete in a technologically
oriented workforce, and to be informed citizens.  Students must
gain an understanding of fundamental ideas in arithmetic,
measurement, geometry, probability, data analysis and statistics,
and algebra and functions, and develop proficiency in mathematical
skills.  In addition, students must learn to use a variety of
methods and tools to compute, including paper and pencil, mental
arithmetic, estimation, and calculators.  Graphing utilities,
spreadsheets, calculators, computers, and other forms of electronic
information technology are now standard tools for mathematical
problem solving in science, engineering, business and industry,
government, and practical affairs.  Hence, the use of technology
must be an integral part of teaching and learning.  However,
facility in the use of technology shall not be regarded as a
substitute for a student's understanding of quantitative concepts
and relationships or for proficiency in basic computations.  Please
note the computer/technology standards following the grade five and
grade eight standards, respectively.  The teaching of these skills
should be the shared responsibility of teachers of all disciplines.

The content of the mathematics standards is intended to support the
following four goals for students:  becoming mathematical problem
solvers, communicating mathematically, reasoning mathematically,
and making mathematical connections. 

Problem Solving
Students will apply mathematical concepts and skills and the
relationships among them to solve problem situations of varying
complexities.  Students also will recognize and create problems
from real-life data and situations within and outside mathematics
and then apply appropriate strategies to find an acceptable
solution.  To accomplish this goal, students will need to develop a
repertoire of skills and strategies for solving a variety of
problem types.  A major goal of the mathematics program is to help
students become competent mathematical problem solvers.

Mathematical Communication
Students will use the language of mathematics, including
specialized vocabulary and symbols, to represent and describe
mathematical ideas, generalizations, and relationships. 
Representing, discussing, reading, writing, and listening to
mathematics will help students to clarify their thinking and deepen
their understanding of the mathematics being studied.

Mathematical Reasoning
Students will learn and apply inductive and deductive reasoning
skills to make, test, and evaluate mathematical statements and to
justify steps in mathematical procedures.  Students will use
logical reasoning to analyze an argument and to determine whether
conclusions are valid.  In addition, students will learn to apply
proportional and spatial reasoning and to reason from graphs.

Mathematical Connections
Students will relate concepts and procedures from different topics
in mathematics to one another, using a variety of
representations-graphical, numerical, algebraic, verbal, and
physical.  Through the application of content, students will make
connections between different areas of mathematics and between
mathematics and other disciplines, especially science.  Science and
mathematics teachers and curriculum writers are encouraged to
develop mathematics and science curricula that reinforce each
other.

Standards of Learning

<b><a name="Kindergarten">Kindergarten</a></b>

The kindergarten standards place emphasis on counting; combining,
sorting, and comparing sets of objects; recognizing and describing
simple patterns; and recognizing shapes and sizes of figures and
objects. While learning mathematics, students will be actively
engaged, using concrete materials and appropriate technologies such
as calculators and computers.  However, facility in the use of
technology shall not be regarded as a substitute for a student's
understanding of quantitative concepts and relationships or for
proficiency in basic computations.

Mathematics has its own language, and the acquisition of
specialized vocabulary and language patterns is crucial to a
student's understanding and appreciation of the subject.  Students
should be encouraged to use correctly the concepts, skills,
symbols, and vocabulary identified in the following set of
standards.

Problem solving has been integrated throughout the six content
strands.  The development of problem-solving skills should be a
major goal of the mathematics program at every grade level. 
Instruction in the process of problem solving will need to be
integrated early and continuously into each student's mathematics
education.  Students must be helped to develop a wide range of
skills and strategies for solving a variety of problem types.

<b><a name="AlgebraI">Algebra I</a></b>

The standards below outline the content for a one-year course in
Algebra I.  All students are expected to achieve the Algebra I
standards. When planning for instruction, consideration should be
given to the student's cognitive level and readiness for dealing
with abstract concepts.  Students should be helped to make
connections and to build relationships between algebra and
arithmetic, geometry, and probability and statistics.  Connections
also should be made to other subject areas through practical
applications.  This approach to teaching algebra should help
students attach meaning to the abstract concepts of algebra.

These standards require students to use algebra as a tool for
representing and solving a variety of practical problems.  Tables
and graphs will be used to interpret algebraic expressions,
equations, and inequalities and to analyze functions.  Matrices
will be used to organize and manipulate data.

Calculators, computers, spreadsheets, and graphing utilities
(graphing calculators or computer graphing simulators) should be
used as tools to assist in problem solving.  Graphing utilities
enhance the understanding of functions; they provide a powerful
tool for solving and verifying solutions to equations and
inequalities.

the graph of the equation, and make generalizations that can be
applied to many graphs.

Graphing utilities (graphing calculators or computer graphing
simulators) and spreadsheets will be used by students and teachers. 
Graphing utilities enhance the understanding of realistic
applications through mathematical modeling and aid in the

        of functions, including exponential and logarithmic.

AII.10  The student will investigate and describe the
        relationships between the solution of an equation, zero of

Standards of Learning

<b><a name="ComputerMath">Computer Mathematics
</a></b>
This Computer Mathematics course is intended to provide students
with experiences in using the computer to solve problems which can
be set up as mathematical models.  Students who successfully
complete the standards for this course may earn high school
mathematics credit.  It is recognized that many students will gain
computer skills in other mathematics courses or in a separate
curriculum outside of mathematics and prior to high school.  In
such cases, the standards indicated by an asterisk (*) should be
included in the student's course of study and treated as a review
for those students who enroll in Computer Mathematics.

Even though computer ideas should be introduced in the context of
mathematical concepts, problem solving per se should be developed
in the most general sense, making the techniques applicable by
students in many other environments.  Strategies include defining
the problem; developing, refining, and implementing a plan; and
testing and revising the solution.  Programming, ranging from
simple programs involving only a few lines to complex programs
involving subprograms, should permeate the entire course.

These standards identify fundamental principles and concepts in the
field of computer science.  Students will develop and refine skills
in logic, organization, and precise expression that will enhance
learning in other disciplines.

The standards that follow are separated into two groups: those
related to programming concepts-Standards 1 through 21-and those
dealing with mathematical applications-Standards 22 and 24.  This
separation is not intended to suggest that they be treated
separately in the instructional program.  Programming concepts,
problem-solving strategies, and mathematical applications should be
integrated throughout the course.

*COM.1  The student will describe the program development cycle:
        defining the problem, planning a solution, carrying out
        the plan, debugging the program, and providing program
        documentation.

*COM.2  The student will write program specifications that
        define the constraints of a given problem.  These
        specifications include descriptions of pre-conditions,
        post-conditions, the desired output, analysis of the
        available input, and an indication as to whether or not
        the program is solvable under the given conditions.

*COM.3  The student will design a step-by-step plan (algorithm)
        to solve a given problem.  The plan will be in the form
        of a program flowchart, pseudo code, a hierarchy chart
        and/or data flow diagram.

*COM.4  The student will use operating system commands, which
        include creating a new file, opening an existing file,
        saving a file, making a printed copy (hard copy) of the
        file, and executing a program.

*COM.5  The student will divide a given problem into manageable
        sections (modules) by task and implement the solution. 
        The modules will include an appropriate user-defined
        function, subroutines, and procedures.  Enrichment
        topics can include user-defined libraries (units) and
        object-oriented programming.

*COM.6  The student will design and implement the input phase of a
        program, which will include designing screen layout and
        getting information into the program by way of user
        interaction, data statements (BASIC), and/or file input. 
        The input phase also will include methods of filtering out
        invalid data (error trapping).

*COM.7  The student will design and implement the output phase of
        a computer program, which will include designing output
        layout, accessing a variety of output devices, using
        output statements, and labeling results.

COM.8   The student will design and implement computer graphics,
        which will include topics appropriate for the available
        programming environment as well as student background. 
        Students will use graphics as an end in itself, as an
        enhancement to other output, and as a vehicle for
        reinforcing programming techniques.

COM.9   The student will define simple variable data types that
        include integer, real (fixed and scientific notation),
        character, string, and Boolean. 

COM.10  The student will use appropriate variable data types,
        including integer, real (fixed and scientific notation),
        character, string, and Boolean.  This will also include
        variables representing structured data types.

*COM.11 The student will describe the way the computer stores,
        accesses, and processes variables, including the following
        topics:  the use of variables versus constants, variables
        addresses, pointers, parameter passing, scope of
        variables, and local versus global variables.  This will
        also include use of terminology, including memory, CPU,
        RAM, ROM, baud, byte, bits, floppy disc, and hard drive.

COM.12  The student will translate a mathematical expression into
        a computer statement, which involves writing assignment
        statements and using the order of operations.

COM.13  The student will select and implement built-in (library)
        functions in processing data, which include trigonometric
        functions, absolute value functions, random number
        functions, end of line, end of file, and string.

COM.14  The student will implement conditional statements that
        include if/then, if/then/else, case statements, and
        Boolean logic.

COM.15  The student will implement a loop, including iterative
        loops, pretest loops, and post-test loops.  Other topics
        will include single entry point, single exit point,
        preconditions, post-conditions and loop invariance.

*COM.16 The student will select and implement appropriate data
        structures, including arrays (one-dimensional and/or
        multidimensional), files, and records.  Implementation
        will include creating the data structure, putting
        information into the structure, and retrieving information
        from the structure.

*COM.17 The student will implement pre-existing algorithms,
        including sort routines, search routines, and animation
        routines.

COM.18  The student will test a program using an appropriate set
        of data.  The set of test data should be appropriate and
        complete for the type of program being tested.

COM.19  The student will debug a program using appropriate
        techniques (e.g., appropriately placed controlled breaks,
        the printing of intermediate results, and other debugging
        tools available in the programming environment), and
        identify the difference between syntax errors and logic
        errors.

COM.20  The student will properly document a program including the
        preconditions and post-conditions of program segments,
        input/output specifications, the step-by-step plan, the
        test data, a sample run, and the program listing with
        appropriately placed comments.

COM.21  The student will design, write, test, debug, and document
        a complete structured program which requires the synthesis
        of many of the concepts contained in previous standards.

*COM.22 The student will solve practical consumer problems that
        involve analyzing and interpreting graphs, charts, and/or
        tables.

COM.23  The student will solve mathematical problems using
        formulas, equations, and functions.  Problems will include
        those related to geometry, business, and leisure (e.g.,
        sports and recreational activities).

COM.24  The student will solve probability, data analysis, and
        statistical problems.
