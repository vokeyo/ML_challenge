192d Day out	Saturday 18th August 1849
We are employed this day much the same as yesterday in preparing for the move  the Diggings  We find that all most all the preparation that we made on the passage will amount to but very little for everything respecting the mining Business is altogeather different from what thought it was for we have to go from 25 to 100 miles in Land from the River which makes the Transportation of our provisions & Very Expensive

We at the same time had very Briliant accounts from Fosters Bar on the Yuba River distant 100 miles  We have quite a number of our men on the sick list but none dangerously sick  the complaint is mostly a Diarrea and some of them have been badly Poisoned by what is called the Poison Oak.  [text from the left margin: 5th Sept] We Called an other meeting and finaly concluded to go to Fosters Bar on the Yuba and go to work  
The old miners tell us that it is rather erly to go to work in the mines on account of the heat but we are anxious to get there
At this meeting it was agreed that we engage two ox Teams to take our provisions and tools and there ware a Commity appointed to purchase Two Wagons and Eight Mules to take our Tents Beding Clothing and Cooking Utencials, which they did [text from left margin: 7th Sept] and on Friday 7th september we loaded the wagons.

			1849 7th September {1849/09/07}
So we started with the member above stated Leaving the remainder of the company in the camp, some of them sick, but a good many as well and as able to go with us as myself and many others that did go I think 
We traveled miles and crossed the American River at sunset (with our wagons) and then encamped for the night by laying our blankets on the ground and going to bed on them

			Sept 8th Saturday {1849/09/08}
In the morning we got our Breakfast and started on 
This Day we traveled across a Plain 25 miles in extent and without water at this season of the Year,  we ware all of us on foot Except myself  I had bought an old Horse on which I rode a part of the time  Capt David Hand had bought one half of him of me  he and others rode him as well as myself  The ox teams travel very slow and we not being acquainte with the road have to keep company with them,  The sun is shining very hot on us and no wind  some of the men would walk on a head of the teams for some miles and then lay themselves down on the ground in the hot sun (for there are no trees for shade) which was very imprudent in them and I told them so at the time,  The consequence was some of them gave out before night and had to ride on the wagons,  At 9 in the evening we arived at Nicolls Rancho all very weary and beat out,  we got some supper  spread our Blankets on the ground and all went to sleep  
There is but very little grass for the teams at this place

			9th Sept Sunday{1849/09/09}
This morning we got our Teams up and Journeyed on for 15 miles to Bar Crick[?] whare we found a good stream of water and good Grass for the Teams  9 AM we encamped for the Day.  Set up some of our Tents and at this place there are a plenty of large Trees that make a good shade,  George Post and some others complain of illnes this day say 8 or 10 of them  There are a great many wagons and People on the road to the mines and a good many of them make this a stopping place for the day, some of them are sick, some with Fever and Ague some with Diarrea, and one man that has been sun-struck

[end of page log754_058.gif]

			1849 10th Septem Monday{1849/09/10}
We started agin this morning,  Those that ware not able to walk rode on the wagons  We Traveled 18 miles this day and at 3 in the afternoon arived at Roses Ranch on the Yuba river  Good water and some grass for the Teams  
We sat up some of our Tents for the night  a number of our company complaining,  The roads have been tolerable good this day but we shall soon come to the Mountains  

			11th September {1849/09/11}
This morning at 7 oclock we crossed the Yuba river at Roses and traveled on for 5 miles  weather very hot but we came to bad water but some grass  put up for the day 
Several of our men sick,  The water is stagnant for the most part that we find on the roads and very bad for the they have no Rain throughout the summer season but all the runing streams are good water which are very few at this season of the year

			12th Septem {1849/09/12}
At 6 oclock in the morning we up stakes and started on the road  The road is getting to be bad the land very rough and hilly and a great many Dry ravines to pass over  
At noon we came to the first Hills that we have met with on our Journey and they very soon get to be mountains by the appearance they make ahead  The roads are very dusty  in some places it is a foot deep and as dry and as light as fine flour and of a Brown colour  
When we come to a bad hill or mountain we have a long Rope that we make fast to the wagon and all of us take hold of it and help the mules along  otherwise they would not be able to get along with their Loads,  We traveled for 15 miles in this way and at length we came to a very bad Hill or mountain  the ox teams gave out and could not assend the hill with boath Teams say 6 yoake of oxen to one wagon and the mule Teams were in about the same condition  
They have had no water since morning, but we know of a good stream of good water 1 1/2 miles a head and ware in hopes of getting to it tonight but find it to be impossible.  We took the Teams off from the wagons and drove them to the Crick and watered them and drove them back to the wagons and made them fast to the wagons for fear of Indians steeling them.  We then lay down at 10 oclock and went to sleep for the night.  plenty of wood on thes hills

[end of page log754_060.gif]

In speaking of the Indians we have nothing to fear from them other than them steeling  They are very cowardly but will steal the oxen or Horses when they can  we have not seen of them on our Journey as yet

			13th Septem {1849/09/13}
Thursday  This morning we backed the most of our baggag up the mountain on our backs and then put boath mule teams before one wagon with rest of load and got them up the mountain  The two men that drive the ox teams are Orogan men and aquainted with bad roads
At 10 AM we got over the mountain and crossed the crick whare whare we found grass for the Teams and turned them out to feed for they have nothing all day yesterday  yesterday we set the Tents up and encamped for the day  8 or 10 men of our company sick  some of Poisoned by the poison oak

			14th Septem {1849/09/14}
Friday  At 2 PM we put the two ox teams before one of the wagons thinking to go through to Fosters Bar with one wagon at a time  
I and five other men of our company went on with the teamsters  We Traveled 4 miles and encamped for the night,  the 5 men that went on with me war these  
Capt Joseph Case, John H. Green, Charles N Green, Daniel Glover, and George Herrick.  This afternoon Charles N Green was taken sick on the road,  at night I gave him an Emetick which seemed to help him very much  
This night the ciotes ware howling all around us  a great deal more so than I have ever known them  
They are an Animal betwixt a Woolf and a Fox smaller rather than a Fox but very Timed

			15th Septem {1849/09/15}
Saturday  At 7 in the morning we started again on our Journey and Traveled 6 miles over a very rough road and came to a small plain and stream of poor water that I call Cedar[?] crick  Some grass for the Teams  we set our Tent up for the day,  We are now 10 miles in advance of the mule teams, which ware left in charge of Capt David Hand one of our Trustees (and a Faithful one too)  Our teamsters concluded to return with the oxen and bring the other wagon up to this place before going ahead any farther,  We now are about 10 miles from Fosters Bar but the Road much worse than any

			1849 15th Septem Continued {1849/09/15}
than any that we have traveled so much so that it is almost impossible for a wagon to cross these mountains  
We have so many of our company sick that I see very plainly that we cannot cross these mountains with them  they cannot travel on foot nor can the mules draw them over the mountains, and I am fully convinced by what I have been informed by others and what I have observed myself that we cannot remain and work togeather as a company so as to make the Business profitable to any for there are some in the camp at sacrimento city that are as able to go into the mines as those that did go, and these that are with us will not be willing to share their earnings with those that are in the camp,  And if Capt Hand and myself should be taken sick and not able to attend to business I dont know what would become of them or the property that we have got with us,  Albert Jagger an other of our Trustees is with us but he does not take any Interest in getting a head with the wagon but will walk on for miles ahead of the teams, for the sake getting water to drink and leave us to tug over the mountains with the wagons and Baggage.  He says that self preservation comes first,  prehaps he is right but when we are not in much danger of perishing and there is work to be done that we are all equaly interested in I want to see every man to do his Duty that is able  
After pitching our tent I wrote a Letter to Capt Hand and those that we left behind advising them to send all the sick men back to sacrmento city by the emty wagons that ware returning that way  I stated to them that the roads ware very bad and if they thought best prehaps it would be as well for them all to return but to do as they thought  proper but if they did return I should endeavor to go through with the ox teams and dispose of the provisions and then meet  them at sacrimento city and there take a vote of the company to decide whethe we remain to geather any longer as a company

			1849 15th Septem Continued {1849/09/15}
I likewise advised them to release the half shares men from their agreement with us if they concluded to all return,  The teamsters drove their teams back and Daniel B. Glover returned to them on my Horse with my Letter,  We are now 10 miles from them and 10 miles from Fosters Bar our place of destination
			16th September
Sunday,  We made no move this day,  There is another wagon with 5 men that have been in company with us for some days  one of their number is a Babtist Clergyman from Mobil  he appears to be a very fine man,  his Tent was say 100 rods from ours,  he and an other of this company got their Pistols out and went to shooting at a mark,  I walke over to see them for a while but said nothing to them respecting the sabbath,  some of their men had gon down to the river about 4 miles from us to see if they could find gold  2 of our men was with them,  The Clergyman went out a shooting in the afternoon,  The men returned from the river some time before night, and reported there was gold there and that there some miners at that place,  The Priest at this time was at my Tent  he says to the men why did you not go to work and get some gold  their reply was that  the miners did not work on sunday  the Priest says why this is not sunday it is saturday  no said I it is the sabbath and you Mr have been shooting and setting us a fine example  It was some time before I could convince him that I was right  I told him that I kept a Journal  he said that all their men thought that it was saturday  He appeared very much hurt to think that he had broaken the sabbath in the manner that he had  he said to me why did you not tell me  I told him that I thought that he knew what day it was  he said no nor would I have done what I have knowingly for all the gold in California
He informed me that he charge of two churches one of them (African) at 1200 Dolls per year but came out hear for his Health

Sunday  At 6 PM Daniel B Glover returned from the camp whare we left the sick men  he says that after reading my letter they came to the conclusion to return to sacrimento and well pleased with it  Two of the company however came on with him thinking to go through to the Bar viz John Van Vechten and Edwin Isham, and five of our half shares men came on to go to work on their own hook viz Watson Coney  Franklin C Jessup, Daniel Howell, Perres Conce, and Charles Crook, Charles N Green is quite sick 

			17th Septem {1849/09/16}
Monday  The teams returned with the other wagon from the sick camp.  Capt Hand has informed me that there ware 23 sick men in the camp at the the time and hardly well men enough to take care of the sick,  George Post is very dangerous sick  they think that he has been sun struck 
We lay by this day to let the Teams feed for there is some grass in this place but none to be had at the bar,  This day I and some others went down to the river about 4 miles to the place whare the men went yesterday to see if we could find gold  we worked for about 4 hours by washing the sand with our Tin-Pans and we got a little gold,  This is called Fosters Old Bar,  there ware a few men at work at this place with their cradles, but I think they ware not doing much,  The countery is very mountanious and well wooded,  some of the trees very large

			18th September{1849/09/18}
Tuesday  The teamsters started this morning with one of the wagons with both teams say six yoak of oxen to go through to the Bar  they drove on till night and stoped 3 miles short of the Bar  nothing for the cattle to feed on,  myself and John Van Vechten ware each on horse back  we went through to the Bar and I found aquaintances (viz Mr Sutter and a Mr Renalds) who entertained us by giving us a very good supper and Lodgings for the night, but our poor horses got only a quart of wheat each there being no grass in the place nor Oats or Barley to be bought

Messr Sutter and Renalds saile from Sag Harbor in the schooner            They inform me that they have enjoyed very good health have not been sick a day since they have been in this countery and that they are averaging Forty Dollars a pice pr Day at mining,  The 5 men of the half shares men that came on arived at this place and got a clame of an other man and are going to work, and I think that our company would have done very well at this place had it not have been for the sicknes that we had on the road,  There is some sickness among the miners at this place

			19th Septemb {1849/09/19}
Wednesday  This morning at about 8 o clock our wagon came in with the load of provisions  I coul make with no sale of the provisions so I made an agreement with Capt Joseph Case & Edwin Isham to sell the provisions to the best advantage for the company boath this load and the other that is to arive, and I gave these 5 men the privilage to stay and work for themselves and not go back to attend our meeting but it was necessary for me to return, with the understanding that they should take care of the property and sell it for the company  These are the men Joseph Case  Edwin Isham  John Van Vechten  George Herrick and Daniel B Glover,  The teamsters cut down some oak Trees for the oxen to feed on the leaves,  that is all they can do for them,  The 5 men last named has given me a written powe attorney to vote and act for them at the coming meeting.  I went this morning into their claim  they gave me a pan full of dirt  I washed it out and got some gold,  Van Vechten and I bought some Indian meal at 75 cents per pound for our Horses but they would not eat it  The ox teams started on their return at 9 AM they have a very bad mountain to assend immediately on leaving Fosters Bar  it is as much as 6 yoak of oxen can do to pull an emty wagon up,  at 10 AM Van Vechten and I left with our Horses and we ware one hour leading them up the first mountain,  We got back to the other wagon at 6 PM  ox teams a little a head of us

Thursday  We lay by all of this day that the cattle might feed for they have had scarsely anything for thes two days past,  Those mountains are well wooded with some of the Largest Pine and Cedar Trees that I ever saw,  some of the Pines will measure from 5 to 6 feet Diameter and will stand 150 to 200 feet and as straight as an arrow for 70 or 80 feet before you see a limb and the cedars are some of them very large  These large trees ware within10 miles of Fosters Bar and from the Yuba river I know not how fair west  The farther north we go the larger the Timber  I have not seen any good oak timber in california  the Trees are old and very brash or porous and brittle  John and Charles Green are boath sick this day  Charles is very sick

Friday  This morning the teamsters got ready to go over the mountains with the other wagon,  we took off the mining tools and sent nothing but provisions about half a load  They prefer to take the tools back to sacrimento rather than to take them over the mountains  There being no sale for them at the Bar, we have consumed a good deal of our provisions on the road for the 14 Days that we have been Journing and we have to keep enough to take us back to sacrimento  we have likewise sold provisions and utensils to the amount of $182.95  
A sick man came to my Tent and wanted an Emetic  I had none for him but recommended a dose of Calomet & Jallap which he took and insisted on my taking 6 dollars in gold Dust for it.  he said that he would have to pay a Doctor more than that for it  I finaly took it the Dust and gave the company credit for the same  The Men with the Team and the other men that belong to the company started for the bar at 5 AM Leaving myself and John H Green and Charles N Green in our Tent to await the return of the wagon  John and Charles boath sick  Charles rather better than he was yesterday but John not as well  They have chills and Fever

Saturday  At about noon the Team returned from Fosters Bar  Edwin Isham sent me by one of the Teamsters $307.50 the amount of provisions that he had sold to that time  This and the above amount I have given the company credit for,  we must let the Teams feed this afternoon and night so that we shall be able to start on our return in the morning,  John and Charles remain much the same as yesterday,  From yesterday morning up to to Day noon I was all alone with them, but now I have the company of the Teamsters and two other men that are going to take passage down with us,  We are now about 90 miles from sacrimento city and 10 miles from Fosters Bar,  We have been informed by Travelers that Capt Hand had got the sick men on wagons and they all with the mule teams had started on their return about 3 Days ago

			23rd September {1849/09/23}
Sunday  This morning I find myself quite unwell, But have made up our minds to start  on our return to our camp at sacrimento city and to take a passage in the ox wagons I have agreed to pay the Teamsters Fifteen Dollars for the passage of myself John and Charles  The other two men they are strangers they pay 12 Dollars Each,  we have some mining tools say about 400 pounds weight to take back and 5 Cradles  but the Cradles I concluded to leave with one Mr Dolson for him to dispose of and to pay the money over to the men that are at work in the mines, and on there return he paid it to Van Vechten
at 8 AM we started on our return  myself John and Charles sick and all three in one wagon Exposed to a very hot sun for these wagons have no tops to them to keep the sun off,  We took the same Road back that that we came on and Traveled much faster than we did in coming out.  The wagons being much lighter, we lay in the hot sun through the Day for the first day but on the second day they cut some sticks set them up on the wagons and spread a Blanket on them which made a shade for us but & the Dust the Dust the Dust that beets all

We continued on our jurney with out meeting with any thing curious  we sometimes sleeping in the wagon and some times on the ground, but all three of quite sick,  We Traveled on in this way with the two strangers with us who rendered us all the assistance in their power Especially a Capt Davis who said that he was from the state of Mane  He had some cans of preserved soups which he did prepair and give to us while we made a stop on the road

Wednesday  At about 5 PM we arrived in our camp at sacrimento city,  we found a number of our company very sick,  I was informed of the death of George Post who died on Monday 24th inst,  He was Buried at Sutters Fort, distant about two miles from our Camp

			27th September {1849/09/27}
Thursday  We are all of us in camp some very sick myself for one  John H Green is better so that he is about  Charles N Green is much the same as he has been for some days past
We remained in the camp this way untill the First of October

			1st October {1849/10/01}
Monday  on this day we called the company togeather (or all the members that are with us at this place) and held a meeting to decide whither we remain togeather as a company any longer or Break Up and every man go for himself,  This thing having been in agitation for some time past they ware all prepaired for the question,  There was a vote taken by Ballot on the Question and found to be allmost unanimous in favor of a Dissolution and Braking Up of the company,  Now Capt Wm C Hanes at one of our company meeting requested me to put the same question that we have now put  I declined doing by saying that we had not made any trial as yet as to know whither we could remain and work togeather or not and he said no more about it in my hearing  Some of those men that left the company before we went out for the mines told me that the

[end of page log754_068.gif]

greater part of the members would vote one wy and that they would talk an other way, and the reason of their leaving the company was that they knew that they would not hold together and that they had repeatedly heard them say so,  They told me that the longer that we remained togeather the worse it would be for all concerned, which I soon found to be the case  
The next Business to be done at this meeting to be done was to appoint two Agents to close the conserns of the company  they ware to be allowed 125 dollars per month each and Board found them and 6 months time allowed them to do it in,  Capt D. Hand mentioned to the meeting that Henry Green with an other man would do the business for less than one Hundred Dollars each  Charles Howell the Presiding Elder of the meeting replyed to Capt Hand by stamping his foot on the ground and saying that (he or we) would have the business closed up if it cost 500 Dollars per month,  The fact is that it was a strife betwixt church and state caused one mans being elected and the Elder not at the reelection of our Trustees some time ago  
He has felt very sore about it  from that time  
The vote was finaly taken by Ballot  all the sick in the Tents sending out their ballots which was as it aught to be  The votes ware counted and was found that Alfred H Sandford and Albert Gaggen had        votes  Henry Green and Capt James Parker had only 17 votes,  The Elder and his men had been Electioneering for some days past so that we see that church or the cloak more properly speeking has succeeded  I remonstrated with them and told them the company that 6 months was too long a time and requeste that it might be 2-1/2 or 3 months but there was no notice taken of it  I being sick and very febel at the time retired to my Tent and lay down not knowing that they had any other business to transact at the meeting for I had not been consulted with but it appears that they wen on and voted that

			1st October 1849  {1849/10/01}
Each member can draw provisions &c to the amount of 75 Dollars on a share but the sustitutes ware not alowed that privelage and from this date I take it that the shares that the substitutes came out on are not represented by any one,  The vote on the 75 Dollar question was carried by holding up the hand so that we that ware in our tents sick lost our vote by its not being done by ballot,  They pretend to say that it was voted that the members of the company could have the 75 Dollars worth at cost adding 25 per cent but there is no record of any such vote on the Book  The Agents elected had no instructions whatever from their constituents how to dispose of the property whither to sell for cash or credit or how they should dispose of the Funds,  But they are Church men,  I hope that they will do what is right, At any rate they will make a good winters work for them selves  Four Dollars per day and their Board found them, and for what.  I think that there will be about a much business for some one to do after the first of April as there was on the first of October, the time that they went into office, for I think that it would have been a very dificult thing to pick out two men of less Knowledge in maters and things especialy in anything belonging to a ship but they are churchmen,  see what Albert Jagger as a Trustee was good for on our way to Fosters Bar whare he says that self preservation comes first and leaves Capt Hand and me to get along as we can  but he is a churchman and now is to receve his reward by being paid 4 Dollars per Day for 6 months and Alfred H Sandford an other Trustees who sat upon his... in the camp all the while that Capt Hand and myself ware doing our best to keep our company togeather and get them through to the mines  now any man can see at one the Impossibility of our keeping togeather and working as a company,  I think that if we would all of us pull one way we might do well very well as 

[end of page log754_070.gif]

company but as it is the best thing that we could do was to break up and let them go to the... and get all the gold that they can
Now at one of our meetings before our starting for the mines from our camp at sacrimento city I being made aquainted in some measure with the state of things in the company, I having three shares of Extra stock in the company I made the company the offer of it at cost, so that they should not think that I was governed altogeather by self interest in endeavoring to keep the company togeather  They did not accept my offer  I said to the members of the company at different times that if the company kept togeather I wanted nothing more from them than what I agreed for But if they should break up I should demand wagers or Pay for Navigating the ship out and I belive that it was circulated among them and well understood by them all that would be the case, and since what has transpired I think that I shall demand pay from them at the rate of 100 Dollars per month for many reasons that I can give.  
In the first place when we ware at sea one month my two mates pay was raised from one Dollar per month to 25 Dollars which thing was very right  There ware at that time four men of our company that that went on Duty as seamen at 14 Dollars per month and it was agreed that all the mechanicks who worked should have 12-1/2 cents per hour for all the time that they worked,  Now I was on deck all day from morning till night attending to all the business that was being done as the navigating of the ship, while others ware sitting below a Reading or playing games for passtime  
There was no time to play or even to read through the day  I attende to my duty boath by day and by night,  now I am taxed for all these expences and why not I receive a compencation as well as others for my services  the ship arived in safety and without any misshap

[end of page log754_071.gif]

These Agents that ware appointed the other day are to receive Fifteen Hundred Dollars for what, I cannot tell for my part not only the above sum but they are to live on the company provisions which if added to the above sum will make it Eighteen Hundred and sixty five Dollars,  now they are to be paid by some one for their services whither real or imaginary and if my interest in the company pays its proportion it will be at the rate of $29.60 per month  Now at the time that I agreed to navigate the ship to California at the nominal sum of one Dollar per month, we had a constitution and by that constitution ware bound to geather for the term of two years to work at mining and Trading with many privelages to Each Member,  had it not been so and I the greatest stock holder in the company I shoul not have shipped as I did  
Now the company is Broaken Up and the constitution become a Dead Letter with all the prvilages and inducements that it contains  Now every man is paid for what he does and I am taxed for all this,  why not I be paid for the many and well known services I have done the company  at any rate I shall inquire into it, and if there is any Law in California I am determined to find out whither agents can be appointed (after the company has broaken up) to Dispose of my property at Three or Four hundred per cent  less than it will fetch in the market and this to be done in open defiance of my remonstrance against such proceedings
Capt James Parker, Capt John Woodward, Capt Barney R Green, Capt Wm C Hanes, Capt Edward W Halsey and Thomas P Ripley did not attend this meeting  they being at the ship at the time

Rain very often  we understand that thare has been so much Rain that the traveling to the mines has become very bad so that it is allmost imposible for the wagons and Teams to get along and many of them are stuck fast in the mud and the teams knocked in the head on the spot for they must perish if they ware not killed  This California soil is the worst when wet that I ever saw,  it is like a Bed of morter
