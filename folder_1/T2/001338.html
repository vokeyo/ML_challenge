<p><strong>Statement of Critical Regional or State Water Problems:</strong></p>
    <p>There is an ongoing effort by both federal and state agencies 
      to better understand the effects of elevated nutrients and their associated 
      environmental impacts. Currently, 
      the US Environmental Protection Agency in conjunction with State agencies 
      are working to establish nutrient criteria for rivers and streams throughout 
      the United States. It is crucial 
      to have effective tools to accurately assess the environmental impacts of 
      these anthropogenic nutrient loads, and to predict environmental trends 
      produced by the continued growth in our population. Agriculture in Maryland’s Coastal Plain results 
      in elevated levels of phosphorus and nitrogen in running waters that eventually 
      impact the Chesapeake Bay. Best 
      management practices have been implemented in agricultural productions throughout 
      Maryland to abate some of the problems associated with non-point source 
      pollution and its effect on the State’s surface and ground water supplies. In particular, no-till agriculture has reduced much of the erosion 
      problem and helped to reduce the amount of irrigation necessary in the crop 
      fields. Timed fertilizer applications and better understanding of nutrient 
      utilization by crops has reduced the excessive fertilizer loadings on fields. Although these practices have assisted in reducing some of the contaminant 
      loads to the stream, certain contaminants continue to appear in both the 
      surface water and groundwater. Of particular interest is the phosphorus flux 
      into the stream from the watershed.</p>
	  
    <p>Over the past year, stream samples collected by us from 
      the Nassawango Creek on the Eastern Shore of Maryland have illustrated elevated 
      phosphorus levels and occasionally increased nitrate-nitrogen levels. Baseline data collected on both this watershed 
      and a more pristine stream in southern Maryland, the Nanjemoy Creek, indicate 
      very different nutrient loads and differing benthic communities. A better understanding of the effects of phosphorus 
      loading in streams can be gained be studying these two stream systems in 
      concert. This project will assess 
      how functional measurements, like organic material processing, is effected 
      by elevated nutrient levels and compare these findings to established structural 
      biotic community tools already in practice. This information can provide a better understanding 
      of the Coastal Plain areas of Maryland where heavy agricultural practices 
      and chicken rearing productions contribute to the potential non-point source 
      loadings of the watershed.</p>
	  
    <p><strong>Statement of Results or Benefits:</strong></p>
	
    <p>The expected results of this project 
      will be a better understanding of the cause-effect relationships between 
      elevated nutrient levels and the organic material breakdown capability of 
      a stream system. It will study the 
      interactions between the biotic community structure and its capacity to 
      function under different aquatic chemical conditions. Elevated nutrients, with 
	  specific emphasis on phosphorus, will be 
      the focal point of the studies. The 
      project will develop a preliminary stream assessment tool based on functional 
      responses with an analysis of its effectiveness in two watersheds. In addition, comparison of this new approach 
      to established tools already in use will be completed. The work done in this study can be used to 
      construct a better assessment tool for biological monitoring and classifying 
      the impacts on stream systems. Knowledge 
      of how the biotic community processes organic materials under elevated nutrient 
      conditions will provide another dimension of understanding, and will increase 
      the variety and number of tools available for State and local agencies making 
      resource management decisions.</p>
	  
    <p>Another potential benefit is that this study may provide 
      additional information on the coastal plain region of Maryland. This new data will contribute to both the Maryland 
      Department of Natural Resources database for these streams, as well as the 
      United States Environmental Protection Agencies (US EPA) National Nutrient 
      Strategy. The US EPA is in the process 
      of establishing region specific nutrient criteria for rivers and streams 
      (US EPA 1998). Augmenting the available 
      databases will improve the understanding about the specific stream conditions 
      for each of the different regions.</p>
    
<p><strong>Nature, Scope, and Objectives:</strong></p>
    <p>Agriculture in Maryland’s Coastal 
      Plain results in elevated levels of phosphorus and nitrogen in running waters 
      that eventually impact the Chesapeake Bay. Procedures for measuring the impact of nutrients on stream ecosystems 
      have emphasized structural assessment tools, such as species diversity, 
      taxa richness, or the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) index. Here, we propose one-year study to determine 
      the utility of functional assessment tools (e.g., metrics representing leaf 
      decomposition rates) as measures of ecosystem integrity.</p>
	  
    <p>The objectives of this project 
      are:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>1. To 
        measure leaf decomposition in coastal plain streams in agricultural and 
    non-agricultural regions in Maryland;</p>
    
    <p>2. To compare leaf decomposition rates to structural 
    indices of water quality; and</p>
	  
    <p>3. To measure the functional response of stream 
      biota to the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen.</p>
  </blockquote>

    <p>There are several structural tools already in use that classify 
            a water system based on chemical analyses, the abundance and diversity of 
            biological organisms, and physical characteristics of the river or stream. In the past, water quality tests depended primarily on chemical assessments 
            to characterize lotic systems. There are two distinct advantages to this method: 
            1) chemical analyses reflect point source contamination problems, and 2) 
            they provide highly quantitative regulatory levels for agencies to monitor. However, in recent years there has been a growing trend to use biological 
            monitoring techniques due to their greater sensitivity to a wide range of 
      pollutants and their early warning capabilities.</p>
	  
    <p>Rosenberg and Resh (1993) provide a detailed description 
            and evaluation of the utility of biological monitoring methods, with particular 
            attention given to methods based on sampling benthic macroinvertebrates. Unlike chemical data, which provides water 
            quality information at a discrete point in time, biological organisms are 
            long-term integrators of environmental stresses. Different species of organisms exhibit a range of responses to environmental 
            impacts. Macroinvertebrates in particular 
            provide a very good indicator tool of environmental degradation. They are widespread and are relatively sessile in their aquatic phase, 
            and can be inexpensively sampled. These 
            organisms can be used for laboratory studies, including toxicological, physiological, 
            behavioral, or functional assessments, in order to better understand a particular 
      contaminant’s effect (Rosenberg and Resh 1993).</p>
	  
    <p>The Maryland Department of Natural Resources has created 
            a region specific index of biological integrity to assess water quality 
            and potential impacts across the State of Maryland (Maryland Biological 
            Stream Survey 1997). The strength 
            of this technique is its combination of multiple metrics in order to develop 
            a greater picture of the stream or river condition (Karr and Chu 1999). The MBSS has also included a benthic macroinvertebrate 
            metric based on the Hilsenhoff’s biotic index to assist in rapid biological 
            assessments in aquatic systems (Hilsenhoff 1988). Both of these measurement tools provide a static 
            view of the aquatic conditions focusing on the structural components of 
            the system. The techniques utilize 
            the presence or absence of specific organisms as well as their relative 
      abundance to identify and classify the degradation in an aquatic environment.</p>
	  
    <p>Other measurable characteristics of streams that can increase 
            our understanding of environmental impacts may be found in the functions 
            or streams, such as nutrient processing. Such functions may be expected to change in predictable ways when 
            the stream is exposed to contaminants. Understanding how the biotic organisms process organic material, 
            for example, can expand our ability to assess impairments by measuring how 
            well the organisms are breaking down the materials in a given stream system. 
            The dynamic view of assessing the system function under impacted conditions 
            could conceivably become the most critical tool in managing the resource. At a minimum, the functional component will 
            provide a greater understanding of how to assess environmental degradation 
            of a stream or river. This approach 
            provides information on the production of the aquatic system (phytoplankton 
            and zooplankton), the processing of organic materials (the uptake of both 
            allochthonous and autochthonous materials), and the transportation of materials. For these reasons, we intend to develop this functional approach 
            to be used in concert with the structural methods currently used. The development of such assessment tools will provide the resource 
            manager with more comprehensive information regarding detrimental nutrient 
            levels, and will enhance the scientific information available for environmental 
      policy-makers.</p>
	  
    <p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
    <p>We propose a one year effort to develop a better assessment 
            tool for understanding of the fate and transport of agricultural nutrients 
            within the surface water. The study intends to link the effects of elevated 
      nutrients to changes in functional aspects of the stream system. 
	  It involves the following efforts:</p>
    <p><strong>A. </strong><u><strong>To measure leaf decomposition in streams representing 
      agricultural and non-agricultural regions in Maryland</strong></u></p>
    <p>Here, our objective is to test for variations in leaf pack 
            processing between sites within the same watershed, as well as between watersheds. We plan to perform both baseline chemical and physical tests as well 
            as field leaf decomposition studies for this investigation.<strong><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </strong>Monitoring of selected streams on the agricultural 
            impacted Eastern Shore and in the more pristine forested streams of southern 
            Maryland will help to identify chemical, physical, and structural differences 
            between the two environments. We 
            have collected water chemistry, benthic macroinvertebrate samples, and hydrologic 
            data over the past year on two different watersheds in Maryland: the Nassawango 
            Creek south of Salisbury and the Nanjemoy Creek in Southern Maryland. Table 1 illustrates the suite of physical and chemical parameters 
            regularly monitored at our field sites. These tests are performed on a monthly basis at 5 sample sites within 
      each stream system.</p>
    <p>The study sites on the Eastern Shore of Maryland have yielded 
            elevated phosphorus levels, on the order of 170-2750 ug PO<sub>4</sub>-P/L. These extremely high ambient conditions warrant 
            studies focused on the biotic community and their functional capacity under 
            an environmentally degraded scenario. The 
            study sites in Southern Maryland have not shown such high phosphorus levels, 
            20-940 ug PO<sub>4</sub>-P/L, and therefore can be used as a comparison. This baseline data will provide the foundation for our further investigation 
            into the effects of phosphorus on the stream system and the development 
      of potential monitoring tools.</p>
	  
    <p>Leaf decomposition studies will be performed in the field 
            to examine relationships between the stream phosphorus levels and the biotic 
            processing of the leaf matter. These 
            studies will be performed six times during the year. We plan to use tube traps containing 2.5 grams of desiccated red 
            maple leaves. The tube traps will 
            be constructed of PVC tubing with a coarse holes on the upstream side to 
            allow macroinvertebrate entry and fine mesh on the downstream end to prevent 
            leaf matter loss. The tube traps 
            will be secured to bricks and placed on the stream bottom. There will be 8 replicates at each site. The traps will be collected after 21 days to 
            process. The leaves will then be 
            rinsed. After sample dry weights 
            will be measured, followed by the samples being ashed using a muffle furnace. We will calculate the proportion of organic 
            matter decomposed using these weights and compare these values to pre-determined 
            organic matter proportions for maple leaves. This comparison will provide the percentage 
            organic matter loss due to decomposition within the stream environment. These field trials coupled with the monitoring 
      data may illustrate other potential factors influencing the stream function.</p>
	  
    <p><strong>B. <u>To compare leaf decomposition rates to structural indices 
      of water quality</u></strong></p>
	  
    <p>The objective is to compare structural and functional indices 
            in order to assess the effectiveness of a new environmental stress indicator. The first step is to gather structural information on the two watersheds. We use artificial leaf packs to collect the macroinvertebrates six 
            time within the year. Five grams 
            of desiccated red maple leaves are bound to a brick and left in the stream 
            for 30 days. We use 8 replicate 
            leaf samples at each site. These 
            leaves are then collected from the field and preserved at 4<sup>o</sup> 
      Celsius until processed. The leaves 
            are rinsed in a pan and the macroinvertebrates are trapped by filtering 
            the water through a 425 micrometer mesh size sieve. Each sample is then labeled and preserved in Kahle’s solution. The macroinvertebrates are then identified to genus level. Number of taxa, number of individuals, and 
            various other community indices [e.g., the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera 
            (EPT) index] will be calculated. This 
            data will assist in defining the community structure present as well as 
            provide information as to which organism could best be used in laboratory 
      bioassays.</p>
	  
    <p>Regression analysis will then be performed to assess the 
            differences between the structural and functional measurements. The monthly sampling will continue to provide 
            a longitudinal database that will then be analyzed to compare the decomposition 
            results with the expected structural classification of the stream. This comparison will be based on established models, such as the 
            Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). The State of Maryland has established regional specific metrics to 
            assess the stream conditions in the different ecoregions within the State 
            (Maryland Department of Natural Resources 1998). The MBSS will provide a good comparison tool to use with these decomposition 
            trials (Maryland Department of Natural Resources 1997). The two different methods of classification will then be compared 
      using multivariate statistics.</p>
	  
    <p><strong>C. <u>To measure the functional response of stream 
      biota to the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen</u></strong></p>
	  
    <p>The objective is to identify the effects of varied nutrient 
            concentrations, both phosphorus and nitrogen, on the different biological 
            trophic levels, as well as the effects on the decomposition of the allochthonous 
            leaf matter. This will be accomplished 
            by constructing artificial stream environments and subjecting known organisms 
            to different nutrient enrichment levels. The artificial stream environment consists 
            of 200 ml of natural stream water, collected immediately before each test, 
            in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a glass tube to supply air under 
            pressure. The air maintains a water 
            current and high oxygen levels comparable to a riffle area of a natural 
            stream. Effects of elevated nutrients will be tested 
            using bacteria and macroinvertebrates. Both of these organisms use the leaf material as a food source. We plan to use<i> Pycnopsyche sp.</i>(Trichoptera: Limnephilidae) for the macroinvertebrate 
            toxicology tests to assess nutrient effects on primary production. Pycnopsyche 
            sp. was selected as an appropriate test species due to its presence in the 
            Nanjemoy Creek as well as its functional feeding. It is a shredding macroinvertebrate which breaks 
            down the course particulate organic matter (CPOM) to fine particulate organic 
            matter (FPOM). This processing of 
            organic matter leads to further decomposition by microbial consumers (Hauer 
      and Lamberti 1996).</p>
	  
    <p>Three experiments will be conducted with <i>Pycnopsyche sp.</i> and bacteria present and 
            then it will be repeated with only the bacteria present. For each, at least four treatments with six 
            replicates will be established with a control, a high, a medium, and a low 
            concentration of nutrients. The 
            water will be spiked with either phosphorus or nitrogen and then with both. Before and after each test red maple leaf discs 
            will be weighed and leaf area determined by a CI-400 CIAS system (CID, Inc.). Leaf discs will also be ashed to determine leaf decomposition rates. Bacterial respiration will be measured using a respirometer to assess 
            their activity level and any potential toxicological effects. Laboratory 
            trials will assist in honing in on individual parameters and their corresponding 
            toxicological effects. Understanding 
            how these organisms are affected by different nutrient concentrations will 
            provide insight into the functional capacity of the stream system. These experiments will be analyzed using ANOVA and regression analysis. Lastly, continued monthly monitoring of the stream water chemistry 
            and hydrologic parameters coupled with laboratory bioassays will help to 
            delineate how elevated nutrients effect the stream system. Multivariate 
            analyses (e.g., principle components, factor analysis) will be conducted 
      to relate decomposition rates to physical, and chemical conditions.</p>

    <p>Presently, two watersheds have been selected as field 
            study sites. Each of these sites 
            is located on Nature Conservancy lands with readily available access. There is a US Geological Survey stream gauging 
            station located at one of the Nassawango Creek sample sites. This enables us to extend our hydrologic database 
            beyond our sample dates in order to better assess the hydrologic impacts 
      on the nutrient loading.</p>
	  
    <p>The University of Maryland Department of Entomology has 
            excellent research facilities for conducting the proposed research. Dr. Lamp’s laboratory facilities are equipped 
            for field experiments as well as laboratory stream simulations with benthic 
            macroinvertebrates, algae, and bacteria. There are dissection microscopes, stream biotic samplers, rearing 
            cages, microbalances, muffle furnace, and Percival growth chambers which 
            will assist in the aquatic insect studies. Also, the lab is equipped with analytical instrumentation for studying 
            water chemistry parameters. Field 
            tools to assess both the water chemistry and hydrologic parameters, such 
            as discharge are also available. The 
            Department has both shared and personal computer facilities for data management 
            and statistical analysis and internet access to the USGS gauging station 
      database.</p>
	  
    <p><strong>Related Research</strong></p>
    <p>There have been multiple studies performed in the 
            past focusing on leaf decomposition and the detrital food web (Cummins et 
            al. 1973, Elwood et al. 1981, Howarth et al. 1976, Mullholland et al. 1985, 
            Newbold et al. 1983, Petersen and Cummins 1974, Suberkropp et al. 1976, 
            and Triska and Sedell 1976). Several 
            of these studies illustrate the relationship of how different biotic trophic 
            levels play a crucial role in the decomposition process. Particular attention is focused on the bacteria and their role in 
            the utilization of the organic matter within the stream (Fuss and Smock 
            1996, Kaplan and Bott 1983, Koetsier et al. 1997, and Suberkropp and Klug 
            1976). The macroinvertebrate’s role in the breakdown 
            of allochthonous materials is illustrated in several experiments (Mulholland 
            et al. 1985, Mulholland et al. 1983, and Cummins et al. 1979). Many of these efforts have tried to explain 
            a part of the stream’s ability to cycle nutrients through the decomposition 
            and utilization of both leaf matter and the uptake by primary producers, 
      bacteria and benthic macroinvertebrates.</p>
	  
    <p>One of the studies in particular assessed primary production, 
            bacterial activity, and leaf decomposition by macroinvertebrates (Elwood 
            et al. 1981). They observed that 
            streams with artificially elevated phosphorus levels (up to 450 ug PO4-P/L) 
            had increased nitrogen and phosphorus levels in leaf packs, increased respiration 
            rates of leaf discs, and increased mass loss of leaves. In addition, the algal biomass was augmented 
            by the increased phosphorus inputs. These 
            findings suggest that the increase in phosphorus influences both the primary 
            and secondary trophic levels in the aquatic food web (Elwood et al. 1981). However, another study illustrated that it was a combination of nitrogen 
            and phosphorus that caused some of these changes in processing (Howarth 
      et al. 1976).</p>
    <p>This project can help to elucidate these discrepancies 
            by testing both the structural and functional approaches. In addition, previous studies looked at artificial 
            stream systems and nutrient spiked streams to assess elevated phosphorus 
            effects. Our project will be able 
            to provide additional information in three areas. First, the Eastern Shore study sites have elevated 
            phosphorus at approximately one and one half orders of magnitude higher 
            than those spiked in Elwood’s 1981 study. These sites will help to field test some of the conclusions found 
            in previous works. Second, this 
            information will be specific to the coastal plains environment of Maryland 
            as opposed to the upland area studies previously mentioned. Last, evaluating nutrient effects and limitations 
            specific to a region will serve to better understand the functional processes 
      of coastal plain streams.</p>
    <p>This project will compare the functional 
            measurements with the current indices in use. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) 
            provides a region-specific database, which can be used as one of the structural 
            comparisons. The MBSS was conducted 
            State-wide and a number of reference sites selected under this program will 
            give a good points of contrast with our agriculturally impacted sites (Maryland 
            Biological Stream Survey 1997). The 
            survey incorporates Hilsenhoff’s rapid biological assessment. Hilsenhoff (1988) bases his assessment tool 
            on families of benthic macroinvertebrates and their relative tolerance of 
            organic pollution. Karr and Chu 
            (1999) suggest expanding the scope of the biological monitoring methods 
            by incorporating several metrics that together provide a greater picture 
            of the stream. The metrics may include 
            identifying taxa richness, functional feeding group, population attributes, 
            and tolerance levels (Karr and Chu 1999). The use of functional feeding 
            groups introduces the use of function as a measure of impact. Our intention is to develop a new metric that 
            can provide additional information on the stream condition based on the 
            biological functioning capacity. This 
            tool could then provide another dimension to the biological assessment, 
            and more importantly, it may provide a more sensitive gauge for understanding 
      nutrient impacts in lotic systems.</p>
    <p>Several investigations exist on the effects of elevated 
            nutrients on the stream ecosystem. There 
            have been many studies using different organisms to test contaminant adverse 
            effects of contaminants. Prior to 
            evaluating the adverse impacts, it is necessary to understand the role and 
            function of organisms in the stream. Allan (1995) provides a detailed description of the different trophic 
            levels within the lotic system. He 
            illustrates the complexity of the utilization of organic material. Central to all of the organisms is the link to organic matter and 
            the need to obtain nutrients for energy, growth, and development. We can draw on the results of other studies to provide a basis of 
            understanding of what components affect the nutrient processing in the stream. For example, Richey et al. (1985) showed the 
            effect of primary producers on the nitrogen cycling in the stream. This cycling of nitrogen downstream was influenced 
            by the uptake on the nutrients. In 
            another study, McDougal et al. (1997) illustrated that nutrient enrichment 
            can cause community structure shifts. Further investigation may help to clearly illustrate whether the 
            uptake and processing of material is also altered. Kjeldsen (1996) illustrated the strong link between the primary 
            producers, algae, and their regulation due to invertebrate grazing, phosphorus 
            concentrations, and irradiance. Phosphorus 
            was not found to be a significant controlling mechanism in the primary producers 
            productivity. These field studies 
            provide a basis from which we can build upon in establishing a greater understanding 
            of primary producers’ response to phosphorus. There are community level toxicity methods using primary producers 
            that can aid in our effort to understand nutrient enrichment consequences 
            (Blanck 1985). Our studies will be at considerably higher 
            levels of phosphorus than was previously tested, which can then be used 
            to evaluate ambient conditions currently found on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.</p>
    <p>Other studies illustrate the processing roles of such 
            organisms as macroinvertebrates and bacteria the stream function (Allan 
            1995, Fisher et al. 1973, Grimm et al. 1985, Cummins et al. 1973, Wallace 
            et al. 1982, and Petersen et al. 1974). Mulholland et al. 
			(1983, 1985) illustrated that the community structure could alter the 
            phosphorus spiralling length within a stream. Other authors suggest that the processing 
			function of the stream 
            is dependent not only on the organisms utilizing the nutrients but also 
            on the physical characteristics (retention) of the stream (Newbold et al. 
            1982). They concluded that additional information 
            is needed to understand nutrient transport and the effects on stream function 
            and structure. Although they designed 
            models to predict the effects of organisms individually on the spiraling 
            distance on nutrients, the effects of the entire community as a whole were 
            not considered. We intend to further 
            previous research by investigating what organisms are present in the stream 
            systems, and how they are contributing to the organic processing cycle under 
            high phosphorus conditions. With 
            this information we hope to build an effective assessment tool that can 
            identify the functional capacity of the system to decompose leaf matter 
      under phosphorus rich conditions.</p>
