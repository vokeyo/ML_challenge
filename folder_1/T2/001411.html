<P>This coastal glossary includes terminology used in coastal science,
engineering, geology, management, nearshore oceanography and the technologies
that characterize, measure, describe or quantify the physical properties,
processes and changes of the coastal zone. Numerous potential selections were
omitted at the discretion of the compilers. Correspondence noting errors,
omissions or containing suggestions are welcomed in anticipation of future
editions of this glossary. Please send all comments to Brian Voigt, Coastal
Monitoring &amp; Analysis Program, Department of Ecology, PO Box 47600,
Olympia, WA 98504-7600, 360.407.6568, email bvoi461@ecy.wa.gov.</P>
<P>Definitions are listed in alphabetical order and consist of the definition
and descriptive terms. Many words feature multiple definitions. These
definitions are listed in numerical order (1), (2), (3), etc. Terms defined by
the Washington State Department of Ecology&#146;s Shoreline Master Program
(SMP) Handbook 1994 edition are prefaced by the (SMP) designation. In addition,
some SMP definitions reference RCW numbers, the Revised Code of Washington.
Cross-referencing of terms included in the glossary is denoted by words typed
in all capitals. For example, abrasion is defined as the frictional EROSION by
material transported by wind and waves. Cross-referencing of both EROSION and
WAVES is found within this definition.</P>
<P>The text also includes figures that reference defined terms. These figures
are located in Appendix A.</P>

Tides are sometimes classified as DIURNAL, SEMIDIURNAL and MIXED, but there are
no sharply defined limits separating the groups. The tide is said to be DIURNAL
when the diurnal wave predominated and only a single high and single LOW WATER
occur each day during the greater part of the month. The tide is SEMIDIURNAL
when the semidiurnal wave predominates and two high and two low waters occur
each tidal day with a relatively small inequality in the high and LOW WATER
heights. In the MIXED type of tide the DIURNAL and semidiurnal waves are both
important factors and the tide is characterized by large inequality in the high
or LOW WATER heights or in both. There will usually be two high and two low
waters each day, but occasionally the tide will become DIURNAL. See Figure 11.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unconformity: A surface that represents a break in the
geologic record, with the rock unit immediately above it being considerably
younger than the rock beneath. There are three major aspects to consider: (1)
Time. An <I>unconformity</I> develops during a period of time in which no
sediment is deposited. This concept equates deposition and time, and an
<I>unconformity</I> represents unrecorded time. (2) Deposition. Any
interruption of deposition, whether large or small in extent, is an
<I>unconformity</I>. This aspect of <I>unconformity</I> pre-supposes a standard
&#145;scale&#146; of deposition which is complete. Major breaks in
sedimentation can usually be demonstrated easily, but minor breaks may go
unrecorded until highly detailed investigations are made. (3) Structure.
Structurally, <I>unconformity</I> may be regarded as planar structures
separating older rocks below from younger rocks above, representing the
&#145;break&#146; as defined in (1) and (2) above. A plane of
<I>unconformity</I> may be a surface of weathering, EROSION or denudation, or a
surface of non-deposition, or possibly some combination of these factors. It
may be parallel to the upper strata, make an angle with the upper strata, or be
irregular. Subsequent Earth movements may have folded or faulted it.</P>
