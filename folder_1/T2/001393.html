				ROUND TOP.</B> Gen. G. K. Warren, Meade's Chief of Engineers, after reviewing
				Sickles' line with Meade, rode to the crest of Little Round Top and found the
				hill, "the key to the Union position," unoccupied except by a signal station.
				Warren was informed by the signalmen that they believed Confederate troops lay
				concealed on the wooded ridge a mile to the west. Smith's New York battery,
				emplaced at Devil's Den, immediately was ordered to fire a shot into these
				woods. The missile, crashing through the trees, caused a sudden stir of the
				Confederates "which by the gleam of the reflected sunlight on their bayonets,
				revealed their long lines outflanking the position." Warren realized Longstreet
				would strike first at Little Round Top and he observed, too, the difficulty of
				shifting Sickles' position from Devil's Den to the hill.</FONT></P> 
			 <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial Greek">At this very moment,
				Sykes' Fifth Corps, marching from its reserve position, began streaming across
				Cemetery Ridge toward the front. Warren sought aid from this corps. In answer
				to his plea for troops, the brigades of Vincent and Weed sprinted to Little
				Round Top. Law's Alabama troops were starting to scale the south slope of the
				hill when Vincent's men rushed to the attack. Weed's brigade, following
				closely, drove over the crest and engaged Robertson's Texans on the west slope.
				The arrival of Hazlett's battery on the summit of the hill is thus described by
				an eyewitness: "The passage of the six guns through the roadless woods and
				amongst the rocks was marvelous. Under ordinary circumstances it would have
				been considered an impossible fear, but the eagerness of the men . . . brought
				them without delay to the very summit where they went immediately into battle."
				A desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensued. Weed and Hazlett were killed, and
				Vincent was mortally wounded&#151;all young soldiers of great
				promise.</FONT></P>

			 <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial Greek">While Law and Robertson
				fought on Little Round Top, their comrades struggled in the fields below. The
				Confederate drive was taken up in turn by the brigades of Benning, Anderson,
				Kershaw, Semmes, Barksdale, Wofford, Wilcox, Perry, and Wright against the
				divisions of three Federal corps in the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, and
				along the Emmitsburg Road. Four hours of desperate fighting broke the Peach
				Orchard salient, an angle in the Union line which was struck from the south and
				the west. It left the Wheatfield strewn with dead and wounded, and the base of
				Little Round Top a shambles. Sickles' men had been driven back, and Longstreet
				was now in possession of the west slope of Big Round Top, of Devil's Den, and
				the Peach Orchard. Little Round Top, that commanding landmark which, in
				Confederate hands would have unhinged the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, still
				remained in Union possession.</FONT></P>

				left was directed to attack Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill in conjunction with
				Longstreet's drive. At the appointed time, the guns of Latimer's battalion on
				Benner's Hill, east of Gettysburg, opened a well-directed fire against the
				Union positions on East Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill, but the return fire soon
				shattered many of Latimer's batteries and forced the remnants to retire out of
				range. In the final moments of this action the youthful Major Latimer was
				mortally wounded.</FONT></P> 
			 <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial Greek">About dusk, long after
				the artillery fire had ceased, Johnson's division charged the Union works on
				Culp's Hill. Although his right failed to make headway because of the steep
				incline and the strength of the Union positions, Steuart's brigade on the left
				had better luck. Here, on the southern slope of the hill, the Union works were
				thinly manned. An hour earlier, the divisions of Geary and Ruger had been
				called from these works to reinforce the Union center. Johnson, finding the
				works weakly defended, took possession of them but did nor press the attack
				further. Only a few hundred yards away on the Baltimore Pike lay the Union
				supply trains. Failure of Confederate reconnaissance here again was critically
				important. Thus passed another opportunity to strike a hard blow at the Union
				Army.</FONT></P> 
			 <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial Greek">Closely timed with
				Johnson's assault, Early's infantry started a charge toward East Cemetery Hill.
				Seldom if ever surpassed in its dash and desperation, Early's assault reached
				the crest of the hill where the defenders, as a last resort in the hand-to-hand
				encounter, used clubbed muskets, stones, and rammers. Long after dark, Early's
				Louisiana and North Carolina troops fought to hold the crest of the hill and
				their captured guns. But the failure of Rodes to move out of the streets of
				Gettysburg and attack the hill from the west enabled Hancock to shift some of
				his men to aid in repelling Early's attack. Faced by these Union reserves,
				Early's men finally gave way about 10 o'clock and sullenly retired to their
				lines. The Union troops stood firm.</FONT></P>
