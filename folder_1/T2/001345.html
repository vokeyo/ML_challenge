<P>The goals of the engineering and environmental management (EEM) program are to educate mid-level managers in the theories, concepts, and techniques of environmental management and to integrate science and policy issues into a decision-making framework for enhanced management of organizations and their impact on the environment. The EEM program provides students with the opportunity to develop and apply a variety of quantitative and qualitative concepts, skills, and techniques to integrate science and policy issues into a decision-making framework for enhanced management of the environment. Upon completion, students are granted a master of science (MS) degree. A thesis is required for graduation. The curriculum includes courses in engineering management, environmental engineering and management, economic decision analysis, organizational management, and communications. The EEM program is conducted in six academic quarters. This program is designed for both the civil and bioenvironmental engineering career fields (55XX and 91XX) and meets the educational requirements for both the 1AGE and 1AGY advanced academic specialty codes.The curriculum consists of 10 core courses, 5 electives to provide needed breadth and depth, and 12 hours of thesis research. The courses provide a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative information concerned with the many facets of engineering and environmental management: environmental, fiscal, technical, behavioral, logistical, contractual, and legal. Electives are designed to broaden the student''s horizons and provide more indepth information in a specific area of interest. A heavy emphasis on environmental science and management addresses the continuing problems with the impact of base operations on the environment (air, water, and land). The thesis must address a real-world problem in an engineering and environmental management area. Principal purposes of the thesis are to demonstrate the student''s ability to integrate concepts and techniques acquired through course work and to demonstrate the student''s written communication skills. Many of the thesis topics are provided by DoD and Air Force agencies interested in sponsoring student research in areas of practical concern.Program graduates are assigned to engineering and environmental management duties at the base, MAJCOM, and higher levels. The output AFSC from the program is normally 55XX or 91XX.</P>

<P><B><I>GAS TURB ACCIDENT INVESTIG - MASL : P169226</I></B></P>
<P>GAS TURBINE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION</P>
<P>Investigating the engine aspects of aviation accidents is a complex, difficult challenge. This is especially true when the new high technology gas turbine engines now in use in commercial aviation are involved. The investigator, even if familiar with the traditional tools and techniques of powerplant investigation must update this knowledge to include the design aspects and failure modes of these new engines.</P>
<P>This course is aimed at gas turbine engines installed in aircraft as part of the propulsion system. The course will discuss the basic modules of the jet engine including the inlet, fan, compression, burner, turbine and exhaust system from the standpoint of how they react as either causes or in ground impact damage in airplane accidents. The course offers an in-depth understanding of all the leading causes of engine related incidents and accidents as well as an up-to-date understanding of the interaction between these causes, the aircraft and the flight crew.</P>
<P>You will learn to recognize the post crash evidence of the most serious engine related accidents - catastrophic rupture of the engine due to uncontained failures, and bird and ice ingestion. You will learn to recognize so-called "benign" engine failures but also will be introduced to how such failures coupled with crew error can lead to a catastrophic accident.</P>
<P>In the first three days of class you will learn some unique investigative techniques to confirm engine involvement and major cause effect. You will then reinforce that classroom experience in examination of actual accident sites at the world s largest aviation crash laboratory. You will actually determine engine involvement and identify major causes in the field.</P>
<P>Just as important to the investigation as the accurate gathering of evidence is the clear, concise and accurate reporting of that evidence to include clear, logical conclusions. The final part of this course will introduce you to the significance of a good report and how to draw conclusions that will support practical recommendations. Finally, You will gain some understanding of the relationship between the involvement of an engine and the rest of the aircraft and operation. This will be done through actual evidence and summaries of studies and work of various industry-wide committees.</P>
<P>When you have completed this course you will have the skill and knowledge to actively and effectively participate in a gas turbine accident investigation and make the necessary field determinations regarding engine operation, impact damage and possible engine involvement in the accident sequence.</P>

<P><B><I>INTELLIGENCE &amp; DEMOCRACY - MASL : P171404</I></B></P>
<P>The Center for Civil-Military Relations (CCMR) offers a one-week course entitled "Intelligence and Democracy," in June, at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, immediately following the CCMR Executive Program in Defense Decision Making. The key objective of this course of instruction is to examine the methods civilian authorities in emerging democracies can use to establish strong, effective controls over their intelligence agencies. The course first examines the intelligence process in established democracies and the potential problems that intelligence activities can pose to democratic governance. Next, participants analyze the mechanisms used by long-established democracies to maintain control over their intelligence organizations. These instruments of control include use of the power of the purse, structural and organizational arrangements, legislative oversight, and public opinion. Employing the case study approach, participants examine the recent efforts by emerging democracies in Latin America, Central Europe, Asia and Africa to establish their own democratic controls over intelligence and the challenges that such nations will face in the future. The educational approach of this course combines informational content along with practical exercises and case studies to provide participants with the skills and knowledge needed to understand how modern democracies design effective mechanisms to control their intelligence agencies. Participants This course is designed for international civilians officials and military officers concerned with developing democratic controls and oversight mechanisms for intelligence agencies. Attendance by several participants from each interested country is encouraged. US participants, civilian and military, also are eligible to attend. Accommodations Participants are normally housed on campus at the Naval Postgraduate School Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQ). These rooms are near the classrooms where the course is conducted. The rooms include a private bath, television, telephone, and a small refrigerator and microwave oven. Accompanying spouses and children may also stay in the BOQ for a small additional charge. Medical care is available on an emergency basis only. Language While there is no formal TOEFL requirement, SAOs and participants should be aware that the course is conducted entirely in English and that the program strongly emphasizes group discussion.

<P>The IDMC course applies basic concepts, techniques, and analysis of comparative resources management to enhance the theoretical knowledge, competence, and capabilities of foreign military and civilian officials. This course is suitable for managers working in any functional field concerned with resource allocation. The major curricular concept of this course is comparative resources management, i.e., the examination of theories and practices of various nations, not only those of the U.S. The Institute stresses that each country is unique and must choose resource management systems that meet its specific needs. To enhance comparative aspects of the curriculum, DRMI encourages broad national representation with a diversity of both military services/agencies and civilian government officials. A typical IDMC class has participants from 35 to 45 countries representing all services and defense and other ministries. Throughout the course DRMI encourages participants to share information and perspectives related to defense management in their own environments. This enables a critical examination of the relationships among management concepts discussed in the course and their applicability to various conditions found in other countries.</P>

<P>The JAWS curriculum is clearly focused on "high end" operational art. This specific and concentrated focus allows for more in-depth immersion and applied rigor than is possible in many more standard military education institutions. Based in part on the existing curricula of the Joint Forces Staff College s Joint and Combined Warfighting School Senior Course, the JAWS curriculum endeavors to balance between operational and strategic studies and between warfighting and war preparation. The interrelated core courses, Foundations in Theory of War, Strategic Foundations and Operational Art and Campaigning provide the developmental framework. Blending theory foundations and historical evidence, the Foundations in Theory of War course provides the underpinning to all that follows through an aggressive series of case studies, guided seminar discussions and guest speakers. This course creates a tentative propositional inventory that enables the student to examine critically and ask the tough questions about military art and science. The Strategic Foundations course provides the necessary solid grounding in the theories of government and diplomacy along with the complex realities of the contemporary joint, interagency and multinational operating environment. Finally, the Operational Art and Campaigning course builds upon the previous instruction to provide students with a laboratory in which to apply the ideas encountered previously. This final applicatory portion of the curriculum emphasizes education and training in aspects of decision-making, problem solving, and planning processes through a series of seminar exercises, wargames and simulations. By emphasizing problem solving and decision-making within the context of adaptive planning, JAWS strives to produce world-class warfighters prepared to operate in a fast paced, often chaotic and multi-tasking environment.Exercises, simulations, extensive reading and research visits are key components of the JAWS program. Through simulations and automation-supported exercises, students analyze and apply joint doctrine, emerging concepts, and recent lessons learned, while also honing planning and decision-making skills. Students have ample opportunity to read and evaluate a broad range of writings throughout the course; significant nightly readings are followed by rigorous examination of authors premises and assertions in daily seminar. Case study method is employed throughout the course. In conjunction with ongoing seminar activities, students are required to write a formal thesis paper and will defend their findings as a part of a comprehensive exam.The JAWS course includes several field research trips. A comprehensive historical staff ride to Gettysburg is conducted to allow students to develop further appreciation for the human dynamics of conflict while focusing on decision-making and senior leader competencies as evidenced in one of America s most significant battles.

<P>LEGAL ASPECTS OF COMBATING TERRORISM:</P>
<P>1. What is a DIILS Legal Aspects of Combating Terrorism in CONUS seminar? </P>
<P></P>
<P>There may be circumstances in which a DIILS Legal Aspects of Combating Terrorism seminar will be conducted in CONUS. The same description applies as for a standard DIILS seminar except the location will be tbd in CONUS and DIILS will have many of the responsibilities that exist for a standing DIILS Resident program. The DIILS CONUS seminar addresses the multi-faceted problem of how to defeat terrorism while adhering to the rule of law. Depending on the unique circumstances in each participating country, DIILS presents a focused seminar on key legal issues. These topics include the military response to terrorism to include rules of engagement and use of force issues; the law enforcement response to terrorism including investigations, prosecution, international law enforcement money laundering, and the involvement of organized crime; maritime security and terrorism where appropriate; border security issues; defining terrorism and the differences of international terrorism and internal armed conflicts; and how interagency cooperation can enhance the fight against terrorism. Presentations by DIILS staff and subject matter experts, case studies based on recent events, discussion problems, and host nation group and individual presentations all work together to create an effective and practical experience for the participants. </P>
<P></P>
<P>2. What will the SAO have to do?</P>
<P></P>
<P>The SAO and the DIILS team work closely to determine all details of the MET. Seminar location, number and choice of participants, timing of the seminar, translation services, gift exchange, finances, opening and closing ceremonies, and press coverage are a few topics which will need to be resolved. In addition the SAO will assist with the in-country transportation and housing for the DIILS team.</P>
<P></P>
<P>3. Who will make up the DIILS team?</P>
<P></P>
<P>Usually, a DIILS team will consist of four team members led by a DIILS staff member. A typical Legal Aspects of Combating Terrorism team consists of civilians who are employees of various government agencies combating terrorism, military operational law experts, and others with experience working in legal matters involving terrorism. </P>
<P></P>
<P>4. What is the cost of a seminar?</P>
<P></P>
<P>Per diem and travel for the team, translation and printing of materials seminar are some of the costs involved in preparing for the seminar. Per diem and travel for participants traveling to CONUS will be required. DIILS will arrange transportation to and from the seminar site and arrange lodging.</P>
<P></P>
<P>5. Who issues the fund cite?</P>
<P></P>
<P>DIILS will issue a fund cite for in-country costs to the SAO. Estimates for all in-country costs should be sent to DIILS as early as possible. NETSAFA manages funding, but sends all monies for a MET to DIILS for further issuance to the SAO.</P>
<P></P>
<P>6. What happens next?</P>
<P></P>
<P>Further seminars and work groups may focus on one or more key legal areas of combating terrorism and work towards a deliverable such as a plan to engage different agencies in developing common legal concepts and de-conflicting the work of the military and civilian law enforcement. </P>
<P></P>
<P>SPECIAL NOTE: Please see Section II of the U.S. Navy International Training &amp; Education Catalog for further information regarding quota procedures. Course is open to and useful for military commanders and staff officers who need to increase knowledge of legal issues involved in military operations or make more effective use of legal advisors. </P>
<P></P>
<P>What do I-LOMO participants learn?</P>
<P></P>
<P>I-LOMO provides the latest information and viewpoints on legal issues applicable to modern military operations including recent developments in the Law of Armed Conflict, Rules of Engagement and the Role of the Military Legal Advisor in Operational Planning. I-LOMO is taught by instructors from the DIILS and the Naval War College.
