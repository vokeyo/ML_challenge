<a NAME="MINUTES"></a>Summary of meeting:</h3>
DAY ONE: Defining broad requirements for global LAI/FPAR/NPP products
<br>_____________________________________________
<p>BACKGROUND Following Alan Strahler's welcome, Jeff Privette opened the
meeting by reviewing milestones in EOS LAI/FPAR/NPP validation planning.
He noted several formal workshops had been held (see EOS Earth Observer,
Vol. 8, No 2, and 10, 3) beginning in 1996. The last workshop had been
a meeting of the EOS instrument teams with the newly funded AM-1 Validation
Investigators in Dec. 1997. In that meeting, Alfredo Huete and Betty Walter-Shea
co-chaired a breakout session on validation of biophysical properties.
This session revealed the absence of LAI/fPAR collection/validation protocols
and hence the need for the present meeting.
<p>Punctuating these workshops were two intra-EOS team Prototype Validation
Exercises (PROVEs), in which ground data were collected, upscaled, and
compared to satellite data/products. Privette noted that the PROVEs coupled
EOS instrument teams to experts in the wider scientific community as well
as in other instrument teams, a result aimed to promote more efficiency
and collaboration post-launch.
<p>Privette challenged meeting participants to work over the two days to
uncover potential flaws in the evolving program, as global LAI/FPAR/NPP
validation has not previously been attempted, and thus conclusions from
this workshop will form a blueprint for the overall scheme. Moreover, meeting
recommendations may ultimately be used in part to defend criticism. He
stressed that while MODLAND is charged with developing a global validation
plan, the resulting plan should apply to similar land products from other
AM-1 instruments such as MISR and ASTER, as well as Landsat 7.
<p>Thus, specific goals for the meeting of the meeting were: 1) to define
criteria for "validation" of global LAI, fPAR and NPP products from EOS
2) review and assess site-level measurement and scaling techniques 3) determine
acceptable protocols/priority for delivery and distribution of validation
results 4) define community needs from instruments and EOS validation investigator
teams
<p>Jeff Morisette then reviewed the MODIS Validation Plan. The Plan was
recently updated (Version 3, October, 1998) to include the EOS Land Validation
Core Sites and MODLAND Product Sites, the potential contribution of the
AM-1 Validation Investigators, the BigFoot and SAFARI 2000 activities,
and other items. It can be downloaded from the redesigned MODLAND validation
page at http://modarch.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODIS/LAND/VAL.
<p>Alfredo Huete then presented a summary of the Biophysical/Vegetation
validation break-out session from the December, 1997, SWAMP meeting. A
variety of issues were raised without resolution in that session. For instance,
would FIPAR be acceptable in place of FPAR, at what solar zenith angles
should it be measured, and how can it be properly scaled? Huete suggested
that a standardized sampling design be developed to help guide field personnel.
He noted the data needs of validation data users vary inversely with the
speed at which they must have the data. Specifically, Huete suggested prioritization
be in order of: product validation, algorithm validation, interdisciplinary
science, and auxiliary science. However, the in-situ data needs of end-users
were not well known. Finally, Huete reminded participants that calibration
issues needed attention. Some possibilities outlined at the Dec. workshop
included single-point calibration labs (Thome, U. of Arizona?) and mobile
calibration transfer instruments.
<p>NPP PRODUCT ALGORITHM AND VALIDATION
<p>Rama Nemani then presented the algorithm for the MODIS NPP product.
The inputs for this product will be the land cover, LAI/fPAR products and
DAO data. Ingesting the DAO data is a major processing load, and there
was some discussion about using actual data for input for annual NPP estimates.
Particular problems raised included partitioning aboveground vs. below
ground biomass, quantifying soil respiration, and validating an NPP product
from the NEE measurements of flux towers. Furthermore, the DAO outputs
are not being validated, and at 2 deg. resolution, may be impossible to
validate, although some comparison with measured data may be useful.
<p>Initially the NPP product will be validated against field measurements
at the four BigFoot/MODLERS sites as well as spatio-temporal patterns of
NPP obtained by various studies as a part of VEMAP, GAIM/IGBP, EUROFLUX
and AmeriFlux. It was noted that general product accuracy may be quite
different than site product accuracy. Bill Emanuel pointed out that a model
inter comparison could be developed to start a data sharing initiative
among NPP modelers/users.
<p>LAI/fPAR ALGORITHM AND VALIDATION
<p>Ranga Myneni presented the algorithm for the MODIS/MISR LAI/fPAR products.
He noted that the definition of LAI was the one sided green leaf area over
a unit area of ground for all biomes except needleleaf, in which case leaf
area is defined as projected leaf area. Further, he noted the 8-day LAI
product as composited based on the maximum FPAR measurement.
<p>The input for this process includes the MODIS land cover (LC, broken
down into six biomes) and surface reflectance products. There are still
questions about how the land cover biome will be determined since the MODIS
LC classification does not map directly into the biome classification [a
particular problem discussed in the subsequent LC meeting was the need
for discrimination between cereal crops and broadleafed crops, and the
current neglect of that division by MODIS landcover algorithm developers].
Myneni noted the biome discretization itself needs validation.
<p>Other issues identified included mixed biome classes at the 1 km resolution
of the product (the algorithm currently assumes single biome in each cell),
and the current averaging of available leaf spectra to fix leaf optical
properties in the model. Emanuel noted that in some biome mixture cases,
a forest cell may be predominately broadleaf deciduous during summer months
but evergreen during winter months, effectively a change in biome type.
The product algorithm currently does not accommodate such changes. Myneni
noted improvements will be possible upon validation data collection, particularly
in the assigning of fixed variable values.
<p>Myneni also noted recent improvements had allowed mapping of errors
in the input data fields to a probabilistic approach in algorithm results.
Thus, the "answer" is an expected value plus a domain of possible values.
Theoretical accuracy varied as a function of the spectral bands available
for input. For example, accuracy decreased when blue wavelengths were used
since this band has more noise. Simulations suggested the overall theoretical
accuracy of the product is 20% (relative). He noted that testing with SeaWiFS
data showed the majority of difficulties are associated with pixels with
NDVI&lt;0.1, i.e., non-vegetated cases. He noted in these cases that if
the soil reflectance is correctly retrieved, this provides good validation
of the algorithm but not the LAI product itself.
<p>Myneni gave a list of minimum requirements for validation field data,
which included spectral canopy reflectances, leaf and soil properties.
Ideally, field data would also include canopy structure. Exact prioritization
of these variables became a topic for a breakout session.
<p>Myneni then outlined five validation "tests" for the LAI/fPAR algorithm
(descriptions available in the handout Myneni provided), including: 1 -
Biome by Biome 2 - Soil Test 3 - Red-NIR Density Plots 4 - NDVI-LAI and
FPAR-NDVI relationships 5 - Information conveyed about LAI by HDRF
<p>He noted that validation of the algorithm at a point scale would help
validate the product at larger scales. This important point suggests that
significant natural variability at a single validation site would add more
statistical significance to the overall validation of the product, despite
the use of relatively few sites globally. Huete asked about the validation
algorithm as it relates to the field data and the algorithm input data.
Myneni described it as a triad of values to be compared: MODIS reflectance
and land cover, field measured data, and the algorithm output. Privette
noted that some cross-algorithm validation could occur since BRDF/albedo,
LAI/fPAR and VI all use different but comparable reflectance models.
<p>CURRENT LAI RELATED RESEARCH
<p>Leonard Brown, of the Environmental Monitoring Section of CCRS, outlined
"LAI Map of Canada", a validation procedure utilizing LAI-2000 and TRAC
instruments, mid-summer TM imagery, and scaling to AVHRR to compare an
LAI map with validation data. Landcover-dependent SR-LAI relationships
developed through BOREAS are used to estimate maximum LAI. The canopy gap
size distribution is estimated from TRAC. This leads to canopy gap estimates,
from which LAI is estimated. They have found collaborators eager to participate
and Brown discussed the effort involved with collecting data from the various
collaborators/sources. He suggested that an agreement could develop between
CCRS and EOS validation for accessing the Canadian data sets. He noted
that while investigators generally were willing to collect the data on
a good will basis (with coauthorships as a carrot), the coordination and
troubleshooting for the network was essentially a full-time job. Instruments
are also loaned out to investigators as necessary. Problem areas included
finding competent users of equipment and getting enough ground data to
justify purchase of high resolution satellite images. Morisette took as
an action item developing a more formal collaboration with Brown's group.
Brown noted that the Chen's TRAC sensor is now commercially available at
roughly US$2000.
<p>Xubin Zeng, from Bob Dickinson's BATS EOS IDS group at U. of Ariz.,
discussed the climate modeling needs of the EOS LAI/fPAR data. He emphasized
that three issues need to be addressed: LAI/fPAR versus fractional vegetation
cover; accuracy requirement of LAI/fPAR in land modeling, and green versus
total LAI. He discussed a new global 1 km fractional vegetation cover data
he derived from the AVHRR NDVI data and IGBP land cover data in collaboration
with several researchers. Using this data, it is possible to convert the
leaf area with respect to pixel to the leaf area with respect to vegetated
portion for use in climate models. Using several field experiments' data
to drive a land model, he demonstrated that the same absolute accuracy
of LAI would introduce much larger errors in simulating evapotranspiration
over grassland (with smaller maximum LAI) than over tropical forest (with
higher maximum LAI). It was suggested however that a relative error, rather
than absolute, was more meaningful for that type of simulation. In addition,
Zeng briefly discussed the community effort on the development of a Common
Land Model (CLM) (one of the motivations for CLM is to make better use
of EOS land data in land modeling). Myneni and Zeng discussed some inconsistencies
in definitions between the LAI algorithm and land model input. Zeng cautioned
that there appears to be a mismatch between the GCM community and product
producers, and their understanding of what is needed. He suggested that
two-stream radiative transfer scheme used in land models should be modified
to be consistent with the derivation of satellite LAI and albedo data.
<p>Privette briefly noted the possibility of including different modeling
groups and validation networks (SAFARI 2000, LTER, SurfRad, FLUXNET, etc.)
into the planning. Myneni brought up the need to know the uncertainty from
the various field measurements and the frequency with which the data are
collected. The discussion focused on ways to establish MODIS validation
methods from the various sources. This methods could then be used to include
other field work from different groups collecting LAI/fPAR measurements.
<p>The group then broke into two discussion groups: 1) Auxiliary Measurements
required for LAI/fPAR algorithm validation (Chair: Myneni) Myneni first
noted that the current biome distribution of the 23 EOS Core Sites appeared
sufficient as a foundation for global validation. It was decided that a
subset of these sites with known LAI/fPAR measurements/investigators would
be used in Year 1 to prototype a ramp-up activity. Representative biome
sites included a mixed northern forest (Gower), a grassland and wheat site
(Walter-Shea), a broadleaf agricultural site (Liang) and two woodland sites
(Privette). Next, a prioritization of Measurements needed at these sites
was outlined, including: 1. LAI and FPAR 2. nadir or bi-directional canopy
(plot) spectra (or in MODIS spectral bands, particularly red, NIR, blue
and green bands) 3. leaf optical properties (raw spectra preferred, although
MODIS bands acceptable; only the mean value of the species in the vertical
direction needed) 4. nadir soil/background spectra (or MODIS bands) 5.
Fractional vegetation cover (a high IDS need was noted here) 6. Canopy
allometric data (height, gap size, crown width) 7. Phenological stage (green-up,
mature, senescent) and species composition (either by MODLAND structural
classification or traditional taxonomy). 8. Additional parameters useful:
wet/dry status (is canopy wet?), and the amount of non-photosynthesizing
vegetation (litter, etc.) which could be measured at one "minimum photosythesis"
stage of the year.
<p>Myneni noted the goal was to constrain model for use in 1-D mode over
a site. Not all measurements would be needed for validation, however, the
more, the better. He noted also that leaf angle distribution, commonly
measured, is not needed for validation. Emanuel noted that for BGC modelers
could use basic meteorological information to help constrain LAI estimates.
<p>2) Developing a Year 1 NPP product validation plan (Chair: Nemani) Nemani's
group developed a list of problem issues that needed resolved. Many of
these had already been raised in Nemani's talk, however the breakout provided
focus opportunity for BigFoot representatives to discuss their approach
with NPP algorithm developers.
<br>_____________________________________________
<p>DAY TWO: Defining tools and approaches at a site-level
<br>_____________________________________________
<p>EOS LAND VALIDATION CORE SITES
<p>Morisette presented the EOS Land Validation Core Site list and discussed
the planned EDC DAAC system that will acquire and archive image data for
these sites and the ORNL DAAC "Mercury" system as a web-based access system
for EOS validation field data. He noted the EDC system is in definitional
stages and must be flexible to accommodate adjustments. Initially, Landsat
and ASTER data ordering must be done via V0-IMS client. MODIS subsetting
may be possible via the&nbsp;&nbsp; MODAPS at GSFC.
<p>Liang inquired about cost-sharing of ETM+ imagery over core sites with
MODLAND. Privette noted MODLAND's goal of purchasing at least four images/year/site.
Emanuel suggests actively mining past LAI/fPAR data from Core Site scientists
to develop expected temporal profiles and "reasonable ranges" for EOS products,
and further to make recommendations to NASA HQ on the in-situ needs from
site investigators. Morisette will take this as an action item. Liang questioned
whether additional satellite data sets could be archived with the Core
Site archives. Privette noted that EDC has thus far been fairly reluctant
to take on Core Site archiving needs, however Strahler, a member of the
EDC working group, suggested that EDC is taking a "wait and see" attitude
for years 1 and 2, and if need is there, they will provide additional capacity
and automation.
<p>MQUALS
<p>Huete presented the MODIS Quick Airborne Looks (MQUALS) package, which
is near completion. He noted the difference in heterogeneity as a function
of scale, and discussed the need for high resolution imagery. MQUALS is
designed to provide: - direct radiometric validation - establish site-level
biophysical-radiometric relationships - document surface conditions with
3-, 4-, band digital imagery at 0.1 - 1.0 meter spatial resolution.
<p>The instrument package will feature an albedometer (full shortwave),
a 3 band digital camera system and a 4 band radiometer (profiler). Huete
recently acquired the digital camera system and had done initial testing
on the ground. The system produced reasonable-looking NDVI imagery. He
emphasized the need for irradiance data with which reflectances could be
generated from the profiler (a ground calibration panel and second profiler
will be used simultaneously with flight). He noted the profiler is to be
used for radiometric integrity, while the integrity of the imager will
be tested upon flight. He suggested the radiometry and ground data sets
could provide the biophysical relationships needed to scale point data
over larger areas. Resolution from the camera will be 10 cm to 1 m. He
suggested that initial flights include 2 altitudes to test scaling, and
be over MODIS calibration sites. Off-nadir pointing profilers could be
added to the system.
<p>Huete outlined the initial protocol for MQUALS: 1) conduct preliminary
stratification for a core site, 2) optimally interpolate to fill in gaps
in the biophysical field data (e.g, LAI), 3 ) provide radiometric data
over area (corresponding to each LC or soil stratification type), 4) overlay
radiometric data on digital imagery and develop relationships, and 5) extend
to VIs, LAI, FPAR. This procedure is to be completed in 7 days after flight.
Liang suggested that 3-4 MQUALS occur per year, and asked who would cover
costs. Huete noted expected costs per deployment were $2500-$3000, but
responsible party needs to be discussed.
<p>BigFoot
<p>Warren Cohen and Dave Turner presented the strategy for BigFoot (the
successor to MODLERS), a program designed to measure and scale surface
data for input to NPP models. BigFoot will model four FLUXNET sites in
year one (BOREAS NSA, Harvard Forest, ARM/CART and Bondville, IL), and
gear its activities to support MODIS LAI/fPAR and NPP validation. They
presented direct and indirect approaches to collecting LAI sample and techniques
for scaling up to the MODIS, 1km resolution. The field measurements will
be scaled up to 1km for a 25 square km area over the flux tower. He noted
the project is mostly centered on NPP estimation, though LAI and landcover
are included to get to NPP. Together with Nemani, they will study how NPP
and NEE covary, and hope to translate between these using modeling. Climatological
and ecological controls on NPP will also be studied, as will be scaling
errors on global NPP characterization.
<p>BigFoot's basic approach will be to measure LAI, LC, FPAR and NPP on
a 5x5 km area, extrapolate these to high resolution grids, characterize
the errors, compare to MODIS products, isolate the effects of LC generalization,
image grain size, and ecological modeling parameters, and examining spatial
autocorrelation and other effects. A minimum seasonal repeat cycle will
be used for direct measurements, possibly more for indirect. Cohen noted
that details of the scaling methods will be worked out in a February, 99
meeting. Emanuel cautioned the BigFoot group about validating a BIOME-BGC-based
MODLAND product with results from BIOME-BGC (circularity). All agreed that
MQUALS initial science flights should focus on BigFoot sites.
<p>EXAMPLE OF FIELD MEASUREMENTS
<p>Brown discussed the various measurement used for validation of the Canada
products and reviewed the TRAC instrument. He noted TRAC compensated for
the limitations imposed by the LAI-2000, primarily related to clumping
which occurs extensively in boreal forests. The result is underestimation
of LAI (up to 100%). The TRAC measures sun flecks over transects to give
gaps size distribution, which is translated to gap fraction.. He recommends
transects be at least 50 m long and up to 200 m in more heterogeneous areas.
A button on TRAC can be used to record fixed intervals on the transect
in the data stream. Software takes solar angle into account. It samples
at 32 Hz. Canadian researchers measure with LAI-2000 simultaneously. Wood-to-total
area ratio and needle-to-shoot data from previous destructive measurements
are used to estimate leaf area. LAI-2000 data is used for multiple-angle
gap fraction data. The Canadians have measured 8-10 different sites, with
10-70 plots per site. The network is 1-2 years old and the data are ready
for distribution.
<p>Bev Law, working in a mixed-age ponderosa pine canopy (45 and 250 years
old), young ponderosa pine (15 years old) and a juniper/sagebrush ecosystem
discussed the Decagon Ceptometer (AccuPAR) and LAI-2000. These areas are
very open with clumped canopies. She recently compared a variety of methods
to estimate LAI at the mixed-age ponderosa pine forest. She compared estimates
from ceptometer data (transmittance inversion; Campbell 1991), sapwood,
litterfall and LAI-2000 data (corrected for needle clumping within shoot
using shoot samples, and clumping at scales larger than shoot using tram
data; Chen 1991). She has a complete stem map for the 100m x 100 m study
area, and her group inverted a 3-D radiative transfer model to estimate
LAI. Based on her comparisons, she recommends the LAI-2000 when corrections
for clumping are used and uniform overcast sky conditions exist. She recommended
leaf litterfall data only for hardwood deciduous forests, not conifers.
She emphasized that green leaf area, not total leaf area, data should be
reported, and that transmittance data must compensate for green-to-total
area, because the instruments measure only white light, which is susceptible
to woody material. Also, one must measure above and below the herbaceous
understory. For moss backgrounds, only reflectance data or mass data needed.
She suggests that the midsummer maximum LAI, and some spring and fall values
are the most that a person can handle due to time.
<p>Jiaquo Qi presented measurement techniques used for arid and semi-arid
regions (San Pedro Basin, SALSA, HAPEX-Niger) using the LAI-2000, and various
sampling strategies and scatter plots showing the relationship between
different biophysical parameters. He estimates total LAI and green/total
biomass over a 1.6 km x 1.8 km area. He noted difficulty in getting 0.5
LAI accuracy in grassland, as destructive is best but slow. He believes
using gapping information outlined by Law may improve his LAI-2000 based
estimates. He notes that leaves are too small in relation to the aperture
of the leaf integrating sphere to get leaf spectra very well.
<p>Betty Walter-Shea presented the work being done on the Osage, OK (ARM/CART
area) wheat and tallgrass sites. This involves canopy reflectances, FPAR,
soil reflectance, leaf optical properties, LAI, biomass, and others. She
suggested that the group needs to develop a cost/effort table to PIs and
NASA HQ on what it takes to acquire requisite data sets. It was noted that
Walter-Shea has developed an efficient WWW-based way to provide up-to-date
descriptions of her site and measurements to the greater community. See:
http://enso.unl.edu/agmet/websummary.htm
<p>The presentations and the discussion that followed indicated that different
biomes do require unique considerations and that, even within a biome,
different measurement techniques and methods of estimation can give different
results. At the very least, the uncertainty in these measurements should
be considered in their use as validation data or modeling efforts.
<p>REVIEW OF RELATED MODIS PRODUCTS
<p>Privette, substituting for Eric Vermote, reviewed the MODIS surface
reflectance product and its validation. He noted validation is largely
based on a relatively immature CIMEL sunphotometer/BRDF network that needs
further development. He has submitted to GSFC a proposal to fund development
of a 14-band next generation sunphotometer that could solve many of the
problems in the current configuration. Status of that proposal should be
known by Dec. 1. [Note the current BRDF instrument is currently collecting
data at Howland, Maine; USDA Beltsville Farms, MD; and Oak Ridge, TN].
In addition, aircraft data from MAS and MASTER will be used for validation.
<p>Huete discussed the validation of the VI products. He noted that MODLAND
reflectances are composited, not just the VIs, such that development of
other indices is possible. The MODLAND VI product in general measures chlorophyll-associated
change, regardless of cause. He would prefer to validate the model, but
will initially seek only to validate the product. He also pointed out that
validation in this context is more than just validating the input reflectance
data -- it is also important to validate that the index responds to actual
vegetation changes. For example, what is the lower threshold of vegetation
change? What is the upper range of saturation? What is the sensitivity
in different biomes? Huete will seek to express the VI and its uncertainties
in terms of biophysical units like LAI and FPAR. He noted that there is
room to develop VI vs. LAI/fPAR model validation.
<p>Wolfgang Lucht and J.P. Muller discussed validation of the BRDF/Albedo
products. They will seek to relate isotropic scattering to overall land
reflectance, and volumetric scattering to LAI, and geometric-optical scattering
to land surface structure/roughness. These are three components of albedo
that might be checked, at least for consistency. They will also develop
relationships between BRFs and albedo based on in-situ measurements, and
develop continental albedo with these relationships and AVHRR. Lucht also
will attempt to relate NDVI, shadowing and kernel values that are retrieved
from MODIS. They have a declining interest in the BSRN and SurfRad global
networks, which appear to have too limited footprints. They are putting
heavy emphasis on ARM/CART, MQUALS, and some dependence on episodic data
and one-time images.
<p>Doug Muchoney reviewed the IGBP land cover validation workshop. The
presentation discussed both the uncertainly of the products and its effect
on the LAI/FPAR/NPP products and their validation. The surface reflectance
and land cover directly effect the LAI/fPAR product because they are input
(biome type is the direct input, which is derived from land cover). The
VI product uncertain will effect the LAI/fPAR validation through the VI/LAI
and VI/FPAR relationship (as described as "test 4" by Myneni in day one).
The BRDF/Albedo validation addressed methods for assessing the field measurement
scaling issue.
<p>DISCUSSION
<p>The group then discussed how the presentation and discussions from the
past two days could help meet the objectives of the meeting and further
develop a validation plan for MODIS biophysical products. Two general topics
were 1) data protocols and 2) scaling/mixtures.
<p>The group decided to focus on 11 Sites in the first year after launch.
<p>The sites were chosen primarily to cover all MODLAND biome types and
to have funded data collection and access, and included:
<p>1 Uardry, Australia (grass; Simon Hook, AM-1 Val.) 2 Osage, Oklahoma
(grass; Shashi Verma) 3 East Anglia, England (grass; J.P. Muller, MODIS)
4 Skukuza, South Africa (woodland; Privette, AM-1 Val.) 5 Mongu, Zambia
(woodland; Privette, AM-1 Val.) 6 San Pedro Basin/SALSA, Ariz. (shrubland;
Huete/Qi, MODIS) 7 USDA BARC, Maryland (broadleaf crop; Liang, AM-1 Val.)
8 Bondville, Illinois (broadleaf crop; BigFoot) 9 Harvard Forest, Mass.
(broadleaf forest; BigFoot) 10 Park Falls, Wisc. (broadleaf forest; Gower,
AM-1 Val.) 11 BOREAS NSA, Canada (needle leaf forest; BigFoot)
<p>Several independently-funded investigators have also volunteered for
possible participation in year one validation, including:
<p>1 Cascades, Or. (needleleaf forest; Law) 2 Canada LAI Network (forest;
Brown) 3 Krasnoyarsk, Russia (needleleaf forest; Slava Kharuk) 4 New Zealand
(forest; Brown) 5 Gainesville, Florida (broadleaf crop; John Craig) 6 EMATREF,
France (needleleaf forest; Jean-Louis Roujean)
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
LAI Validation Sites:</h3>

<p><br><img SRC="images/lai_sites.gif" NOSAVE height=512 width=640>
<p>This is a pilot activity, and participants stressed that the number
of sites will ramp up significantly with time.
<p>Chris Justice discussed the need to better involve the Japanese GLI
and EOS MISR validation groups/sites/activities, and underscored the need
to develop real site contacts at all core sites. Emanuel suggested that
existing networks be contacted about historical data sets that could provide
realistic ranges. The ORNL DAAC mercury system will facilitate the distribution
and access of this data. Beyond these sites, there was discussion about
other locations collecting biophysical reference data and how this might
be used. The discussion turned to incentives for encouraging collaboration
and the idea of data sharing (both EOS image data and field data between
sites) seemed to be a good solution. A suggestion for a CD-ROM with the
initial Core Site data sets, in addition to the WWW pages, received strong
interest. An EOS Earth Observer article upon AM-1 launch might help as
well. Discussion turned to how these "other data sources" could be utilized
for validation and it was proposed that the 11 initial sites will provide
the lessons/tools needed to incorporate other data sets.
<p>The initial sites will produce validation results within a year after
launch and the lessons learned and techniques developed from these will
be used to ramp-up validation analysis to include the wider array of sites
(and networks of sites) that could be available during the second year
after launch. It was noted that in some cases site personnel will only
collect the data, but not compare it to MODIS products. Myneni discussed
his plan to increase his group's attention to validation issues beginning
in the New Year, and expected they would be able to handle all year 1 in
situ data comparisons.

<h3>
<a NAME="INITIAL"></a>Initial Question from June 1998 MODIS Science Team
Meeting:</h3>
1. Number of sites What is the minimum number of LAI/fPAR in-situ sample
sites we need in operation in the first year after launch? 12
<p>What number of in-situ sample sites should we be driving towards in
year 2? 30
<p>2. At what frequency (per season) do LAI/fPAR in-situ measurements need
to be taken over:
<p>green-up mature senescencing dormant temperate broadleaf forest 1 1
1 1 temperate coniferous forest 0 1 0 1 broadleaf cropland 2 2 1 0 cereal
cropland 2 2 1 0 desert 0 1 0 1 shrubland/woodland. 1 1 1 1
<p>3. Using high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery (TM/ASTER/MQUALS)
to extrapolate in-situ values, how many LAI/fPAR assessments are needed
per year over each of the sites?
<p>Estimates: temperate broadleaf forest 6 temperate coniferous forest
4 broadleaf cropland 8 cereal cropland 8 desert 4 shrubland/woodland. 6
<p>4. What is the minimum area per site over which in-situ measurements
need to be taken?
<p>Sufficient, representative coverage to extrapolate to 5 by 5 km. Estimated:
2x2 km
<p>5. What is the minimum area over which aerial extrapolation, using high
resolution imagery should occur?
<p>5 x 5 km area
<p>6. In two-storied systems, are both under- and overstory LAI values
expected or a single, total value?
<p>Under and overstory LAI values are needed

<p>7.What is the maximum uncertainty tolerable in site LAI values? +/-0.6
What uncertainty is realistically desired? +/-0.2- to +/-0.4
<p>8. How should areas containing land cover mixtures in every 1km^2 be
handled in year 1?
<p>Data provider measures individual LAI/fPAR per Land Cover-type, and
spatial Land Cover map. Mixed LC sites should not be emphasized in year
1 sampling, emphasize more "mixed" sites for years 2-4.
<p>In such mixed areas, what sampling frequency should be used? That of
fastest changing LC-type
<p>9. What additional data is most useful but otherwise would not be collected
for validation?
<p>See meetings minutes for full description.
<p>10. What fraction of international (vs. domestic) validation sites are
needed for LAI/fPAR in year 1?
<p>GOAL: 25% International sites
<p>11. How many sites will already be sampled under existing Validation
funding at the resolutions noted above? AM-1 Funding = 6 : Privette (2),
Meyer (1) Walter-Shea (2), Liang (1), Gower (1) (Site funded by BigFoot
program = 4, Possibility of other NASA sites ~2, or independent activity
~10)
<p>12. What is the approximate cost of sampling each of the biome types
one time (in-situ)? Person*days*salary/person=1*2*40k/365=$800
<p>13. FLUXNET/GTOS sites offer a way to expand the EOS LAI/fPAR validation.
What would constitute an affordable pilot activity to demonstrate how EOS
validation could interact with GTOS &ouml; which sites, what can they collect,
do we have protocols for in-kind provisions?
<p>(Part of ongoing work of Baldocchi and Olson's EOS FLUXNET program.)
<p>14. Is there some kind of binding authority/contract that can be set
up to ensure that a non-funded group delivers the required in-situ data?
<p>Leverage on professional good will and emphasis from NASA Research program
for non-EOS projects. Exchanges for MQUALS and TM data. 15. If we suggest
prioritized archive and distribution of AM-1 data, or L7 data sets, can
EDC meet this?
<p>Five sites for year one pilot, possibly all core site if a need is shown.
<p>If not, what is needed and where will it come from? MODAPS, processing
ESIPs, and ORNL are possible distribution points
<p>16. How to best integrate MQUALS into validation protocol?
<p>Huete has developed a protocol, this will put on-line. The sites for
1999 MQUALS will be worked out at the December 1998 MODIS Land Science
team meeting.
<p>17. What fraction of LAI/fPAR collectors are simply providing the raw
data to MODLAND, and what fraction plan to compare these data to MODLAND
products and make evaluations themselves?
<p>Encourage field personnel to pick up task, otherwise BU can accommodate
year 1 load.

<a NAME="directions"></a>Direction to meeting:</h2>
DRIVING INSTRUCTIONS
<br>1. Take Tunnel to Boston. Choose left lane.
<br>2. At far end of tunnel, go STRAIGHT until the LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT,
THEN TURN RIGHT instead of driving onto the curb. This puts you directly
on to the ramp for 93 NORTH. (If you do not wait until the last possible
moment, you will turn right too early and eventually wind up on 93 SOUTH).
<br>3. Take the second exit, about 500 yds from where you entered, for
STORROW DRIVE. Keep left on the ramp. Follow signs for Storrow Drive and
get on it.
<br>4. Stay on Storrow Drive. Generally right or center lanes will work
best.
<br>5. Exit Storrow Drive at KENMORE (left exit). The ramp quickly divides,
and Kenmore is to the right. At the end of the ramp is a traffic light.
TO B.U. SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT:
<br>6. Turn right, but NOT sharp right, onto Beacon Street. Stay to right
through Kenmore Square and you will smoothly flow onto Commonwealth Avenue.
School of Management is on the right about 2 blocks past Kenmore Square.
<p>There is parking underneath at $12/day and on the street. Since Monday
is a legal holiday, the garage is closed but the meters are free. However,
I've been told that if the city wants to enforce the time limits for a
space, they can, but probably won't due to reduced staffing.
<p><b><i>Tunnel Warning:</i></b>
<p><i>If you are driving to BU from Logan Airport on the Columbus Day Holiday,
you will find you have two tunnels to choose from. You want the SUMNER
TUNNEL, NOT the Ted Williams Tunnel.</i>
<p><i>Explanation: The new Ted Williams Tunnel connects the airport and
South Boston. Eventually it will link up with the Mass Turnpike and I-91,
but now it only debauches you in the middle of a major construction zone
for our new underground central artery. Normally it is only open to commercial
traffic, but on weekends and holidays it is open to general traffic as
well.</i>
<p>BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: To School of Management
<p>By Taxi: Take a taxi from the airport. Tell the driver you want the
Boston University School of Management located just past the Howard Johnson's
in KENMORE SQUARE on COMM AVE. The fare should be around $15. Tip 10-15%
on the meter. There will be an extra charge for airport service.
<p>By Subway (The "T"):
<br>1. Take the airport shuttle bus (free) to the T stop, buy a token (85
cents). Then take the BLUE LINE inbound.
<br>2. At the GOVERNMENT CENTER stop, change to the GREEN LINE westbound,
B, C, or D car. All of these will stop at KENMORE.
<br>3. Get off at KENMORE. As you exit from Kenmore at the turnstiles,
turn right. You will emerge on the north side of Commonwealth Avenue. (If
you can see the Barnes and Noble Bookstore across the street, you are on
the south side of Comm Ave. Go back down and take the tunnel to the north
side.)
<br>4. Walk west about 2 blocks to the School of Management, on the right.
