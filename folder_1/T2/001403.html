Between its creation in 1915 and itsdemise in 1958, it published more than 16,000 reports sought afterand exploited by aeronautical engineers throughout the United Statesand abroad. It developed wind tunnels, as well as other equipment andtechniques, that revolutionized aeronautical research. The data thatit gathered are still employed in aircraft design. Five times theNACA and its staff won or shared the Collier trophy, America'spremier aeronautical prize for the most significant contribution toflight in a given year. Though the NACA had its failures andshortcomings, its reputation for efficiency and effectiveness was sowidespread and transcendent that it came to be viewed as something ofa model research organization.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The idea of the NACA as a model arose early inits history and continues to the present. One NACA veteran hasdeclared that the NACA's example of government organization forresearch was a greater contribution than the Committee's technicaloutput. An early NACA chairman asserted that the NACA's uniquestructure was an indispensable ingredient of its technical success.In 1940, Vannevar Bush modeled the National Defense ResearchCommittee upon the NACA and tried unsuccessfully to model theNational Science Foundation upon it as well. In the 1970s much of theaeronautical community favored revival of the NACA to handle allgovernment research and development in civil aviation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This book examines the NACA as an institution,attempting to explain how and why it functioned and to evaluate it asa research organization. Although the NACA's technical achievementspermeate the story, this book is not a technical history. TheCommittee's research accomplishments are set forth more directly inGeorge C. Gray's </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Frontiers of Flight:The Story of NACA Research</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">, Jerome C.Hunsaker's "Forty Years of Aeronautical Research," and in theCommittee's own technical publications, all of which are described inthe appendixes and bibliography. This book is primarily a politicaland institutional history focusing on the NACA as a model researchorganization.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">xiv</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The principalthemes of this story are three: First are the institutionalconsiderations. Institutions shape and are shaped by the researchthey conduct. In theory, the Committee's structure and independentstatus within the federal hierarchy made the NACA an ideal forumwherein all branches of American aeronautics could debate and developa national research program. In practice, some voices were louderthan others and independence bred not freedom but insecurity.Committees can exploit a wide variety of talents and viewpoints, butthey can also elevate consensus over wisdom. Industry, excluded atfirst from NACA councils, came in time to dominate them. Without asolid political base, or even an unequivocal raison d'etre, the NACAengaged in a running war for survival, guarding its flanks againstcriticism, fighting rearguard actions against forces of abolition ormerger, courting allies where it found them-in Congress, the militaryservices, other executive branches, the aircraft industry, andelsewhere-and outflanking enemies as best it could. Politicalinsecurity bred habits of conservatism, self-promotion, reliance oncommittees of experts, deference to clients, and a concern forterritoriality, all of which influenced the style and content of itsresearch program-at least, the research program formulated inWashington. Insulated from the politics of bureaucratic survival, thestaffs at the NACA laboratories saw the Committee's research programdifferently. In the early years, size, geographic proximity, andesprit de corps kept the headquarters and its single laboratory moreor less in harmony, diminishing the usual tension between aheadquarters and its field installations. Later, expansion weakenedthe bonds, enhancing the autonomy of the laboratories even as theheadquarters sought to enforce its policies through a larger staffand more elaborate operating procedures.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The second theme encompasses personnelpolicies and how they shaped NACA research. Committed originally tothe "scientific study" dictated by its organic legislation, the NACAturned within its first decade to an engineering orientation that itnever thereafter abandoned. Engineers held most key positions withinthe NACA. Young engineers were recruited right out of undergraduateschooling and trained to the NACA style. Loyalty and teamwork werevalued above brilliance. Some scientists worked successfully in thisenvironment, and the dividing line between science and engineeringoften blurred beyond recognition in the complex process ofaeronautical research. Still, the NACA remained primarily anengineering organization, with all the advantages and disadvantagessuch an orientation would entail.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Finally, research equipment shaped the NACA'sprogram fully as much as did its organization and personnel. The windtunnel dominates aeronautical research just as the microscopedominates biology, the telescope astronomy, and the particleaccelerator nuclear physics. [</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">xv</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The NACA achievedearly success and acclaim by developing revolutionary wind tunnelsfor aerodynamical research. Thereafter the tunnels took on a life oftheir own, influencing the pace and direction of NACA research;concentrating the Committee's attention on aerodynamics when fieldslike propulsion, structures, and helicopters had equal merit; andbecoming in time a sort of end in themselves. The NACA used its windtunnels to great advantage, but the wind tunnels also used theNACA.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This study is both a narrative history-theauthor's account of what was significant in the career of theNACA-and a reference work from which the essential facts of theCommittee's history can be readily retrieved. To keep the onefunction from intruding on the other, most of the factual data on theNACA appear in appendixes: all the major legislation affecting theCommittee, the committee structure and composition, the budget andpersonnel histories, the facilities, the details of the NACA researchprocess and its resulting reports, and a selection of representativeand significant documents. In appendixes, this information is easierto find and does not clutter the text, which is a comparativelybrief, interpretative, and analytical survey of the Committee'shistory directed at specialists and nonspecialists alike.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This history has been written primarily fromthe records of the NACA headquarters, supplemented with extensiveresearch in the records of the NACA laboratories, in the records ofother agencies and institutions, and in the secondary literature,which is lamentably sparse. But the primary perspective is that ofheadquarters. It was, after all, the headquarters that ran the NACA,and it is in these records that the course of NACA history can betraced most readily and fully. This account might have benefited fromfurther research in the records of the laboratories and of the NACA'principal clients, the military services and the aircraftmanufacturers. But preliminary consultation of these sourcessuggested that additional research would merely have confirmed thebroad conclusions reached here and would have complemented, notaltered, the story. Furthermore, one purpose of this book was toserve as a guide to the records of the NACA, introducing them toother researchers in related fields; that purpose was best served bymaking the fullest possible use of the NACA material.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Only a handful of the major characters arementioned in the text. By design, the men and women of the NACAworked as a team, collaborating freely across institutional anddisciplinary boundaries and editing each other's work until thepublished reports were as uniform and impersonal as a militarytraining manual. By all reports, the people of the NACA had as muchhumor and liveliness as any comparable group, but it was not the kindof humor that comes across on paper, in the few instances where itwas allowed in print at all. It was instead an [</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">xvi</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] engineer's humor,narrow, esoteric, almost sophomoric, evoking gales of laughter fromthe initiate with punchlines like but he had given him a screw with aleft-handed thread." Mostly, the record of the NACA is dry, correct,impersonal, and colorless. The few personalities that do emerge toinfluence the course of events are described in the text. Other keypeople of the NACA are named in </FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="app-d.htm">Appendix D</A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva">.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Participants in the story have been quoted atlength-even, at times, without being identified-to give the reader anopportunity to interpret some of the material for himself and toconvey the flavor of the literary style of the engineer, who writeswith a safety factor of three. As if building a bridge that can intheory support three times the weight it is expected to bear, thetypical engineer builds a sentence with enough words to repeat hismessage twice. Aeronautical engineers generally deal with a safetyfactor of 1.5 but their sentences tend to be no less weighty thanthose of their civil and mechanical colleagues.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of the author's principal aims has been tokeep the text brief, nontechnical, and on course. Supplementarymaterial-illustrative quotations, historical asides, debating points,technical data, and comments on the sources-may be found in thenotes, along with the normal documentation of the text. Thespecialist can consult the notes to amplify topics of particularconcern to him; the general reader also may find the additionalinformation interesting and rewarding. The NACA was a long-standinghouse of many rooms, not all of which could be fully explored in atext of this compass.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Finally, some home truths about the style andtone of this study. One NACA veteran, commenting on the manuscript,guessed that "in his heart of hearts Roland simply finds moreinterest and excitement in NACA's failings than in its successes."There is more than a little truth in that observation. In researchingand writing this book, I was much more alive to the NACA'sshortcomings than I was to its virtues.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I did not consciously plan to emphasize thenegative; rather, that pattern emerged from three separate butrelated causes. First, as a kept historian in the employ of theagency about which I was writing, I set out with a personal andprofessional interest in demonstrating that official history need notbe court history, that the agency historian (at least in this agency)can be critical and independent, that he can contradict the partyline when the evidence warrants it without fear of censorship orrecrimination. This ambition may well have led me to be overzealousin finding fault with the NACA. The good news is that I have at leastproved my point-perhaps at the expense of the NACA for NASA 'readilyagreed to publish the manuscript, an excess of wartsnotwithstanding.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Second, the headquarters records the source onwhich I relied most heavily-are enough to raise the hackles of eventhe most sympathetic [</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">xvii</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] historian. Theyare filled with myopic, self-serving, politically motivatedpropaganda. I can appreciate that the NACA was forced into thispublic posturing by the nature of pluralistic politics in Washington,that all government agencies engage in such practices, and that workin the laboratories was generally untainted with the grime of publicrelations. Still, one cannot immerse himself in those records forseveral years without wanting to puncture the balloon ofself-aggrandizement that was inflated in the NACAheadquarters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Finally, I remain seriously concerned aboutthe ability of the official record to convey a critical picture ofthe NACA. Virtually all those in a position to knowledgeably assessthe Committee had a vested interest in keeping their objections andmisgivings to themselves. The NACA was not anxious to air its dirtylaundry, and I think the desire to emphasize the positive finallyproduced an inability to acknowledge the negative-at headquarters,certainly, and to a lesser degree in the laboratories. Those inindustry and the military services who relied on the NACA had everyreason to praise the Committee in public lest their criticismscontribute to either a decline in the Committee's budget or areluctance on the part of the Committee to do the work they wanted.With the possible exception of academics, I can think of nocontemporary group likely to criticize the NACA freely andknowledgeably. If my book seems overly critical, it is partly tocorrect this imbalance in the public record.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In revising my manuscript for publication, Ihave sought to eliminate the imbalances, both pro and con, thatappeared in the work. Some harsh judgments simply will not wash out;some bouquets are no doubt sweeter than they should be. In sum, theNACA that appears in these pages corresponds as closely as I couldmake it to the one I found in the Committee's files. Readers maydecide for themselves to what extent it was a model researchorganization.</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;<HR></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="foreword.htm"><IMGSRC="previous.gif" ALT="previous" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="contents.htm"><IMG SRC="index.gif" ALT="index"WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="acknowl.htm"><IMG SRC="next.gif" ALT="next"WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
