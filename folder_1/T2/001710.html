<p>Sec. 400.400 Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed (CPG 7132.15)<br>
</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: </p>

<p>The term &quot;homeopathy&quot; is derived from the Greek words homeo (similar) and
pathos (suffering or disease). The first basic principles of homeopathy were formulated by
Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700's. The practice of homeopathy is based on the belief
that disease symptoms can be cured by small doses of substances which produce similar
symptoms in healthy people. <br>
</p>

<p>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) recognizes as official the drugs and
standards in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States and its supplements
(Sections 201 (g)(1) and 501 (b), respectively). Until recently, homeopathic drugs have
been marketed on a limited scale by a few manufacturers who have been in business for many
years and have predominantly served the needs of a limited number of licensed
practitioners. In conjunction with this, homeopathic drug products historically have borne
little or no labeling for the consumer. <br>
</p>

<p>Today the homeopathic drug market has grown to become a multimillion dollar industry in
the United States, with a significant increase shown in the importation and domestic
marketing of homeopathic drug products. Those products that are offered for treatment of
serious disease conditions, must be dispensed under the care of a licensed practitioner.
Other products, offered for use in self-limiting conditions recognizable by consumers, may
be marketed OTC. <br>
</p>

<p>This document provides guidance on the regulation of OTC and prescription homeopathic
drugs and delineates those conditions under which homeopathic drugs may ordinarily be
marketed in the U.S. Agency compliance personnel should particularly consider whether a
homeopathic drug is being offered for use (or promoted) significantly beyond recognized or
customary practice of homeopathy. If so, priorities and procedures concerning the agency's
policy on health fraud would apply. (See CPG 7150.10 &quot;Health Fraud-Factors in
Considering Regulatory Action&quot; 6/5/87). <br>
</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS: <br>
</p>

<p>The following terms are used in this document and are defined as follows: <br>
</p>

<p>1. Homeopathy: The practice of treating the syndromes and conditions which constitute
disease with remedies that have produced similar syndromes and conditions in healthy
subjects. <br>
</p>

<p>2. Homeopathic Drug: Any drug labeled as being homeopathic which is listed in the
Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS), an addendum to it, or its
supplements. The potencies of homeopathic drugs are specified in terms of dilution, i.e.,
1x (1/10 dilution), 2x (1/100 dilution), etc. Homeopathic drug products must contain
diluents commonly used in homeopathic pharmaceutics. Drug products containing homeopathic
ingredients in combination with non-homeopathic active ingredients are not homeopathic
drug products. <br>
</p>

<p>3. Homeotherapeutics: Involves therapy which utilizes drugs that are selected and
administered in accordance with the tenets of homeopathy. </p>

<p>4. Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS): A compilation of standards for
source, composition, and preparation of homeopathic drugs. HPUS contains monographs of
drug ingredients used in homeopathic treatment. It is recognized as an official compendium
under Section 201(j) of the Act. <br>
</p>

<p>5. Compendium of Homeotherapeutics: An addendum to the HPUS which contains basic
premises and concepts of homeopathy and homeotherapeutics; specifications and standards of
preparation, content, and dosage of homeopathic drugs; a description of the proving*
process used to determine the eligibility of drugs for inclusion in HPUS; the technique of
prescribing the therapeutic application of homeopathic drugs; and a partial list of drugs
which meet the criteria of the proving process and are eligible for inclusion in HPUS and
other homeopathic texts. <br>
</p>

<p>6. Extemporaneously Compounded OTC Products: Those homeopathic drug products which are
often prepared by dilution to many variations of potency from stock preparations, and
which: (1) have at least one OTC indication; (2) are prepared pursuant to consumers' oral
or written requests; and (3) are not generally sold from retail shelves. Those products
which are prescription drugs only cannot be provided to consumers as extemporaneously
compounded OTC products but, may only be prepared pursuant to a prescription order. <br>
</p>

<p>*7 Health Fraud: The deceptive promotion, advertisement, distribution or sale of
articles, intended for human or animal use, that are represented as being effective to
diagnose, prevent, cure, treat, or mitigate disease (or other conditions), or provide a
beneficial effect on health, but which have not been scientifically proven safe and
effective for such purposes. Such practices may be deliberate, or done without adequate
knowledge or understanding of the article.* </p>

<p>*A proving is synonymous with the homeopathic procedure (identified in HPUS as a
&quot;Research Procedure&quot;) which is employed in healthy individuals to determine the
dose of a drug sufficient to produce symptoms. <br>
</p>

<p>DISCUSSION: <br>
</p>

<p>Section 201(g)(1) of the Act defines the term &quot;drug&quot; to mean articles
recognized in the official United States Pharmacopeia (USP), the official Homeopathic
Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS), or official National Formulary (NF) or any
supplement to them; and articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
treatment, or the prevention of disease in man or other animals; articles (other than
food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other
animals; and articles intended for use as a component of any articles specified in the
above. Whether or not they are official homeopathic remedies, those products offered for
the cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of disease conditions are regarded as drugs
within the meaning of Section 201(g)(l) of the Act. </p>

<p>Homeopathic drugs generally must meet the standards for strength, quality, and purity
set forth in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia. Section 501(b) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 351)
provides in relevant part: <br>
</p>

<p>Whenever a drug is recognized in both the United States Pharmacopeia and the
Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States it shall be subject to the requirements of
the United States Pharmacopeia unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homeopathic
drug, in which case it shall be subject to the provisions of the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia
of the United States and not to those of the United States Pharmacopeia. <br>
</p>

<p>A product's compliance with requirements of the HPUS, USP, or NF does not establish
that it has been shown by appropriate means to be safe, effective, and not misbranded for
its intended use. <br>
A guide to the use of homeopathic drugs (including potencies, dosing, and other
parameters) may be found by referring to the following texts: A Dictionary of Practical
Materia Medica by John Henry Clarke, M.D., (3 volumes; Health Science Press) and A
Clinical Repertory to the Dictionary of Materia Medica by John Henry Clarke, M.D. (Health
Science Press). These references must be reviewed in conjunction with other available
literature on these drug substances. <br>
</p>

<p>POLICY:<br>
</p>

<p>LABELING <br>
</p>

<p>Homeopathic drug product labeling must comply with the labeling provisions of Sections
502 and 503 of the Act and Part 201 Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), as
discussed below, with certain provisions applicable to extemporaneously compounded OTC
products. Those drugs in bulk packages intended for manufacture or preparation of
products, including those subsequently diluted to various potencies, must also comply with
the provisions of Section 502 of the Act and Part 201 (21 CFR 201). <br>
</p>

<p>General Labeling Provisions <br>
</p>

<p>Name and Place of Business: Each product must bear the name and place of business of
the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in conformance with Section 502(b) of the Act and
21 CFR 201.1. </p>

<p>Directions for Use: Each drug product offered for retail sale must bear adequate
directions for use in conformance with Section 502(f) of the Act and 21 CFR 201.5. An
exemption from adequate directions for use under Section 503 is applicable only to
prescription drugs. <br>
</p>

<p>Statement of Ingredients: Ingredient information shall appear in accord with Section
502(e) of the Act and 21 CFR 201.10. Labeling must bear a statement of the quantity and
amount of ingredient(s) in the product in conformance with Section 502(b) of the Act, as
well as 21 CFR 201.10, expressed in homeopathic terms, e.g., lx, 2x. </p>

<p>Documentation must be provided to support that those products or ingredients which are
not recognized officially in the HPUS, an addendum to it, or its supplements are generally
recognized as homeopathic products or ingredients. <br>
</p>

<p>Established Name: The product must be in conformance with Section 502(e)(1) of the Act
and must bear an established name in accord with Section 502(e)(3) of the Act and 21 CFR
201.10. Many homeopathic products bear Latin names which correspond to listings in the
HPUS. Since Section 502(c) of the Act and 21 CFR 201.15(c)(1) require that all labeling be
in English, the industry is required to translate these names from Latin to their common
English names as current labeling stocks are depleted, or by June 11, 1990, whichever
occurs first. It is permissible for industry to include in the labeling both English and
Latin names. <br>
</p>

<p>Container Size - Labeling Exemption: For those products packaged in containers too
small to accommodate a label bearing the required information, the labeling requirements
provided under Section 502 of the Act and 21 CFR 201 may be met by placing information on
the carton or outer container, or in a leaflet with the package, as designated in 21 CFR
201.10(i) for OTC drugs and in 21 CFR 201.100(b)(7) for prescription drugs. However, as a
minimum, each product must also bear a label containing a statement of identity and
potency, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor. <br>
</p>

<p>Language: The label and labeling must be in the English language as described and
provided for under 21 CFR 201.15(c)(1), although it is permissible for industry to include
foreign language in the labeling, as well. <br>
</p>

<p>Prescription Drugs <br>
</p>

<p>The products must comply with the General Labeling Provisions above, as well as the
provisions for prescription drugs below. </p>

<p>Prescription Drug Legend: All prescription homeopathic drug products must bear the
prescription legend, &quot;Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without
prescription,&quot; in conformance with Section 503(b)(1) of the Act. <br>
</p>

<p>Statement of Identity: The label shall bear a statement of identity as provided for
under 21 CFR 201.50. </p>

<p>Declaration of Net Quantity of Contents and Statement of Dosage: The label shall bear a
declaration of net quantity of contents as provided in 21 CFR 201.51 and a statement of
the recommended or usual dosage as described under 21 CFR 201.55. </p>

<p>General Labeling Requirements: The labeling shall contain the information described
under 21 CFR 201.56 and 21 CFR 201.57. For all prescription homeopathic products, a
package insert bearing complete labeling information for the homeopathic practitioner must
accompany the product. <br>
</p>

<p>OTC Drugs <br>
</p>

<p>Product labeling must comply with the General Labeling Provisions above and the
provisions for OTC drugs below, as current labeling stocks are depleted or by June 11,
1990, whichever occurs first. </p>

<p>Principal display Panel: The labeling must comply with the principal display panel
provision under 21 CFR 201.62. <br>
</p>

<p>Statement of Identity: The label shall contain a statement of identity as described in
21 CFR 201.61. <br>
</p>

<p>Declaration of Net Quantity of Contents: The label shall conform to the provisions for
declaring net quantity of contents under 21 CFR 201.62. <br>
</p>

<p>Indications for Use: The labeling for those products offered for OTC retail sale must
bear at least one major OTC indication for use, stated in terms likely to be understood by
lay persons. For extemporaneously compounded OTC products, the labeling must bear at least
one major OTC indication for use, stated in terms likely to be understood by lay persons.
For combination products, the labeling must bear appropriate indications(s) common to the
respective ingredients. Industry must comply with the provisions concerning indications
for use as current labeling stocks are depleted, or by June 11, 1990, whichever occurs
first. </p>

<p>Directions for Use: See the General Labeling Provisions above. </p>

<p>Warnings: OTC homeopathic drugs intended for systemic absorption, unless specifically
exempted, must bear a warning statement in conformance with 21 CFR 201.63(a). Other
warnings, such as those for indications conforming to those in OTC drug final regulations,
are required as appropriate. <br>
</p>

<p>Prescription/OTC Status <br>
</p>

<p>The criteria specified in Section 503(b) of the Act apply to the determination of
prescription status for all drug products, including homeopathic drug products. If the
HPUS specifies a distinction between nonprescription (over-the-counter (OTC)) and
prescription status of products which is based on strength (e.g., 30x) - and which is more
restrictive than Section 503(b) of the Act - the more stringent criteria will apply.
Homeopathic products intended solely for self-limiting disease conditions amenable to
self-diagnosis (of symptoms) and treatment may be marketed OTC. Homeopathic products
offered for conditions not amenable to OTC use must be marketed as prescription products. </p>

<p>Home Remedy Kits Homeopathic home remedy kits may contain several products used for a
wide range of conditions amenable to OTC use. When limited space does not allow for a list
of those conditions on the labels of the products, the required labeling must appear in a
pamphlet or similar informational piece which is enclosed in the kits. However, as a
minimum, each product must also bear a label containing a statement of identity and
potency. </p>

<p>Other Requirements </p>

<p>All firms which manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or otherwise process
homeopathic drugs must register as drug establishments in conformance with Section 510 of
the Act and 21 CFR 207. Further, homeopathic drug products must be listed in conformance
with the sections above. (Note: For a given product, variations in package size and
potency are not required to be listed on separate forms 2657 but instead, may be listed on
the same form). Homeopathic drug products must be packaged in accordance with Section
502(g) of the Act. Homeopathic drug products must be manufactured in conformance with
current good manufacturing practice, Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act and 21 CFR 211.
However, due to the unique nature of these drug products, some requirements of 21 CFR 211
are not applicable, as follows: <br>
</p>

<p>1. Section 211.137 (Expiration dating) specifically exempts homeopathic drug products
from expiration dating requirements. </p>

<p>2. Section 211.165 (Testing and release for distribution): In the Federal Register of
April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14003), the Agency proposed to amend 21 CFR 211.165 to exempt
homeopathic drug products from the requirement for laboratory determination of identity
and strength of each active ingredient prior to release for distribution. </p>

<p>Pending a final rule on this exemption, this testing requirement will not be enforced
for homeopathic drug products. </p>

<p>REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE: <br>
</p>

<p>Those firms marketing homeopathic drugs which are not in compliance with the conditions
described above will be considered for regulatory follow-up. &lt;&gt; The Office of
Compliance, HFD-304, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, should be consulted before
*warning* letters are issued. <br>
</p>

<p>Recommendations for the issuance of *warning* letters or other regulatory sanctions
must be submitted in conformity with the Regulatory Procedures Manual and other Agency
guidance concerning the review of regulatory actions. </p>
