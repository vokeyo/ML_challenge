food ingested (Lusk 1933). In the 19th century, European and American
scientists isolated and began to identify the major groups of nutrients in the
diet, to develop the first estimates of nutrient requirements, and to explore
the basics of energy metabolism. For example, in 1816, Magendie of
France established that nitrogen-containing compounds were essential in
the diet of dogs; in 1838, these compounds were given the name protein
(from the French word for "primary substance"). In 1814, the French
chemist Chevreul discovered that fats consisted of fatty acids attached to a
glycerol molecule. By 1834, the London physician Prout was able to
introduce the idea that food consists of substances called saccharine, oily,
and albuminous-today called carbohydrates, fats, and proteins
(Todhunter 1959). Later in the century, Rubner ofGermany and Atwater of
the United States established the energy values of these substances as
approximately 4, 9, and 4 kcal/g, respectively (McCollum 1957).

Thus, from the time of Lavoisier to the end of the 19th century, knowledge
of nutritional science grew to encompass the metabolic basis of energy
production from food, the classification of nutrients and sources of energy,
the dependence of energy requirements on physical activity, the influence
of diet on body weight and of fevers on metabolism of food substances, the
principles of metabolic homeostasis, and the roles of specific essential
nutrients in human physiology (Murlin 1948). During this period, lemon
juice was found to prevent scurvy, iodine to prevent goiter, and in-
completely milled rice to prevent beriberi. Despite these advances, the
most fundamental concepts about nutrition were still poorly developed at
the beginning of the 20th century. It was not until the first half of this

27


O Nutrition and Health

century that scientists identified human nutritional requirements, charac-
terized the nutritional value of proteins, and identified the amino acids,
vitamins, fatty acids, and minerals essential in the human diet (Todhunter
1976). For example, Osborne and Mendel of Yale University elucidated the
differences between complete and incomplete proteins during the first
decades of this century. Later, Rose of the University of Illinois estab-
lished which of the amino acids were essential and estimated how much of
each was required each day.

The diseases of scurvy, beriberi, rickets, and pellagra had been described
in very early writings, but their specific causes were not identified until
after 1900. In 1906, Hopkins of Cambridge University suggested that food
contained certain accessory factors necessary for prevention of these
conditions. In 1912, Funk named these factors "vitamines," later called
vitamins as more was learned about their chemical structure (Rosen 1958).

Early in the century, the dietary cause of pellagra was established by
Goldberger, a PHS physician, and fat- and water-soluble vitamins were
isolated and characterized (McCollum 1957). Also during this period,
kwashiorkor was identified as a nutritional disease and the importance of
prenatal diet on the health of newborn infants began to be appreciated
(Darby 1985). Over the next three decades, all of the vitamins were
identified, starting with the isolation of a fat-soluble substance in egg yolk
by McCollum at the University of Wisconsin, now known as vitamin A,
and continuing with the discoveries of folic acid, vitamin Br2, and other B
vitamins in the 1930's and 1940's (McCollum 1957). The essential nature of
trace elements such as selenium and zinc were finally recognized in the
1950's and 1960's (Darby 1985).

After World War II, the major focus of attention in nutrition began to shift
away from acute nutrient deficiency diseases. The advent of improved
transportation systems and home refrigeration and frozen foods expanded
the year-round availability of fresh and wholesome foods, and food for-
tification helped to increase the availability of previously scarce nutrients.
At the same time, vaccines, antibiotics, and other advances in medicine
and health prevented and controlled many of the infectious diseases that
had previously shortened the human lifespan. Thus, chronic degenerative
diseases became more important as causes of illness and death. Nutrition
scientists began to examine the relationship of modem dietary patterns and
practices to these chronic diseases-cardiovascular disease, cancer, and
diabetes, for example-that were becoming increasingly prevalent among

28


Introduction and Background cl

Americans in middle and late life, and attention shifted to the effects of
specific nutrients and dietary factors on the long. slow development of
these conditions.

Evolution of .Federal Nutrition Policy

As knowledge developed in the nutrition sciences and on the health effects
of food, and as food availability and consumption patterns became more
apparent, nutrition assumed an increasingly visible role in pubtic policy.
By 1979, the Federal Government was involved in efforts to ensure an
adequate, safe, and nutritious food supply for Americans through spon-
sorship of more than 350 programs in key areas of nutrition policy: agricul-
tural support, food safety and regulation, food fortification, food assis-
tance, nutrition services and training, food intake and nutritional status
monitoring, food and nutrition research, and food and nutrition education
(Comptroller General 1979). Some of these programs had rdots that
reached back to the turn of the century. but since World War I1 the
Government's efforts have increasingly focused on meeting the needs of
high-risk groups and on the role of-diet in health promotion and disease
prevention. Table l-3 presents a chronological listing of selected events in
the development of Federal domestic nutrition policies; the history of
Federal initiatives in the major areas of nutrition policy is reviewed below.

Agricultural Support. The earliest Federal nutrition policies in this area
were designed to strengthen the agricultural production system and to
ensure a consistent and adequate food supply. In 1862. the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture (USDA) was created, and the Morrill Act established
land grant universities as sites for agricultural training and research. The
Hatch Act of 1887 authorized the creation of agricultural experiment
stations. As a result of these and other policies. food production increased
and farmers began to produce more food than could be consumed. Even-
tually, a system of commodity price and income supports was developed to
stabilize the economic condition of the farm sector. The Agricultural and
Consumer Protection Act of 1973 and the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977
established the basis for current agricultural support policies (Stucker and
Boehm 1978; Boehm 1979).

Food Safety and Regulation. The pure food movement of the late 1800's,
led by Dr. Harvey Wiley, chief of the Government's Bureau of Chemistry,
and popularized by the publication of Upton Sinclair's novel of 1906, The
Jungle, led Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906-then
known as the Wiley Act-which prohibited interstate transport and sale of
misbranded or adulterated foods (Ziporyn 1985). This Act and the Federal
Meat Inspection Act, also passed that year, extended Federal responsibil-
ity into the arena of food safety. Significant revisions to the legislation
occurred in 1938 when the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act established
standards of identity and quality for certain foods, required ingredient
listings on food labels, and prohibited sales of foods that were determined
to be harmful to health. In 1958, the Food Additives Amendment to the
1938 Act shifted the burden of proof of safety to the manufacturer, required
that additives known to cause cancer in either humans or animals be
deemed unsafe (the Delaney Clause), and established the list of ingredients
in common use that were "Generally Recognized As Safe" (GRAS) for
human consumption. A 1960 Color Additives Amendment applied the
Delaney Clause to all chemical food coloring agents. Since 1969, a major
review has been under way of the safety of substances on the GRAS list
(Smith and Rulis 1981). Regulation of food safety is a shared responsibility

of several Federal agencies, primarily the USDA for plant, animal,
poultry production; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for all c
foods and additives; and the Environmental Protection Agency
pesticide contaminants.

The food labeling provisions of the 1906 and 1938 Acts were designe
protect consumers against fraudulent misbranding of foods, and this pc
was extended by the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act of 1%6, which cz
for accurate ingredient labeling on foods in interstate commerce (PC
1987). More recently, interest has grown in the use of food labels to edu
consumers about the nutritional quality of food and the role of nutritic
health. Regulations published in 1973 authorized voluntary nutrition la
ing and required nutrition labeling for fortified foods and those for WI
nutritional claims were made (Hutt 1981). In 1987, the FDA proposed a
policy for public health messages on food labels to permit health claim
package labels when the information is true and certain criteria are
(FDA 1987). Responsibility for regulating labeling and marketing prc
dures related to foods is shared by the USDA (meat, poultry, eggs), F
(all other foods) and, for advertising, the Federal Trade Commission (.
ter 1987).

Food Fortrjication. The onset of World War I brought new nutritic
concerns and focused attention on the need for an overall improvemer,
the availability of nutrients to the general population. The first food
tification program, instituted in 1924, was the addition of iodine to sal
prevent goiter. During the Second World War, this program was extendel
include enrichment of wheat flour with iron and the vitamins thian
niacin, and riboflavin. Also during the 1940's, milk was fortified v
vitamin D and margarine with vitamin A.

Food Assisrunce. As early as 1918, the idea of targeting food assistance
vulnerable population groups was proposed in the Children's Bureau p
lication Milk-The Indispensable Food for Children. Milk supplies 1
decreased and prices increased due to the effects of World War I, and
Children's Bureau advocated that children be given priority in allocat
milk supplies. Charitable organizations established milk stations and cc
munity kitchens to provide food supplements to the poor and to help peo
with limited income choose and prepare an adequate diet (Egan 1980

Widespread unemployment anda overty during the 1930's stimulated I
development of new Federal programs to provide food assistance to i
poor. At first, these programs focused exclusively on distribution of surp
agricultural commodities. In 1930, for example, the USDA and the Fede

34


Introduction and Background 0

Emergency Relief Administration began a distribution program as food
relief. The donation of surplus foods to child nutrition and school lunch
programs was authorized by amendments to the Agricultural Act in 1933.
The more formally organized Food Distribution Program was established
in 1935. An experimental Food Stamp Program was initiated by the Surplus
Commodities Corporation in 1939. The National School Lunch Program
was established in 1946, and the Special Milk Program was added in 1954
(U.S. Senate 1976).

In the early 1960's, as a result of surveys and assessments indicating special
needs among low-income populations (Citizens' Board 1968), the Federal
Government expanded its involvement in income support and direct deliv-
ery of food services. A pilot study in 1961 led to the Food Stamp Act of
1965, which authorized a small-scale program to meet limited needs for
food assistance. The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 established the School
Breakfast Program. Following the 1969 White House Conference on Food,
Nutrition, and Health (White House Conference 1970), eligibility and
benefits were enlarged for the Food Stamp, School Lunch, School Break-
fast, Special Milk, and Summer Food Programs; the Special Supplemental
Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIG) was created;
general assistance reimbursements were increased (for the School Break-
fast and School Lunch Programs); and the Nutrition Program for the
Elderly was established through an amendment to the Older Americans
Act. From I%9 to 1977, Federal expenditures for these programs increased
from about $1.2 to $8.3 billion (U.S. Senate 1977a). By 1986, as many as 50
million Americans (the exact number is uncertain due to overlapping
benefits) were served by food assistance programs administered by the
USDA. The cost of these programs exceeded $18.8 billion in 1986 and $20
billion in 1987 (Matsumoto 1987).

Nutrition Services and Training. In the 1920's under the Federal Maternity
and Infancy Act, nutrition services were launched in nine State depart-
ments of public health. Enactment of the Social Security Act in 1935,
authorizing grants-in-aid to the States for health services for mothers and
children, was a major impetus for the further development of nutrition
services in State health agencies. By 1945, all but three States had one or
more nutrition consultant positions included in their budgets. Nutrition
services began to extend beyond maternal and child health during the late
1950's and early 1960's in response to new mental retardation, chronic
disease control, home health service, and nursing home and other ex-
tended care programs. Initiatives in primary health care, family planning,
and comprehensive health planning during the 1970's further expanded the
availability of nutrition services (Nutrition Services Project Committee

35


cl Nutrition and Health

1983), as did establishment of the Community Food and Nutrition Program
(CFN) in the 1980's to provide nutrition services to low-income popula-
tions (Office of Community Services 1987).

To ensure an adequate supply of health professionals to serve the popula-
tion, the Federal Government also supports health professions education
in primary care as well as public health practice. Since the 1940's, funds
have been available from Title V of the Social Security Act for nutrition
training of health professionals, and since 1957, various authorities under
Title VII of the Public Health Service Act have supported health profes-
sions students and curriculum development in applied nutrition, including
capitation grants to schools of public health that support traineeships for
public health nutrition students.

Food Intake and Nutrition Status Monitoring. The involvement of the
Federal Government in monitoring of food intake dates back to 1893 when
the USDA received an appropriation for this purpose (Porter 1986). The
USDA first began to collect data on the wholesale availability or "disap-
pearance" of food commodities in 1909. The subsequent annual collection
of such data has provided an important source of information on trends in
the availability of food, an indirect indicator of food use by the population
(Bunch 1987). Attempts to estimate actual food intake by the population
began in the 1930's. For example, household food purchases were exam-
ined by the USDA in 1936-37 through the first Nationwide Food Consump-
tion Survey (NFCS); such surveys have been conducted about every 10
years since, most recently in 1987-88 (USDA 1986,1987a, 1987b). Estima-
tions of the per capita nutrient content of the food supply began in the
1940's and are now reported annually (Marston and Raper 1986). The first
collections of data on the food consumption habits of individuals in
sampled households were performed by the USDA in 1%5 (NRC 1984).
Examples of food intake and availability data are given later in this chapter
in the section on dietary patterns.

Assessment of nutritional status emerged as a concern as early as 1918
when infants and children were weighed and measured during the opening
event of the Children's Year Campaign (initiated to "protect children from
the effects of war"). The impetus for this activity was the high percentage
of Selective Service rejections in World War I caused by conditions that
might have been prevented or corrected by adequate nutrition in early
childhood. The first studies of nutrition and child health were conducted by
the Children's Bureau in a mountainous section of Kentucky in 1920 and in
the industrial area of Gary, Indiana, in 1922 (Egan 1980).

36


Introduction and Background O

Much of the recent expertise in measuring human nutritional status was
developed through the work of the Interdepartmental Committee on Nutri-
tion for National Defense, which conducted nutrition surveys in more than
30 countries during the 1950's and 1960's. Attempts to evaluate the nutri-
tional status of the U.S. population began in 1956 when Congress autho-
rized the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) to
conduct periodic national health examination surveys; with the addition in
1971 of additional status measures, including a dietary intake component,
these surveys evolved into the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES). The first NHANES was conducted from 1971-74,
the second from 1976-80, and the Hispanic HANES from 1982-84 (DHHS/
USDA 1986). The third NHANES started in 1988. In l%8-70, in response
to increasing concern about the nutritional status of low-income popula-
tions, DHEW sponsored the Preschool (Owen et al. 1974) and Ten-State
(DHEW 1972) Nutrition Surveys and identified evidence of malnutrition in
these populations.

The dietary intake, health, and nutritional status surveys and surveillance
systems listed in Table l-4 and described above are components of the
National Nutrition Monitoring System-a complex assortment of inter-
connected activities that provide regular information about dietary intake
and nutritional status to the health of the American people and about
factors that affect diet and nutritional status (DHHS/USDA 1987). The
present system was proposed in 1978 in response to a congressional re-
quest in the 1977 Food and Agriculture Act that the Secretaries of Agri-
culture and of Health, Education, and Welfare, now Health and Human
Services (DHHS), develop a joint proposal for a comprehensive system
that would monitor the nutritional status of the American people. In 1981, a
Joint implementation Pfun (revised in 1987) committed the two Depart-
ments to close coordination of survey methods and to submission of
reports to Congress every 3 years on information gained from monitoring
activities. The National Nutrition Monitoring System includes efforts by
several Federal agencies to provide information about health and nutri-
tional status, food consumption, food composition, dietary knowledge and
attitudes, and food safety and quality.

Food and Nutrition Research. The Federal role in nutrition research began
in 1887 with the development of the forerunner of the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) as a one-room laboratory on Staten Island. In 1893, the
USDA was authorized to perform agricultural and human research. The
PHS Hygienic Laboratory developed into the first National Institute of
Health in 1930; subsequently, it was joined by other laboratories to create

u Nutrition and Health

the present research enterprise of NIH (Simopoulos 1986). In 1975, the
NIH Nutrition Coordinating Committee was established to address NIH
nutrition issues that span the goals and purposes of 12 Institutes, 2 Divi-
sions, and 2 Centers within the agency. The FDA began conducting nutri-
tion research in 1938. By 1976, Federal expenditures for nutrition research
and research training exceeded $73 million (U.S. Senate 1976). The amount
was reported as nearly $200 million by 1979 (JSHNR 1980) and $270 million
in 1984, of which nearly $200 million represented research supported by
NIH (ICHNR 1986; NIH 1987). In 1987, NIH expended a total of $261
million, reinforcing its longstanding position as the major Federal agency in
biomedical and behavioral nutrition research and training support. This
nutrition research encompasses a broad range of topics, including health
maintenance, human development throughout the life cycle, disease pre-
vention, and disease treatment.

The Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research (ICHNR) was
established by the Secretaries of DHHS and USDA to succeed the Joint
Subcommittee on Human Nutrition Research that operated out of the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to coordinate all
Federal nutrition research activities. The ICHNR produced a 5-year plan
for human nutrition research that reviewed the research activities of eight
Federal agencies, listed research priorities, and identified six areas for
expanded research investigation: nutritional requirements at various
stages of the life cycle, nutrition interactions and bioavailability, nutrition
and chronic diseases, energy regulation and eating disorders, nutrition
monitoring, and nutrition education methodology (ICHNR 1986).

Dietary Guidance and Nutrition Education. The Federal Government has
supported efforts to teach the public about nutrition since 1867 when the
Office of Education was established with responsibility for nutrition educa-
tion within the public schools. The Children's Bureau of the Department of
Labor published Prenatal Care in 1913 and Znfant Care in 1914 to provide
dietary guidance to mothers. These books have been in publication ever
since and are all-time best sellers of the U.S. Government Printing Offtce.

The USDA also had an early role and published its first food selection
guide, designed to help parents meet the nutritional needs of young chil-
dren, in 1916 (Hunt 1916). Since that time, federally supported dietary
guidance materials have been issued and revised regularly to meet the
needs of specific target audiences and to reflect emerging knowledge of
nutritional science. A list of Federal dietary guidance publications for the
general public since 1917 is presented in Table l-5.

Introduction and Background O

The earliest federally sponsored guidelines advised the public to consume
portions from a variety of food groups every day to obtain sufficient energy
and to avoid nutritional deficiencies. As more was learned about nutrients
essential in the diet, recommendations began to emphasize consumption of
foods containing vitamins, minerals, and other "protective" dietary com-
ponents (Hertzler and Anderson 1974). In response to the economic crisis
of the 1930's, the USDA began to develop meal plans for consumers at
different levels of income to address issues of cost (Haughton, Gussow,
and Dodds 1987).

The first Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA's) for intake of energy
and eight nutrients were developed by the National Research Council and
adopted at the wartime National Nutrition Conference in 1941 (Roberts
1958). RDA's have been published periodically since; the most recent
(ninth) edition appeared in 1980 (NRC 1980). Its recommendations are
reviewed later in this chapter. Also in 1941, the USDA, in cooperation with
the Offtce of Education and the PHS, published the first Federal guide to
incorporate information on specific vitamins and minerals and the first to
use the term "enriched." Meal plans and dietary guidelines published since
the 1940's have been designed increasingly to translate the RDA's into
terms usable by consumers (Hertzler and Anderson 1974). The USDA's
1958 Food for Fitness-A Daily Food Guide, written in terms of four food
groups, was the first to promote intake of specific nutrients-alcium,
vitamin A, and vitamin C-that were commonly consumed in amounts
substantially below RDA levels (Haughton, Gussow. and Dodds 1987).

Typically, an adequate diet has been defined as providing the basic food
groups that would contain amounts of essential nutrients-protein, vi-
tamins, and minerals-sufficient to prevent deficiency diseases. In the
mid-1970's, however, the focus of national policy objectives expanded to
encompass the role of overconsumption of fat, cholesterol, salt, sugar, and
alcohol as dietary factors associated with chronic disease. The increasing
scientific interest in these relationships led the U.S. Senate to hold hear-
ings on diet and health from 1973 through 1977 (U.S. Senate 1977a).
Expanding knowledge of the role of diet in health maintenance also led to
the development in 1975 of a DHEW Policy Statement on Health Aspects
of Nutrition (U.S. Senate 1976). Thus, dietary adequacy began to include
consideration of the most reasonable proportions of dietary factors for
prevention of chronic-rather than deficiency--diseases.

This new perspective was reflected in the two editions of the 1977 report
Dietary Goals for the United States, produced by the Senate Select Com-
mittee on Nutrition and Human Needs (U.S. Senate 1977b. 1977~). These


u Nutrition and Health

reports recommended significant changes in average dietary intake pat-
terns to improve protection against the principal chronic diseases. To
accomplish this goal, they established quantitative targets for consumption
of complex carbohydrates and naturally occurring sugars (greater than 48
percent of energy), refined and processed sugars (10 percent of energy),
total fats (less than 30 percent of energy), saturated fat (less than 10 percent
of energy), cholesterol (less than 300 mglday), and salt (less than 5 g/day)
(U.S. Senate 1977~).

These principles, although not the quantitative targets, were supported and
expanded in the 1979 report Healthy People: The Surgeon General's
Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (DHEW 1979) and by
the 1980 publication Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, jointly issued and revised in 1985 by the Departments of
Agriculture and of Health and Human Services (USDAIDHHS 1985). The
Guidelines recommend:

o Eat a variety of foods.
o Maintain desirable weight.
o Avoid too much fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.
o Eat foods with adequate starch and fiber.
o Avoid too much sugar.
o Avoid too much sodium.
o If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.

This approach reflects the increase in interest in the relation between
nutrition and prevention of chronic diseases, a development that has
shaped and mandated Federal nutrition education activities of the past
decade (see Table l-4) and is the principal focus of the discussion, conclu-
sions, and recommendations of this Report.

Scientific Background

Human Nutritional Requirements

Essential nutrients must be obtained from the diet in the proper amounts
and proportions to maintain good health and to prevent deficiency dis-
eases. A deficiency of an essential nutrient causes signs and symptoms that
can be prevented or cured by an increased intake of the nutrient. Such
deficiencies may be due to inadequate dietary intake, or they may be

46


Introduction and Background 0

induced by either inherited or acquired inabilities to absorb, transport,
store, or metabolize nutrients or by excessive losses of nutrients from the
body (for example, from vomiting, bleeding, or diarrhea).

Just as a deficiency of a nutrient can cause disease, too much of a nutrient
can also lead to disease. For example, as discussed throughout this Report,
the excessive consumption of energy, fat (especially saturated fat), and
alcohol have been associated with the development of specific chronic
disease conditions in some individuals. Excessive intake of some vitamins
and most of the minerals also has been shown to result in either acute or
long-term disorders. For most nutrients, there appears to be a safe and
adequate range of dietary intake that satisfies nutritional requirements but
does not cause untoward symptoms. This concept is illustrated in Figure
l-1. Ideally, the diet should contain energy and all of the essential nutrients
in amounts that fall within these ranges of intake.

u Nutrition and Health

Recommended Dietary Allowances

The need to establish goals for good nutrition in the United States was
recognized in the 1930's and led to the establishment in 1940 of the
Committee on Food and Nutrition, now called the Food and Nutrition
Board, of the National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences.
The Committee's initial purpose was to make sure that the population was
adequately nourished during World War II, and one of its early functions
was to recommend quantities of nutrients that should be provided to the
Armed Forces and the general population. These recommendations led to
the development of goals for intake of nine specific nutrients that would
meet the known nutritional requirements of men, women, and children of
varying ages. These first RDA's were adopted in 1941 (Roberts 1958), and
they have been published at 5- to lo-year intervals since 1943. Although the
original purpose of the RDA's was to promote nutritional health during
wartime, their purpose has expanded over the years to include use for
development of standards for food assistance programs, food labels, and
evaluation of dietary adequacies.

Because research on human nutritional requirements is often incomplete
or inconsistent, and because of variability in individual nutrient require-
ments, the RDA's represent an estimated, rather than an absolute, stan-
dard of dietary adequacy, and they are revised periodically to reflect
current scientific evaluation of the available nutrition research. The most
recent revision was published in 1980 and is presented in Table l-6 (NRC
1980). The RDA's are defined as ". . . the levels of intake of essential
nutrients considered, in the judgment of the Committee on Dietary Allow-
ances of the Food and Nutrition Board on the basis of available scientific
knowledge, to be adequate to meet the known nutritional needs of prac-
tically all healthy persons." Thus, each RDA is deliberately set higher than
the.actual requirement for that nutrient in most individuals.

Specific RDA's have been established for protein, 10 vitamins, and 6
minerals; they are presented in categories that vary according to body size.
gender, and energy consumption (NRC 1980). RDA's are usually higher for
males than for females, except for women who are pregnant or lactating.
For 12 additional nutrients, research has been too limited to establish
specific RDA's and the Food and Nutrition Board has proposed ranges of
daily intake that are considered "safe and adequate." These are presented
in Table l-7. The RDA's are designed to exceed the nutrient requirements
of most individuals, but the allowances for energy are designed to reflect
average needs for people of different heights and weights, ages, and activi-
ty levels.

  f The folacin allowances refer to dietary sources as determined by Lactobacillus casei assay after treatment with enzymes (conjugates) to make
   polyglutamyl forms of the vitamin available to the test organism.
  @Ihe recommended dietary allowance for vitamin B12 in infants is based on average concentration of the vitamin in human milk. The allowances
  after weaning are based on energy intake (as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics) and consideration of other factors, such
    as intestinal absorption.
