  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Youth Drinking: 
    Risk Factors and Consequences</I></B> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>D</B>espite a minimum 
    legal drinking age of 21, many young people in the United States consume alcohol. 
    Some abuse alcohol by drinking frequently or by binge drinking--often defined 
    as having five or more drinks* in a row. A minority of youth may meet the 
    <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition </I>(DSM-IV) 
    criteria for alcohol dependence (1,2). The progression of drinking from use 
    to abuse to dependence is associated with biological and psychosocial factors. 
    This <I>Alcohol Alert</I> examines some of these factors that put youth at 
    risk for drinking and for alcohol-related problems and considers some of the 
    consequences of their drinking. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Prevalence of Youth 
    Drinking</I></B> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirteen- to fifteen-year-olds 
    are at high risk to begin drinking (3). According to results of an annual 
    survey of students in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades, 26 percent of 8th graders, 
    40 percent of 10th graders, and 51 percent of 12th graders reported drinking 
    alcohol within the past month (4). Binge drinking at least once during the 
    2 weeks before the survey was reported by 16 percent of 8th graders, 25 percent 
    of 10th graders, and 30 percent of 12th graders. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Males report higher rates 
    of daily drinking and binge drinking than females, but these differences are 
    diminishing (3). White students report the highest levels of drinking, blacks 
    report the lowest, and Hispanics fall between the two (3). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A survey focusing on the 
    alcohol-related problems experienced by 4,390 high school seniors and dropouts 
    found that within the preceding year, approximately 80 percent reported either 
    getting &quot;drunk,&quot; binge drinking, or drinking and driving. More than 
    half said that drinking had caused them to feel sick, miss school or work, 
    get arrested, or have a car crash (5). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some adolescents who drink 
    later abuse alcohol and may develop alcoholism. Although these conditions 
    are defined for adults in the DSM, research suggests that separate diagnostic 
    criteria may be needed for youth (6). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Drinking and Adolescent 
    Development</I></B> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While drinking may be 
    a singular problem behavior for some, research suggests that for others it 
    may be an expression of general adolescent turmoil that includes other problem 
    behaviors and that these behaviors are linked to unconventionality, impulsiveness, 
    and sensation seeking (7-11). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Binge drinking, often 
    beginning around age 13, tends to increase during adolescence, peak in young 
    adulthood (ages 18-22), then gradually decrease. In a 1994 national survey, 
    binge drinking was reported by 28 percent of high school seniors, 41 percent 
    of 21- to 22-year-olds, but only 25 percent of 31- to 32-year-olds (3,12). 
    Individuals who increase their binge drinking from age 18 to 24 and those 
    who consistently binge drink at least once a week during this period may have 
    problems attaining the goals typical of the transition from adolescence to 
    young adulthood (e.g., marriage, educational attainment, employment, and financial 
    independence) (13). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Risk Factors for 
    Adolescent Alcohol Use, Abuse, and Dependence</I></B> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Genetic Risk Factors.</I></B> 
    Animal studies (14) and studies of twins and adoptees demonstrate that genetic 
    factors influence an individual's vulnerability to alcoholism (15,16). Children 
    of alcoholics are significantly more likely than children of nonalcoholics 
    to initiate drinking during adolescence (17) and to develop alcoholism (18), 
    but the relative influences of environment and genetics have not been determined 
    and vary among people. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Biological Markers.</I></B> 
    Brain waves elicited in response to specific stimuli (e.g., a light or sound) 
    provide measures of brain activity that predict risk for alcoholism. P300, 
    a wave that occurs about 300 milliseconds after a stimulus, is most frequently 
    used in this research. A low P300 amplitude has been demonstrated in individuals 
    with increased risk for alcoholism, especially sons of alcoholic fathers (19,20). 
    P300 measures among 36 preadolescent boys were able to predict alcohol and 
    other drug (AOD) use 4 years later, at an average age of 16 (21). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Childhood Behavior.</I></B> 
    Children classified as &quot;undercontrolled&quot; (i.e., impulsive, restless, 
    and distractible) at age 3 were twice as likely as those who were &quot;inhibited&quot; 
    or &quot;well-adjusted&quot; to be diagnosed with alcohol dependence at age 
    21 (22). Aggressiveness in children as young as ages 5-10 has been found to 
    predict AOD use in adolescence (23,24). Childhood antisocial behavior is associated 
    with alcohol-related problems in adolescence (24-27) and alcohol abuse or 
    dependence in adulthood (28,29). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Psychiatric Disorders.</I></B> 
    Among 12- to 16-year-olds, regular alcohol use has been significantly associated 
    with conduct disorder; in one study, adolescents who reported higher levels 
    of drinking were more likely to have conduct disorder (30,31). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Six-year-old to seventeen-year-old 
    boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were also found 
    to have weak social relationships had significantly higher rates of alcohol 
    abuse and dependence 4 years later, compared with ADHD boys without social 
    deficiencies and boys without ADHD (32). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whether anxiety and depression 
    lead to or are consequences of alcohol abuse is unresolved. In a study of 
    college freshmen, a DSM-III (33) diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence 
    was twice as likely among those with anxiety disorder as those without this 
    disorder (34). In another study, college students diagnosed with alcohol abuse 
    were almost four times as likely as students without alcohol abuse to have 
    a major depressive disorder (35). In most of these cases, depression preceded 
    alcohol abuse. In a study of adolescents in residential treatment for AOD 
    dependence, 25 percent met the DSM-III-R criteria for depression, three times 
    the rate reported for controls. In 43 percent of these cases, the onset of 
    AOD dependence preceded the depression; in 35 percent, the depression occurred 
    first; and in 22 percent, the disorders occurred simultaneously (36). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Suicidal Behavior.</I></B> 
    Alcohol use among adolescents has been associated with considering, planning, 
    attempting, and completing suicide (37-39). In one study, 37 percent of eighth-grade 
    females who drank heavily reported attempting suicide, compared with 11 percent 
    who did not drink (40). Research does not indicate whether drinking causes 
    suicidal behavior, only that the two behaviors are correlated. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Psychosocial Risk 
    Factors</I></B> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Parenting, Family 
    Environment, and Peers.</I></B> Parents' drinking behavior and favorable attitudes 
    about drinking have been positively associated with adolescents' initiating 
    and continuing drinking (41,42). Early initiation of drinking has been identified 
    as an important risk factor for later alcohol-related problems (43). Children 
    who were warned about alcohol by their parents and children who reported being 
    closer to their parents were less likely to start drinking (42,44,45). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lack of parental support, 
    monitoring, and communication have been significantly related to frequency 
    of drinking (46), heavy drinking, and drunkenness among adolescents (47). 
    Harsh, inconsistent discipline and hostility or rejection toward children 
    have also been found to significantly predict adolescent drinking and alcohol-related 
    problems (46). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peer drinking and peer 
    acceptance of drinking have been associated with adolescent drinking (48,49). 
    While both peer influences and parental influences are important, their relative 
    impact on adolescent drinking is unclear. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Expectancies.</I></B> 
    Positive alcohol-related expectancies have been identified as risk factors 
    for adolescent drinking. Positive expectancies about alcohol have been found 
    to increase with age (50) and to predict the onset of drinking and problem 
    drinking among adolescents (51-53). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Trauma.</I></B> 
    Child abuse and other traumas have been proposed as risk factors for subsequent 
    alcohol problems. Adolescents in treatment for alcohol abuse or dependence 
    reported higher rates of physical abuse, sexual abuse, violent victimization, 
    witnessing violence, and other traumas compared with controls (54). The adolescents 
    in treatment were at least 6 times more likely than controls to have ever 
    been abused physically and at least 18 times more likely to have ever been 
    abused sexually. In most cases, the physical or sexual abuse preceded the 
    alcohol use. Thirteen percent of the alcohol dependent adolescents had experienced 
    posttraumatic stress disorder, compared with 10 percent of those who abused 
    alcohol and 1 percent of controls. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Advertising.</I></B> 
    Research on the effects of alcohol advertising on adolescent alcohol-related 
    beliefs and behaviors has been limited (55). While earlier studies measured 
    the effects of exposure to advertising (56), more recent research has assessed 
    the effects of alcohol advertising awareness on intentions to drink. In a 
    study of fifth- and sixth-grade students' awareness, measured by the ability 
    to identify products in commercials with the product name blocked out, awareness 
    had a small but statistically significant relationship to positive expectancies 
    about alcohol and to intention to drink as adults (57). This suggests that 
    alcohol advertising may influence adolescents to be more favorably predisposed 
    to drinking (57). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Consequences of 
    Adolescent Alcohol Use</I></B> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Drinking and Driving.</I></B> 
    Of the nearly 8,000 drivers ages 15-20 involved in fatal crashes in 1995, 
    20 percent had blood alcohol concentrations above zero (58). For more information 
    about young drivers' increased crash risk and the factors that contribute 
    to this risk, see <I>Alcohol Alert No. 31: Drinking and Driving </I>(59). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Sexual Behavior.</I></B> 
    Surveys of adolescents suggest that alcohol use is associated with risky sexual 
    behavior and increased vulnerability to coercive sexual activity. Among adolescents 
    surveyed in New Zealand, alcohol misuse was significantly associated with 
    unprotected intercourse and sexual activity before age 16 (60). Forty-four 
    percent of sexually active Massachusetts teenagers said they were more likely 
    to have sexual intercourse if they had been drinking, and 17 percent said 
    they were less likely to use condoms after drinking (61). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Risky Behavior and 
    Victimization.</I></B> Survey results from a nationally representative sample 
    of 8th and 10th graders indicated that alcohol use was significantly associated 
    with both risky behavior and victimization and that this relationship was 
    strongest among the 8th-grade males, compared with other students (62). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Puberty and Bone 
    Growth.</I></B> High doses of alcohol have been found to delay puberty in 
    female (63) and male rats (64), and large quantities of alcohol consumed by 
    young rats can slow bone growth and result in weaker bones (65). However, 
    the implications of these findings for young people are not clear. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Prevention of Adolescent 
    Alcohol Use</I></B> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Measures to prevent adolescent 
    alcohol use include policy interventions and community and educational programs. 
    <I>Alcohol Alert No. 34: Preventing Alcohol Abuse and Related Problems </I>(66)

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Youth Drinking: Risk 
  Factors and Consequences--A Commentary by<BR>
  NIAAA Director Enoch Gordis, M.D.</I></B> </font> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alcohol, the most widely 
    used and abused drug among youth, causes serious and potentially life-threatening 
    problems for this population. Although alcohol is sometimes referred to as 
    a &quot;gateway drug&quot; for youth because its use often precedes the use 
    of other illicit substances, this terminology is counterproductive; youth 
    drinking requires significant attention, not because of what it leads to but 
    because of the extensive human and economic impact of alcohol use by this 
    vulnerable population. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For some youth, alcohol 
    use alone is the primary problem. For others, drinking may be only one of 
    a constellation of high-risk behaviors. For these individuals, interventions 
    designed to modify high-risk behavior likely would be more successful in preventing 
    alcohol problems than those designed solely to prevent the initiation of drinking. 
    Determining which influences are involved in specific youth drinking patterns 
    will permit the design of more potent interventions. Finally, we need to develop 
    a better understanding of the alcohol treatment needs of youth. Future questions 
    for scientific attention include, what types of specialized diagnostic and 
    assessment instruments are needed for youth; whether treatment in segregated, 
    &quot;youth only&quot; programs is more effective than in general population 
    programs; and, irrespective of the setting, what types of specific modalities 
    are needed by youth to increase the long-term effectiveness of treatment.
