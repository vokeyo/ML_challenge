The FDA–USP relationship was reinforced in 1938 with the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that continued to cite USP standards and added those for packaging and labeling. </P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">In addition to legal recognition, collaboration between these two important public health organizations has existed throughout the century in many other ways, including scientific cooperation and shared leadership. Hundreds of FDA employees have<SPAN class=MsoCommentReference><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"> </SPAN></SPAN>worked with USP to establish standards by participating as members of USP’s Expert Committees and its ad hoc Reviewer and Observer Programs.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In addition, many former FDA officials have served as USP volunteer leaders, including FDA founder Harvey Wiley, who served as USP President from 1910 to 1920. Former FDA Commissioners Jere Goyan, Arthur Hull Hayes, and Jane Henney also served as USP volunteers. Shared staff leadership has included Joseph Valentino, Jerome Halperin, and Roger L. Williams.</P>
