 a description of a physical problem is translated into a
mathematical statement in order to find a solution;
<p>
 relationships between physical quantities are determined
using the shape of a curve passing through experimentally
obtained data;
<p>
 the slope of a linear relationship is calculated and includes
appropriate units;
<p>
 interpolated, extrapolated, and analyzed trends are used to
make predictions; inferential statistical tests are applied in
evaluating experimental data; and analysis of systems employs
vector quantities utilizing trigonometric and graphical methods.
<p>
The student will investigate and understand how to demonstrate
scientific reasoning and logic.  Key concepts include:
<p>
 analysis of primary sources to develop and refine research
hypotheses; analysis of how science explains and predicts
relationships; and evaluation of evidence for scientific theories
and how new discoveries may either modify existing theories
or result in establishing a new paradigm.
