BOREAS RSS-04 1994 Southern Study Area Jack Pine LAI and FPAR Data

Summary

The RSS-04 team collected several data sets related to leaf, plant, and stand 
physical, optical, and chemical properties.  This data set contains leaf area 
indices and FPAR measurements which were taken at the three conifer sites in the 
BOREAS SSA during August 1993 and at the jack pine tower flux and a subset of 
auxiliary sites during July and August 1994.  The measurements were made with 
LAI-2000 and Ceptometer instruments.  The measurements were taken for the 
purpose of model parameterization and to test empirical relationships that were 
hypothesized between biophysical parameters and remotely sensed data.  The data 
are stored in tabular ASCII files.

1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS RSS-04 1994 Southern Study Area Jack Pine LAI and FPAR Data

1.2 Data Set Introduction

Estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and fraction of Photosynthetically Active 
Radiation (FPAR) were made during the Focused Field Campaign in summer 1993 
(FFC-93) and the second Intensive Field Campaign (IFC-2) in 1994.  In FFC-93, 
preliminary measurements were made using a LI-COR LAI-2000 and a Decagon Devices 
Ceptometer at the three conifer tower flux sites Young Jack Pine (YJP), Old Jack 
Pine (OJP), and Old Black Spruce (OBS) in the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study 
(BOREAS) Southern Study Area (SSA), while in 1994 attention was focused on jack 
pine tower flux and auxiliary sites in the SSA. LAI was estimated using both 
instruments; FPAR was obtained using the Ceptometer. Both the Ceptometer and the 
LAI-2000 rely on the relationships between radiation transmission, canopy gap 
fraction, and LAI. The assumptions of these approaches are summarized below (see 
Section 9) and have been assessed for the BOREAS sites in Chen et al. (1997).

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The Remote Sensing Science (RSS)-04 investigations were designed to obtain LAI, 
FPAR, and foliar chemistry data for a complex spatially variable forest canopy 
in order to:

   i) Parameterize an ecosystem simulation model.

  ii) Test empirical relationships hypothesized between biophysical 
      parameters and remotely sensed data.

 iii) Parameterize a forest reflectance model and compare it with Airborne
      Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data
      to deduce whether observed 'relationships' between canopy chemistry and 
      reflectance are a product of canopy structure rather than foliar chemical 
      variations themselves (see references list and biochemistry data set).

  iv) Drive the ecosystem simulation model with estimates of LAI and 
      chemistry derived from remotely sensed data.

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

i) LAI

Two instruments were used to estimate LAI: a LI-COR LAI-2000 leaf area meter and 
a Decagon Devices Ceptometer.  The LAI-2000 uses either one or two sensors to 
make measurements of the incoming diffuse incident flux above (A) and below (B) 
the canopy in blue wavelengths (<490 nm).  Each reading comprises measurements 
of the amount of radiation at five zenith angles simultaneously over either the 
full azimuth or some portion of it, dictated by a viewing mask attached to the 
optical head.  One measurement comprise a minimum of 10 numbers corresponding to 
5 values of A (above) and 5 of B (below), at zenith angles of 0, 22.5, 37.5, 
52.5, and 67.5 degrees.  The Ceptometer is a line quantum sensor consisting of 
80 separate photodiodes spaced at 1-cm intervals that are sensitive to radiation 
in the PAR region (400-700 nm).  Measurements above and below the canopy are 
made to determine canopy transmittance at a number of solar zenith angles.

ii) FPAR

The Ceptometer was also used to determine the fraction of PAR absorbed by the 
canopy at a number of solar zenith angles.

4.1.1 Collection Environment

Measurements were collected during ambient surface atmospheric conditions at the 
SSA during August 1993  (FFC-93) and July to August 1994 (IFC-2).  The LAI-2000 
measurements were made at dusk and dawn, Ceptometer data were collected on sunny 
days.

4.1.2 Source/Platform

The instruments were held by the human investigators.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

The objective was to collect LAI and FPAR measurements at various locations.

4.1.4 Key Variables

LAI, FPAR, Mean Tip Angle

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

The LAI-2000 and Ceptometer are instruments that make measurements of the 
incoming radiation below a plant canopy. In the case of the LAI-2000, 
measurements are made in the blue (<490 nm) region, while the Ceptometer records 
incoming radiation in the PAR (400-700 nm) region. These data can be used to 
estimate LAI indirectly by making assumptions about the canopy architecture 
(leaf distribution). LAI is derived by inverting the radiation transmission (or 
gap fraction) information. The gap fraction is the fraction of view in any 
direction from below a plant canopy that is not blocked (by leaves). If it is 
assumed that leaves are the only elements that block radiation, that they are 
nontransmitting, and that they are randomly distributed in space, then the 
transmission of a beam of radiation can be related to the mean foliage density 
(see Section 9 for equations). If the canopy is horizontally homogenous, then 
the mean foliage density can be related to LAI.

The LAI-2000 can be considered to be analogous to hemispherical photography in 
that it uses a fish eye light sensor that measures diffuse radiation in five 
distinct angular bands about zenith. The incoming radiation is projected onto 
photodiodes arranged as concentric rings. To derive gap fraction information, 
light conditions are assumed diffuse and uniform (dusk, dawn, or overcast 
conditions), and measurements are made of the sky above the canopy followed by 
readings below the canopy. The ratio of above-to-below canopy readings is used 
to obtain gap fraction. Because foliage is not normally randomly distributed and 
there is a proportion of nonfoliage matter that blocks radiation (dead leaves, 
branches, stems, or trunks), the derived measurement is normally referred to as 
ëeffectiveí LAI. Correction of these measurements can be made by derivation of 
factors that represent the woody-to-total area ratio and the clumping factors 
(needle-to-shoot area ratio and foliage clumping at greater than shoot level).

The Ceptometer measures PAR radiation using 80 photodiodes spaced at each 
centimeter along an 80-cm rod. These are used to provide an average value of PAR 
over the 80-cm length and for the specific solar zenith angle and relative 
azimuth. To account for azimuthal variation in foliage distribution, it is 
advisable to use the average over several azimuth directions (in this case, 
eight). Because the instrument is primarily used to measure the fraction of 
absorbed PAR (FPAR), measurements are taken in direct sun conditions, with the 
proviso that the solar illumination is consistent over the period of 
measurement. In the same way as with the LAI-2000, measurements are obtained 
first outside the canopy and subsequently below the canopy. In line with gap 
fraction measurements, these can be converted into an estimate of LAI using the 
approach of Norman (1988) (see Section 9). This also requires measurement of the 
ratio of diffuse-direct incident radiation. The diffuse component can be 
obtained by shading the Ceptometer from direct sun using an appropriately sized 
object such that the entire length of instrument is covered for the width of the 
solar disk (this is an acquired skill). More recent instruments (Delta-T 
SunScanô) come with a separate quantum sensor and shading ring for use with a 
line PAR sensor. Chen et al. (1997) indicate that the Ceptometer provides a 
measurement of plant area index, although the finite averaging does account for 
error caused by clumping at scales larger than the averaging length.

4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

LAI-2000

The LAI-2000 is simple to operate and acquires data relatively fast. Operation 
can be through single-head, dual-head, or remote-head modes. In single-head 
mode, as used in this experiment, both A (above) and B (below) measurements are 
made with the same optical head. Because the calculation is made by comparison 
of A and B measurements, the instrument does not require either absolute or 
relative calibration. However, there is a need for ready access to a clear sky 
view near to the measurement site. In BOREAS operation, this caused 
difficulties, especially at mature pine sites with tree heights of approximately 
15 m. Measurements had to be tailored to site conditions, and given the need to 
cover as many sites as possible, operation often occurred in nonoptimal 
conditions. Sites were measured at dawn or dusk, although the distance between 
sites limited coverage on any given day. For short tree sites, e.g., SSA-YJP, it 
was possible to get above the canopy (using the back of a standard Jeep or by 
climbing the flux tower in periods of nonoperation (1993) to a height of approx. 
3-4 m). The LAI-2000 head requires leveling, but if contains a bubble level to 
make leveling easier.  The best practice is to maintain instrument orientation 
for all measurements (A and B). This is particularly important where the 
availability of a clear area is restricted to a logging road. In such cases, the 
A reading was made from the back of a Jeep with the optical head masked downward 
such that only a proportion of the view was used (see Section 5). In all cases, 
the optical head was masked for the observer using a 45-degree mask unless more 
was required. A measurements were made as regularly as possible (before and 
after single B runs) to minimize the effect of variation in sky conditions and 
linear interpolation used to provide A values for each B value. Repetitions of 
each measurement were made to increase the representativeness, and in cases 
where the B value exceeded a corresponding A, the data point was ignored. This 
usually applied to measurements from the 5th ring. Removal of the 5th ring 
measurement in software meant that the data could be reintroduced. In all cases, 
the measurements were made at the same height, 1 m above the ground, except for 
reference measurements. The latter were made 1 m above the canopy (F8L6T), from 
the top of a large flux tower (G2L3T), or from a Jeep + 1 m height.

Ceptometer

As with the LAI-2000, there are a number of issues that affect the 
representativeness of measurements made with the Ceptometer. In all cases, 
reference measurements were made at the same locations as for the LAI-2000, and 
all measurement runs started and finished with a reference measurement. Since 
the same set of measurements was used for FPAR and LAI, these measurements were 
all made under direct sun conditions and included diffuse incident, canopy, and 
understory measurements. Each measurement comprised eight azimuth directions 
with the instrument level and out of any shadow cast by the operator. The eight 
measurements were made at the cardinal and subcardinal directions. Measurements 
were made at approximately 1 m where significant understory existed or 30 cm 
above ground where the understory was moss/lichen. Experience dictated whether a 
particular set of measurements was acceptable, especially for diffuse 
measurements, which required shading of the 80 photodiodes.  It should be noted 
that because each individual measurement (1 through 8) was averaged on the fly 
one unshaded diffuse measurement could bias the data. When this occurred, 
measurements were repeated. A measurement sequence took considerably longer than 
the equivalent LAI-2000, and the processing was more laborious because no 
software was written for this purpose.  This is now available with the Delta-T 
Sunscan and may be available with the Decagon Accupar.

4.2 Calibration

i) LAI-2000

Sensor calibration consists of five multipliers for the outputs of the five 
rings of the detector. These values are supplied on a calibration sheet and 
relate one ring to another. The values do not convert outputs to absolute values 
of energy. In one-sensor mode this is unimportant because the same sensor makes 
both A and B measurements. In two-sensor mode the two sensors are compared under 
the same diffuse light conditions to adjust the sensitivity of the two sensors. 
The instrument is calibrated using an integrating sphere supplied, by the UK 
representatives of LI-COR, Inc., Glen Spectra Ltd.

ii) Ceptometer

For LAI and FPAR determination, as long as the relative calibration of the 80 
sensors is consistent, the same method applies as above.  However, for 
determination of PAR, APAR, or incident PAR (PAR0), calibration must be applied 
to convert from output to SI units (µ mol m-2 s-1).  Calibration is checked 
regularly by the owners of the instrument, University of Wales, Swansea, by 
comparison against an accurate PAR sensor under a standard daylight lamp. The 
accurate PAR quantum sensor is traceable to UK national standards. 

4.2.1 Specifications

Ceptometer ñ The ideal spectral response for a quantum sensor is a top hat 
function with 100% dropoff at 400 nm and 700 nm. All quantum sensors approximate 
this; however, errors caused by imperfect spectral response are small for 
daylight conditions. The system cosine response matches the ideal accurately 
(>90% below 70 degrees).  Individual Ceptometer measurement time is nominally 
120 ms over a range of 2500 µ mol m-2 s-1 with a resolution of 0.3 µ mol m-2 s-1. 
Accuracy of the instrument is ±10%. Maximum recorded values were approximately 
1,500 µ mol m-2 s-1.

The LAI-2000 measurements were made in one-sensor mode because calculation is 
based on the ratio of A to B measurements. Issues of calibration, 
resolution, and accuracy are not a problem provided that the relative 
calibration between individual view rings is accurate and consistent.

4.2.1.1 Tolerance

Ceptometer - Accuracy of the instrument is ±10%. Maximum recorded values were 
approximately 1,500 µ mol m-2 s-1, well within the stated instrument range. 
Comparison of Ceptometer measurements against the Tracing Radiation and 
Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument indicated a discrepancy of 
approximately 200 counts, but this was consistent over a range of light 
conditions. Absolute values of PAR were therefore not reported. Error analysis 
for the FPAR measurements could not be conducted against those from other 
Principal Investigators (PIs) (Chen, RSS-07) because measurements were not 
coincident. Within canopy variability (n=10) indicates that for FPAR values 
greater than 0.7, an error of ±10% should be expected, but because of clumping 
this can rise to 20-30% for FPAR values of 0.5.

The LAI estimates from the Ceptometer, LAI-2000, TRAC, and allometry were 
assessed by Chen et al. (1997). All the methods have limitations, and an 
absolute accuracy could not be attributed to any one method. The error range for 
LAI measurement method is on the order of 15-30%. 

4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration

See Section 4 comments above ñ all measurements are ratio values, and the only 
issue is sensitivity of the instrument across the measurement range. This has 
not been checked but is assumed to be acceptable. Intercalibration between 
instruments was not performed for the LAI-2000 beause it was used in one-sensor 
mode. Comparison of Ceptometer measurements against the TRAC instrument 
indicated a discrepancy of approximately 200 counts, but this was consistent 
over a range of light conditions. Absolute values of PAR are not provided in 
this data set. 

4.2.3 Other Calibration Information

None given.

5. Data Acquisition Methods
 
1993 Procedure:

i) LAI using the LAI-2000

At each of the three conifer tower flux sites, 100-m transects were established 
with access to a nonforest area for determination of radiation flux.

At the SSA-YJP site, four transects were laid out on the cardinal points 
centered on the road next to the site hut (Figure 1).  Data acquisition 
comprised an A measurement followed by 10 B measurements for each transect and 
finished with additional A measurement. A samples were taken at the flux tower 
and B samples at 10-m intervals along each transect. Data were collected on 14-
Aug-1993 at 08:00 local time (15:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  All the A 
measurements were acquired above the canopy at 3-4 m using the steps on the flux 
tower. In all cases, a 45-degree view cap was used to eliminate the observer.


Figure 1. Transect locations at the SSA Young Jack Pine Site.

At the SSA-OJP site, suitable access to a clear area at the flux tower site to 
make irradiance measurements was not available.  Therefore, a similar stand 
adjacent to the site access road near a small lake (Figure 2) was selected. 
Irradiance measurements were taken at the lake edge using a 180-degree view cap.  
Four transects were established; however, the restricted size of the stand 
required a reorientation of these transects at some point along the 100-m 
length.  Data were acquired on 16-Aug-1993 at 05:20 (12:20 GMT) and 06:30 (13:30 
GMT).

Figure 2. Transect locations at the SSA Old Jack Pine Site.

Similarly, in the SSA-OBS, reasonable access to the flux tower site in 1993 was 
unavailable and there was no access above the canopy.  Transects were therefore 
established nearer the road, and the road served as the irradiance site with a 
315-degree view cap (Figure 3).  A transect was established in each of the two 
main strata types, tall, high LAI black spruce, and short, low LAI black spruce.  
Data were acquired every 5 meters to give a sample size of 20 for each transect. 
Data were recorded on 25-Aug-1993 at 13:30 (20:30 GMT).


Figure 3. Transect locations for the SSA Old Black Spruce Site.

LAI was calculated using options available in the LAI-2000 processing software. 
Four different methods were used: standard, slope/intercept (Lang, 1987), 
ellipsoidal leaf distribution (Campbell, 1986), and constrained least squares 
(Norman and Campbell, 1989). 

ii) LAI using the Ceptometer

At the same sites as in i), measurements were made several times per day.  Each 
measurement on a transect was the average of eight azimuthal measurements of PAR 
flux.  Total and diffuse incident flux were measured before and after each 
transect using a shade to block the sun.  Similarly, at the first and last 
transect point, diffuse within-canopy flux and PAR reflected by the understory 
were measured.  LAI was determined empirically using the method described by 
Norman (1988) with the beam fraction determined by interpolation for each 
transect point (see Section 9).

iii) FPAR

The measurements described above for the Ceptometer were also used to calculate 
the variation in FPAR for each transect using measurements of canopy 
transmission and interpolated values of incident flux and soil reflected flux. 
The canopy reflected flux was calculated using an average of eight measurements 
of a short roadside tree.  FPAR was calculated for three solar zenith angles and 
for two transects at each site.

1994 Procedure:

i) LAI with the LAI-2000

The data acquisition in 1994 concentrated on the jack pine tower and auxiliary 
sites in the SSA and covered the same transects/plots as those laid out by RSS-
07 and Terrestrial Ecology (TE)-23 for allometric measurements. For each 
auxiliary site, this comprised two perpendicular 50-m transects oriented in due 
S-N and E-W directions. Deviation from such an arrangement is explained in 
Section 6.

A total of nine jack pine sites were sampled with the LAI-2000.  In all cases, 
the data were acquired either before sunrise or after sunset and with a large 
view cap (315 or 330 degrees) because the only irradiance site in most cases was 
the access road.  Tree edge effects were reduced by measuring irradiance from 
the top of a Jeep.

ii) LAI with the Ceptometer

Ceptometer data were acquired at the same sites as the LAI-2000 using the method 
described above for 1994 site locations.  Ten sites were covered, with runs 
recorded at three solar zenith angles for seven of the sites and two solar 
zenith angles for the other three sites.  In addition, a series of comparative 
analyses was conducted with Jing Chen (RSS-07) at the following sites: SSA-Young 
Aspen (YA) (D6H4T), Black Spruce (D0H6S) and Mixed (D9I1M) and with Don Deering 
(RSS-01) at the SSA-OJP.

iii) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR)

Measurements of FPAR for each of the sites above were also made using the method 
described in 1993.  At sites with significant understory vegetation, additional 
measurements were made above and below the understory (D6H4T, D0H6S).

iv) Canopy Chemistry

Samples for determination of nitrogen, chlorophyll, water, etc., were acquired 
for the nine sites covered by the LAI-2000 using clippers for the short sites 
and with a shotgun for the sites with tall canopies.  Branchlets were subdivided 
into current year and 1 year or greater, and the needles were then stripped off 
and frozen with CO2 (see related data sets Section 1.6).

7.1.3 Spatial Resolution

The measurements provided by the LAI-2000 should be regarded as representative 
of the sample site, while those by the Ceptometer (LAI and FPAR) are provided as 
individual samples for each sample point. It is recommended that these also be 
used at the sample site level rather than individually since the variation from 
point to point can be large because of clumping; this is particularly important 
in the case of FPAR.  Where there was significant understory, the Ceptometer

7.2.3 Temporal Resolution

Measurements were made during FFC-93 and IFC-2 in 1994. LAI changes relatively 
slowly for conifer species; hence, the values can be considered to be 
representative of the field campaign specified. FPAR varies continuously, for a 
given location, as a function of solar geometry because penetration is dependent 
on the interception of incident PAR by individual crowns clumped in a nonrandom 
fashion. Three sets of measurements for each sample site are given along with 
time and date to provide an indication of FPAR variability. Individual runs of 
measurements took approximately 10 minutes from first point to last plus the 
time taken to gain access to the site from the nearest clear sky location 
(varied from 1-10 minutes with most sites less than 5 minutes).

are shown in the companion data definition file (r04laifd.def).

9. Data Manipulations

9.1 Formulae

LAI-2000 method:

In calculation of LAI with the LAI-2000, the foliage density is derived by 
measurement of the contact frequency over the azimuthal averaged zenith bin 
represented by each viewing ring. Foliage density is calculated as:

µ = 2?-ln(T(?))sin?/S(?) d?

where T(?) is the probability of noninterception, ? is zenith angle, and S(?) is 
the path length.  If there is a homogeneous cover, foliage density µ is related 
to LAI by canopy height and path length S is dependent on canopy height and 
zenith angle:

LAI = µz and S(?) = z/cos(?)

Thus, LAI can be calculated by summation of the azimuthal averaged transmission 
over the five zenith bins:

LAI = 2? -ln(T(?))sin?cos?


For boreal forest canopies where the cover is not homogeneous (i.e., the foliage 
distribution is not random, and a proportion of the intercepting elements are 
not foliage), the measurement is of effective LAI (see Chen et al., 1997). To 
derive LAI, it is necessary to adjust the effective LAI for the woody-to-total 
area ratio and the foliage clumping both within conifer shoots and at large 
scales. A discussion of the derivation of such correction factors is given in 
Chen et al. (1997), with values provided for the tower flux sites.
 
Ceptometer Method:

The derivation of LAI from Ceptometer measurements uses the formula derived by 
Norman (1988) to convert from PAR transmission to LAI. This approach was derived 
from simulation results from a radiative transfer model under assumptions of a 
spherical leaf angle distribution and random leaf positioning. It does not 
involve gap fraction analysis and can be used with any beam fraction from clear 
sky to overcast. Although it does not require a series of solar angles, 
averaging across a range of solar zenith angles is recommended. The empirical 
fit of LAI to PAR transmission is:

LAI = [{fb(1-cos??s?????ln(Ei/Ea)]/(0.72-0.337fb)

fb = (Ea- Ead)/Ea

where fb is the beam fraction, EI is incident PAR under the canopy, Ea is 
incident PAR above the canopy, Ead is the diffuse incident PAR, and ?s is solar 
zenith angle.

Descriptions of these and other methods of LAI estimation can be found in the 
cited literature (Section 17.2) and a review by Welles (1990).

FPAR is calculated using the following formula:

FPAR = (PAR0 - PARr - (PARt - PARs ))/PAR0

The subscripts 0, r, t, and s refer to the incoming PAR, PAR reflected by the 
canopy, PAR transmitted through the canopy, and PAR reflected by the substrate, 
respectively.  The measurements in all cases are the average of eight azimuthal 
measurements to eliminate azimuthal bias.

9.2.1 Processing Steps

See Section 9.1.

9.2.2 Processing Changes

None.

9.3 Calculations

i) LAI from LAI-2000

LAI was calculated using the LAI-2000 operating in one-sensor mode with one run 
constituting 10 B measurements separated by A measurements at the start and end 
of each run.  Linear interpolation between the A values was used to calculate A 
values for each B measurement.  B values were rejected if the B:A ratio was 
greater than 1 in any of the five rings.

ii) LAI from Ceptometer

Determined using the method of Norman (1988), a typical Ceptometer run 
comprised: 

Total incoming
Diffuse incoming
Canopy
Measurement 1
Substrate at Measurement 1
Diffuse at Measurement 1
Measurement 2
Measurement 3....
Measurement 10
Total incoming
Diffuse incoming

Linear interpolation based on time (decimal) for Total and Diffuse incoming was 
used to calculate incoming for each measurement.  Solar zenith angle was 
calculated based on the time and site latitude/longitude obtained from the 
BOREAS Auxiliary Site Guide.

iii) FPAR from Ceptometer

FPAR calculations used the same data set and methods as ii) to determine the 
incoming. The canopy and substrate components were as a percentage of incoming 
at each sample point.

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

None given.

10.2 Quality Assessment

10.2.1 Data Validation by Source

Checks were made prior to storage to make sure anomalous values were not stored. 
In the case of LAI-2000, measurements were acquired only before sunrise and 
after sunset and in the absence of significant amounts of cloud, or where the 
cloud was fast moving. Measurements were redone if the number of invalid data 
points (indicated by an instrument beep) was higher than 2 on a standard run. 
These data sets were discarded.

Similarly, where a single Ceptometer measurement contributing to the average was 
unexpectedly high or low, for example in the case of diffuse measurements, where 
the shadowing device was not completely over the instrument, the average was 
recalculated using an additional eight samples. 

10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment

It is difficult to draw conclusions on the subjective quality of the data; 
however, it is clear that such estimates are only as good as the assumptions 
made in derivation. The Chen et al. (1997) paper discusses these assumptions for 
LAI and compares a range of instrument measurements. The cause and effects of 
error on the representativeness of measurements varies with instrument and tree 
species, and particularly with clumping at a range of scales. Nevertheless, the 
estimates are consistent with alternative approaches.

10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters

Error in LAI from LAI-2000 and Ceptometer from Chen et al. (1997) varies with 
tree species, but is in the range of 15-30%. This error is comparable but not 
necessarily the same as for allometry.

Error (n=10) in FPAR varies with the degree of clumping in a canopy but is 
typically less than 10% for FPAR of greater than 0.7. The error increases and 
may reach 30% where the canopy is highly variable. There is no consistent 
pattern in error variation with solar geometry.

10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments

None given.

11. Notes

11.1 Limitations of the Data

None given.

11.2 Known Problems with the Data

i) LAI from LAI-2000

The data set is exclusively of an incomplete conifer canopy. The assumptions in 
translating from transmission to LAI may not strictly apply. In particular, the 
assumption of random arrangement of needles in space is not true, which leads to 
underestimation of LAI. An empirical correction to convert from shoot projected 
area to needle projected area has been suggested to adjust for this effect 
(Gower and Norman, 1990). These empirical corrections, however, have not been 
applied to the data. Representative correction values can be found in Chen et 
al. (1997), along with a discussion of their use.

The irradiance measurement was constrained by access to an open area. In most 
cases, this was the road. Edge effects were reduced by limiting the view azimuth 
and standing on a raised platform; however, it is anticipated that there may 
still be some influence caused by the reduction in representativeness of the 
azimuth average.

ii) LAI from Ceptometer

The azimuth averages of incoming PAR could potentially be biased by the presence 
of tree trunks or gaps near the sample point. Variations in averages were noted 
by repeated sampling near the central grid point. Absolute values of PAR are not 
given because cross comparison with the TRAC instrument (Chen et al. 1997)(RSS-
7) revealed a consistent discrepancy of approximately 230 counts.

iii) FPAR from Ceptometer

All values were calculated as an average of eight azimuth measurements. In the 
case of canopy and substrate measurements, low incoming values resulted in null 
returns as an average. In these cases, the percentage reflectance was derived 
from repeat measurements of the site.

The canopy measurement was not derived under ideal conditions because it was not 
possible to obtain PAR reflectance from the real canopy. Measurements of short 
trees at the roadside were substituted. The average values were not azimuth 
independent because of problems with the bias introduced from direct irradiance 
incident on the Ceptometer in the antisolar direction; therefore,.canopy values 
may not be truly representative.

The average values were computed and stored by the instrument, so no record of 
the eight values that generated the average is available.
