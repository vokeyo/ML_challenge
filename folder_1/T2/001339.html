<P><B>Standards of Learning (SOL) Test Blueprint</B>
<P><B>Introduction</B>
<P><B>What is a test blueprint?</B>
<P>A test blueprint is a guide for test construction and use. The Standards of Learning (SOL) test blueprints serve a number of purposes. One, they serve as a guide to test developers as they write test questions and construct the SOL tests. Two, they serve as a guide to educators, parents and students in that they show (a) the SOLs covered by the test and which, if any, have been excluded; (b) which SOLs are assigned to each reporting category; (c) the number of test items in each reporting category and on the total test; (d) general information about how the test questions were constructed; and (e) the materials that students are allowed to use while taking the test.
<P><B>How is the test blueprint organized?</B>
<P>There is a blueprint for each test (e.g., grade 3 English, grade 5 mathematics, grade 8 science, U.S. History). Each blueprint contains the following information:
<P><B>1.</B><B> </B><B><U>Test Development Guidelines</U></B><B>:</B> guidelines used by Harcourt Brace Educational Measurement and the members of the Content Review Committees in developing the SOL tests. This section contains three parts:
<BR>
<P>A. <U>General Considerations</U> &#151; lists general considerations that were used in developing the test as well as considerations specific to a particular content area.
<BR>
<P>B. <U>Item Format</U> &#151; lists information on how items for the test are constructed.
<BR>
<P>C. <U>Ancillary Materials</U> &#151; lists any materials (e.g., calculators, rulers, protractors, compasses, dictionaries) that students are allowed to use while taking each test.
<BR>
<P><B>2.</B><B> </B><B><U>Blueprint Summary Table</U></B><B>:</B> a summary of the blueprint which displays the following information:
<P>&#149; reporting categories for each test;
<P>&#149; number of test items in each reporting category;
<P>&#149; Standards of Learning (SOLs) included in each reporting category. SOLs are identified by numbers and letters that correspond to the original SOL document (letters are assigned to the &quot;bullets&quot; in the original document);
<P>&#149; SOLs which are excluded from the SOL test;
<P>&#149; number of operational items on the test;
<P>&#149; number of field-test items on the test; and
<P>&#149; total number of items (operational and field-test items) on the test.
<P><B>3.</B> <B><U>Expanded Blueprint</U></B><B>:</B> provides the same information as the <U>Blueprint Summary Table</U> except that the full text of each SOL is included. In addition, SOLs that are excluded from the test are categorized by the reason they were not included.
<P><B>What is a reporting category?</B>
<P>Each test covers a number of SOLs. In the test blueprint, SOLs are grouped into categories that address related content or skills. These categories are labeled Reporting Categories. For example, a Reporting Category for the Grade 5 Mathematics test is &quot;Computation and Estimation.&quot; Each of the SOLs in this reporting category addresses computation using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division or require the student to estimate the answer to a problem. When the results of the SOL tests are reported, the scores will be presented in terms of scores for each Reporting Category and a total test score.
<P><B>Are some SOLs assigned to more than one reporting category?</B>
<P>&quot;Bullets&quot; under a particular SOL are sometimes coded to different reporting categories. For example, the Science SOL 2.7a which deals with the effects that weather and seasonal changes have on the growth and behavior of living things is assigned to the reporting category &quot;Life Processes and Living Systems&quot; in the Grade 3 Science test. However, SOL 2.7b which deals with the effects of weather and seasonal changes on weathering and erosion of the land surface is assigned to the reporting category &quot;Earth/Space Systems and Cycles.&quot; Each &quot;bullet&quot; is assigned to only one reporting category.
<P><B>Why are some SOLs not tested on the SOL tests?</B>
<P>In some content areas, there are SOLs that do not lend themselves to multiple-choice testing. For example, in English, the oral language SOLs cannot be appropriately assessed in a multiple-choice format. In other cases, an SOL listed in one content area is covered by a similar SOL in another content area. For example, English SOL 4.9 which addresses the use of available technology to research a topic is covered by a similar SOL at grade 5 (Computer/Technology SOL C/T 5.3).
<P>At the end of the blueprint for each test, the SOLs not tested are listed in &quot;SOLs Excluded from Testing.&quot; In the expanded blueprint the SOLs excluded from testing are categorized by the reason they are not being tested.
<P><B>Will all SOLs listed in the blueprint be assessed each time the SOL tests are given?</B>
<P>Due to the large number of SOLs in a content area for a grade span, <I>every</I> SOL will not be assessed on every SOL test form. By necessity, to keep the length of a test reasonable, each test will sample from the SOLs within a reporting category. However, every SOL is eligible for inclusion on each form of an SOL test.
<P><B>Grade 8: Mathematics </B>
<P><B>Test Development Guidelines</B>
<P><B>A. General Considerations</B>
<P>1. All items included in this test will address the knowledge and skills specified in the 1995 Virginia Standards of Learning in mathematics for grades 6-8.  
<P>2. The items will be free of stereotyping or bias directed at a particular age, gender, economic status, racial, ethnic or religious group, or geographic region.
<P>3. The test will be untimed.
<P>4. There is no penalty for guessing.  Students will be scored on the number of correct answers out of the total number of operational items on the test. 
<P>5. Where appropriate, &quot;real-life&quot; examples and situations that the student would likely encounter will be used to present data or ask questions<I> </I>
<P>6. Items will be grade-appropriate in terms of difficulty, interest, and reading level. 
<P>7. Students will be permitted scratch paper at any time during the test.
<P>8. Students will be permitted to use 4-function calculators during the test.
<P>9. Students will be permitted to use standard (e.g., inches) and metric rulers during the test.
<P>10. Students will be provided a formula sheet and an approximation for pi.  A copy of the formula sheet follows the expanded blueprint.  
<P><B>B. Item Format</B>
<P>1. Each item will be a multiple-choice item containing four choices.  Choices such as &quot;None of the above&quot;, &quot;All of the above&quot;, and &quot;Not here&quot; will <B>not</B> be used.  
<P>2. Answer choices will be arranged vertically beneath the item stems unless space considerations prevent such an arrangement.
<P>3. Item stems will be in the form of questions or in the form of sentences that require completion.
<P>4. Answer choices will be arranged in ascending or descending order, when appropriate.
<P>5. Graphic displays, item stems, and answer choices will all appear on the same page.
<P>6. In most cases, numbers will be expressed as numerals.
<P>7. Commas will be used in numerals of 4 or more digits.
<P>8. Any decimal fraction less than 1 will include a leading zero.
<P>9. Measurement of area and volume in standard units (e.g., inches, feet)will be of the form: sq unit, cu unit (e.g., sq in., cu ft).
<P>10. Measurement of area and volume in metric units (e.g., centimeters, kilometers) will be of the form: unit<SUP>2</SUP> and unit<SUP>3</SUP> (e.g., cm<SUP>2</SUP>, km<SUP>3</SUP>).
<P>11. The symbol for subtraction will be differentiated from the symbol for a negative number (e.g., 3 &#150; 7 = <SUP>&#150;</SUP>4).
<P>12. Graphs will include no more than 7 categories.
<P><B>C. Ancillary Materials</B>
<P>1. Ruler
