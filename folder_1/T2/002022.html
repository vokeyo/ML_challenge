      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Presidential Inauguration Day</h3>
      <p>Federal employees in the Washington, DC, area are entitled to a holiday 
        on the day a President is inaugurated (January 20 following a Presidential 
        election). Employees are entitled to this holiday if they are employed 
        in &#151;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>the District of Columbia;</li>
        <li>Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in Maryland;</li>
        <li>Arlington and Fairfax Counties in Virginia; and</li>
        <li>the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church in Virginia.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When Inauguration Day is moved to January 21<sup>st</sup> because January 
        20<sup>th </sup>falls on Sunday, Federal employees in the Washington, 
        DC, area who would otherwise work on Monday, January 21<sup>st</sup>, 
        are entitled to a holiday on that day.</p>
      <a name="InLieuofHolidays"></a> 
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">&quot;In Lieu of&quot; Holidays</h3>
      <p>All full-time employees, including those on flexible or compressed work 
        schedules, are entitled to an &quot;in lieu of&quot; holiday when a holiday 
        falls on a nonworkday. In such cases, the employee's holiday is the basic 
        workday immediately preceding the nonworkday. A basic workday for this 
        purpose includes a day when part of the basic work requirement for an 
        employee under a flexible work schedule is planned or scheduled to be 
        performed.</p>
      <p>There are three exceptions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If the nonworkday is Sunday (or an &quot;in lieu of&quot; Sunday), 
          the next basic workday is the &quot;in lieu of&quot; holiday. (See section 
          3 of E.O. 11582, February 11, 1971.)</li>
        <li>If Inauguration Day falls on a nonworkday, there is no provision for 
          an &quot;in lieu of&quot; holiday.</li>
        <li>If the head of an agency determines that a different &quot;in lieu 
          of&quot; holiday is necessary to prevent an &quot;adverse agency impact,&quot; 
          he or she may designate a different &quot;in lieu of&quot; holiday for 
          full-time employees under compressed work schedules. (See 5 U.S.C. 6131(b).)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>An employee is not entitled to another day off as an &quot;in lieu of&quot; 
        holiday if a Federal office or facility is closed on a holiday because 
        of a weather emergency or when employees are furloughed on a holiday.</p>
      <p><a name="twoholidaysonepaypd"></a></p>
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Two Holidays in One Pay Period</h3>
      <p>Occasionally, two holidays will fall within the same pay period. A full-time 
        employee on a flexible work schedule is entitled to 8 hours of pay on 
        a holiday when the employee does not work. (See 5 U.S.C. 6124.) Therefore, 
        when two 8-hour holidays fall within the same pay period, full-time employees 
        on a 5/4-9 flexible schedule (or other flexible schedules under which 
        employees work more than 8 hours a day) must make arrangements to work 
        extra hours during other regularly scheduled workdays (or take annual 
        leave or use credit hours or compensatory time off) in order to fulfill 
        the 80-hour biweekly work requirement.</p>
      <a name="HolidaysforEmployeesOutsidetheUnitedStates"></a> 
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Holidays for Employees Outside the United States</h3>
      <p>Holidays designated by law to occur on Monday (i.e., Birthday of Martin 
        Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and 
        Columbus Day) are moved to Sundays for employees at duty posts outside 
        the United States who are regularly scheduled to work on Monday. This 
        applies to employees whose basic workweek is Sunday through Thursday. 
        However, it does not apply to employees whose basic workweek is Monday 
        through Friday or Monday through Saturday.</p>
      <p>This rule does not apply to &quot;in lieu of&quot; holidays. (See 5 U.S.C. 
        6103(b)(3).)</p>
      <a name="PresidentialClosingofAgencies"></a> 
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Presidential Closing of Agencies</h3>
      <p>Presidents occasionally issue Executive orders closing Federal departments 
        and agencies for part or all of a workday. Employees are excused from 
        duty during such periods unless they are &quot;emergency employees,&quot; 
        as determined by their agencies. Such Executive orders often provide that 
        the time off will be treated like a holiday for pay and leave purposes. 
        Employees who are required to work during their basic tour of duty on 
        such days are entitled to holiday premium pay.</p>
      <a name="ToursOnAHoliday"></a> 
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Tours On A Holiday</h3>
      <p>A basic (nonovertime) tour of duty that includes some, but not all, hours 
        on a holiday is considered a holiday tour. (See section 5 of E.O. 11582, 
        February 11, 1971, and B-202626, September 4, 1984.)</p>
      <p>When two basic (nonovertime) tours of duty include hours on a holiday, 
        the holiday tour is the tour of duty that begins on the holiday. (See 
        section 5 of E.O. 11582, February 11, 1971.)</p>
      <a name="PayonaHoliday"></a>

      <a name="Full-timeEmployees"></a> 
      <h2 style=font-size:13pt>Pay on a Holiday</h2>
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Full-time Employees</h3>
      <p>Full-time employees who are not required to work on a holiday receive 
        their rate of basic pay for the applicable number of holiday hours.</p>
      <p>Standard (40-Hour/5-Day Week) Work Schedules. On a holiday, employees 
        under a standard work schedule are generally excused from 8 hours of nonovertime 
        work, which are considered part of the 40-hour basic workweek.</p>
      <p>Flexible Work Schedules. On a holiday, employees under flexible work 
        schedules are credited with 8 hours towards their 80-hour basic work requirement 
        for the pay period. Employees under flexible work schedules are credited 
        with 8 holiday hours even if they would otherwise work more hours on that 
        day.&nbsp; In the event the President issues an Executive order granting 
        a &quot;half-day&quot; holiday, a full-time employee on a flexible work 
        schedule is credited with half the number of hours he or she was scheduled 
        to work, not to exceed 4 hours. &nbsp;(See 5 U.S.C. 6124 and the definition 
        of &quot;basic work requirement&quot; in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3).)</p>
      <p>Compressed Work Schedules. On a holiday, employees under compressed work 
        schedules are generally excused from all of the nonovertime hours they 
        would otherwise work on that day and which apply to their &quot;basic 
        work requirement.&quot; For example, if a holiday falls on a 9- or 10-hour 
        basic workday, the employee's holiday is 9 or 10 hours, respectively.&nbsp; 
        In the event the President issues an Executive order granting a &quot;half-day&quot; 
        holiday, a full-time employee on a compressed work schedule is entitled 
        to basic pay for half the number of hours he or she would otherwise work 
        on that day. &nbsp;(See 5 CFR 610.406(a).)</p>
      <a name="Part-timeEmployees"></a> 
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Part-time Employees</h3>
      <p>A part-time employee is entitled to a holiday when the holiday&nbsp; 
        falls on a day when he or she would otherwise be required to work or take 
        leave. This does not include overtime work.</p>
      <p>Part-time employees who are excused from work on a holiday receive their 
        rate of basic pay for the hours they are regularly scheduled to work on 
        that day.</p>
      <p>Standard (40-Hour/5-Day Week) Work Schedules. On a holiday, part-time 
        employees under standard work schedules are generally excused from duty 
        for the number of basic (nonovertime) hours they are regularly scheduled 
        to work on that day, not to exceed 8 hours.</p>
      <p>Flexible Work Schedules. On a holiday, part-time employees under a flexible 
        work schedule are generally excused from duty for the number of hours 
        of their &quot;basic work requirement&quot; (i.e., nonovertime hours) 
        on that day, not to exceed 8 hours. (See 5 CFR 610.405.) In the event 
        the President issues an Executive order granting a &quot;half-day&quot; 
        holiday, a part-time employee on a flexible work schedule is generally 
        excused from duty for half the number of hours in his or her &quot;basic 
        work requirement&quot; on that day, not to exceed 4 hours.</p>
      <p>Compressed work schedules. On a holiday, part-time employees under a 
        compressed work schedule are generally excused from all of the hours of 
        their compressed work schedules (i.e., &quot;basic work requirement&quot;) 
        on that day. (See 5 CFR 610.406(b).) In the event the President issues 
        an Executive order granting a &quot;half-day&quot; holiday, a part-time 
        employee on a compressed work schedule is generally excused from half 
        of the hours of his or her compressed work schedule on that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>If a holiday falls on a nonworkday, part-time employees are not entitled 
        to an &quot;in lieu of&quot; holiday. If an agency's office or facility 
        is closed due to an &quot;in lieu of&quot; holiday for full-time employees, 
        the agency may grant paid excused absence to part-time employees who are 
        otherwise scheduled to work on that day. (63 Comp. Gen. 306 (1984).)</p>
      <a name="HolidayWork"></a> 
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Holiday Work</h3>
      <p>&quot;Holiday work&quot; means nonovertime work performed by employees 
        during their regularly scheduled daily tour of duty on a holiday. (See 
        5 CFR 550.103.)</p>
      <a name="HolidayPremiumPay"></a> 
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Holiday Premium Pay</h3>
      <p>For each hour of holiday work, employees receive holiday premium pay. 
        Holiday premium pay is equal to an employee's rate of basic pay. Employees 
        who are required to work on a holiday receive their rate of basic pay, 
        plus holiday premium pay, for each hour of holiday work. (See 5 U.S.C. 
        5546(b).)</p>
      <p>Employees who are required to perform any work during basic (nonovertime) 
        holiday hours are entitled to a minimum of 2 hours of holiday premium 
        pay. (See 5 U.S.C. 5546(c).)</p>
      <p>Standard (40-Hour/5 Day Week) Work Schedules. Employees are entitled 
        to holiday premium pay if they are required to work on a holiday during 
        their regularly scheduled nonovertime basic tours of duty, not to exceed 
        8 hours.</p>
      <p>Flexible Work Schedules. Employees under flexible work schedules are 
        entitled to holiday premium pay if they are required to work during the 
        hours of their &quot;basic work requirement&quot; (i.e., nonovertime hours) 
        on that day, not to exceed 8 hours. In the event the President issues 
        an Executive order granting a &quot;half-day&quot; holiday, part-time 
        employees on a flexible work schedule are entitled to holiday premium 
        pay if they are required to work during the last half of their &quot;basic 
        work requirement&quot; (i.e., nonovertime hours) on that day, not to exceed 
        4 hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>Compressed Work Schedules. Employees under compressed work schedules 
        are entitled to holiday premium pay if they are required to work during 
        their &quot;basic work requirement&quot; on that day. The number of hours 
        of holiday premium pay may not exceed the hours in an employee's compressed 
        work schedule for that day (e.g., 8, 9, or 10 nonovertime hours). (See 
        5 CFR 610.407.)&nbsp; In the event the President issues an Executive order 
        granting a &quot;half-day&quot; holiday, part-time employees on a compressed 
        work schedule are entitled to holiday premium pay if they are required 
        to work during the last half of their &quot;basic work requirement&quot; 
        (i.e., nonovertime hours) on that day.</p>
      <p>Part-time employees do not receive holiday premium pay for working on 
        an &quot;in lieu of&quot; holiday for full-time employees.</p>

      <h2 style=font-size:13pt>Overtime on Holidays</h2>
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Overtime Work on a Holiday</h3>
      <p>Standard (40-Hour/5-Day Week) Work Schedules. Overtime work on a holiday 
        is work in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week. This also 
        applies to part-time employees.</p>
      <p>Flexible Work Schedules. Overtime work on a holiday for employees under 
        flexible work schedules is work in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours 
        in a week that is officially ordered in advance. (See 5 U.S.C. 6121(6).)</p>
      <p>Compressed Work Schedules. Overtime work on a holiday for an employee 
        under a compressed work schedule is hours of work in excess of the employee's 
        compressed work schedule (e.g., 8-, 9-, or 10-hour &quot;basic work requirement&quot;) 
        on that day. (See 5 U.S.C. 6121(7).)</p>
      <p>Holiday hours, hours of paid leave, use of accrued compensatory time 
        off or credit hours, and hours of excused absence with pay are credited 
        as hours of work towards the overtime pay standards. For example, these 
        hours are credited when determining whether an employee has worked in 
        excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week under a standard or flexible 
        work schedule. (See 5 CFR 550.112(c) and 5 CFR 551.401(b).)</p>
      <p>Employees are not excused from overtime work on a holiday because of 
        the holiday.</p>
      <a name="OvertimePayOnaHoliday"></a> 
      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Overtime Pay On a Holiday</h3>
      <p>Employees are entitled to overtime pay, or compensatory time off, when 
        applicable, if the agency requires overtime work on a holiday.</p>
      <p>Overtime work must generally be ordered or approved. However, employees 
        who are covered by the overtime pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards 
        Act of 1938, as amended (FLSA), also are entitled to overtime pay if overtime 
        work is &quot;suffered or permitted&quot; by a supervisor. One exception 
        is that no &quot;suffered and permitted&quot; hours of work can be credited 
        to employees under flexible work schedules.</p>
      <p>Overtime work does not include credit hours worked voluntarily (earned) 
        under a flexible work schedule. (See 5 U.S.C. 6121(6).)</p>

      <p>Employees are entitled to night pay for regularly scheduled work at night, 
        including actual work performed at night during holiday hours or overtime 
        hours. Night pay is paid in addition to holiday premium pay or overtime 
        pay. (See 5 CFR 550.122(c).)</p>
      <p>Employees also are entitled to night pay when they are excused from regularly 
        scheduled night work during holiday hours. A General Schedule employee 
        who is excused from night work during holiday hours receives his or her 
        rate of basic pay plus night pay. (See 5 CFR 550.122(a).) Night shift 
        differential is part of basic pay for Federal Wage System employees. (See 
        5 CFR 532.505(b).)</p>

      <h3 style="font-size:10pt; color:navy;">Sunday Work</h3>
      <p>An employee is entitled to holiday premium pay and Sunday premium pay 
        if he or she is required to work during holiday hours on Sunday and Sunday 
        work is part of the employee's regularly scheduled basic workweek (or 
        basic work requirement). If an employee does not work during the holiday 
        hours on Sunday, the employee receives basic pay for the holiday hours, 
        but is not entitled to Sunday premium pay. This is because Sunday premium 
        pay cannot be paid unless an employee actually performs work on Sunday. 
        (See section 624 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations 
        Act, 1999; 5 U.S.C. 5546(a) and 6128(c); and 5 CFR 550.172.)</p>
