<b>Historic Keyser Mansion to be Redeveloped</b><p>&nbsp;<br>

<font size="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KEYSER <i>(September 14, 2000)</i> -- A 19th century mansion that overlooks U.S. 220 will be restored for use as a Mineral County history and culture center, Congressman Alan B. Mollohan announced today.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollohan, D-W.Va., said the structure -- known as Carskadon Mansion -- is being purchased and redeveloped through a collaboration between the Mineral County Historical Society and the Vandalia Heritage Foundation, which he established two years ago.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carskadon Mansion is among the most notable buildings in an area that is itself rich in history.  As such, it will make an ideal home for local historical collections and, we hope, also can serve as host to community gatherings and events," Mollohan said.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He complimented the Mineral historical group on its efforts to buy the structure.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Jack Sanders, who is an avid historian and genealogist, told me of the society's interest in the mansion, it struck me as a prime candidate for assistance from Vandalia," Mollohan recalled.  "He, along with society President Frank Roleff and member Kermit Garretson, have been instrumental in moving this project forward through their own efforts and through close cooperation with Vandalia's project manager, Laura Kuhns.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preserving and redeveloping this structure is an exciting prospect and I'm very pleased that Vandalia is teaming with the community to make it a reality.  Laura Kuhns is quite skilled in the field of historic renovations and I know that she will continue to be a great resource for Carskadon, not to mention other Vandalia projects throughout the region," Mollohan said.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollohan created the Vandalia foundation to help northern West Virginia communities preserve their historic structures.  It purchased Carskadon Mansion last month from the estate of the late Dr. Thomas P. From, a Mineral County veterinarian.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the sale, Vandalia provided one-half of the $50,000 purchase price.  The Mineral County Historical Foundation -- which was established to help the society raise funds and acquire the building -- has six months to come up with the remaining $25,000.  When it does, Vandalia will transfer the property to the local group.  Vandalia will continue to assist with the mansion's rehabilitation after the transfer is complete.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roleff said, "The Mineral County Historical Society and Foundation would like to thank Congressman Mollohan and the Vandalia Foundation for this fantastic opportunity to preserve one of Mineral County's outstanding landmarks.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our plans include the complete restoration of the mansion and the establishment of a regional family history research center," Roleff added, noting that the facility will be open for tours and for special events.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mansion was the home of Thomas R. Carskadon who, according to a Bicentennial "List of the '76' Outstanding Individuals From Mineral County," was a "farmer, stockman and a fluent public speaker."  He was a member of the West Virginia Constitutional Convention, U.S. assessor of the Second West Virginia District, presidential elector for Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, vice presidential candidate on the 1892 Prohibition ticket and a member of the Mineral County Court.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born in 1837 and died in 1905.<p>
