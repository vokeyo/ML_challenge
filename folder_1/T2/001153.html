<p><font face="Arial">A generic drug is a copy of a brand name drug. It works the same as the brand 
  name drug.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" color="#6600CC">Are generic drugs safe? Yes</font></h3>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li><font face="Arial">The FDA requires that all drugs be safe and effective. Generics use the 
  same substances and work the same way in the body as brand name drugs. So they 
  have the same risks and benefits as the brand name drug. </font> </li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" color="#6600CC">Are they as strong as brand name drugs? Yes</font></h3>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li><font face="Arial">The FDA demands that generic drugs be just as strong, pure, and stable as 
  brand name drugs. They must also be the same quality. </font> </li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" color="#6600CC">Will they take longer to work in my body? No.</font></h3>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li><font face="Arial">Generics work in the same way and in the same amount of time as brand name 
  drugs. </font> </li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" color="#6600CC">Why are they cheaper?</font></h3>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li><font face="Arial">New drugs are developed under
patents. A patent gives only that
one company the right to sell the
drug for a period of time. This
protects those who create the
drug and pay to research, develop,
and market it.</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Other companies can apply to the
FDA to sell a generic when the
patent is about to expire. Generic
companies do not have the same
up-front costs to research and
develop the drug. They can sell
their drug at a lower cost because
their makers don’t have the costs
of creating the new drug.
  </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Also, once generic drugs are
approved, there are more people
trying to sell the drug. This keeps
the price down.</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Today, almost half of all prescriptions are filled with generic drugs.
  </font>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" color="#6600CC">Are brand-name drugs made in better factories? No</font></h3>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li><font face="Arial">Both brand name and generic drug factories must meet the same standards. 
  The FDA will not let drugs be made in poor quality factories. The FDA inspects 
  about 3,500 factories a year to make sure they meet the standards. Often the 
  same factories make both brand-name and generic drugs. </font> </li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" color="#6600CC">Why don't the drugs look the same?</font></h3>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li><font face="Arial">In the United States, laws do
not allow a generic drug to look
exactly like the brand name drug.
A generic drug must use the same
substances as brand name drugs.
Colors, flavors, and some other
inactive parts may be different.</font> </li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" color="#6600CC">Does every brand name drug have a generic form? No</font></h3>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li><font face="Arial">Brand name drugs are protected by patent for 20 years. When the patent 
  expires, other drug companies can create generics. But they must be tested by 
  the maker and approved by the FDA. </font> </li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" color="#6600CC">What is the best source of information about generic drugs?</font></h3>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li><font face="Arial">Contact your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for information on 
  generic drugs. </font></li>
