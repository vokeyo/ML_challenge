    <P> Some of the medicines of homeopathy evoke positive images--chamomile,
      marigold, daisy, onion. But even some of Mother Nature's cruelest
      creations--poison ivy, mercury, arsenic, pit viper venom, hemlock--are
      part of homeopathic care.</P>
    
    <P> Homeopathy is a medical theory and practice that developed in reaction
      to the bloodletting, blistering, purging, and other harsh procedures of
      conventional medicine as it was practiced more than 200 years ago.
      Remedies made from many sources--including plants, minerals or
      animals--are prescribed based on both a person's symptoms and personality.
      Patients receiving homeopathic care frequently feel worse before they get
      better because homeopathic medicines often stimulate, rather than
      suppress, symptoms. This seeming reversal of logic is a relevant part of
      homeopathy because symptoms are viewed as the body's effort to restore
      health.</P>
    
    <P> The Food and Drug Administration regulates homeopathic remedies under
      provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
    
    <P> <STRONG>Kinder, Gentler Medicine</STRONG> </P>
    
    <P> In the late 1700s, the most popular therapy for most ailments was
      bloodletting. Some doctors had so much faith in bleeding that they were
      willing to remove up to four-fifths of the patient's blood. Other
      therapies of choice included blistering--placing caustic or hot substances
      on the skin to draw out infections--and administering dangerous chemicals
      to induce vomiting or purge the bowels. Massive doses of a
      mercury-containing drug called calomel cleansed the bowels, but at the
      same time caused teeth to loosen, hair to fall out, and other symptoms of
      acute mercury poisoning.</P>
    
    <P> Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician disenchanted with these methods,
      began to develop a theory based on three principles: the law of similars,
      the minimum dose, and the single remedy.</P>
    
    <P> The word homeopathy is derived from the Greek words for like (homoios)
      and suffering (pathos). With the law of similars, Hahnemann theorized that
      if a large amount of a substance causes certain symptoms in a healthy
      person, smaller amounts of the same substance can treat those symptoms in
      someone who is ill. The basis of his theory took shape after a strong dose
      of the malaria treatment quinine caused his healthy body to develop
      symptoms similar to ones caused by the disease. He continued to test his
      theory on himself as well as family and friends with different herbs,
      minerals and other substances. He called these experiments &quot;provings.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> But, as might be expected, the intensity of the symptoms caused by the
      original proving was harrowing. So Hahnemann began decreasing the doses to
      see how little of a substance could still produce signs of healing.</P>
    
    <P> With the minimum dose, or law of infinitesimals, Hahnemann believed
      that a substance's strength and effectiveness increased the more it was
      diluted. Minuscule doses were prepared by repeatedly diluting the active
      ingredient by factors of 10. A &quot;6X&quot; preparation (the X is the
      Roman numeral for 10) is a 1-to-10 dilution repeated six times, leaving
      the active ingredient as one part per million. Essential to the process of
      increasing potency while decreasing the actual amount of the active
      ingredient is vigorous shaking after each dilution.</P>
    
    <P> Some homeopathic remedies are so dilute, no molecules of the healing
      substance remain. Even with sophisticated technology now available,
      analytical chemists may find it difficult or impossible to identify any
      active ingredient. But the homeopathic belief is that the substance has
      left its imprint or a spirit-like essence that stimulates the body to heal
      itself.</P>
    
    <P> Finally, a homeopathic physician generally prescribes only a single
      remedy to cover all symptoms--mental as well as physical--the patient is
      experiencing. However, the use of multi-ingredient remedies is recognized
      as part of homeopathic practice.</P>
    
    <P> <STRONG>FDA Regulation</STRONG> </P>
    
    <P> In 1938, Sen. Royal Copeland of New York, the chief sponsor of the
      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and a homeopathic physician, wrote into the
      law a recognition of any product listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of
      the United States. The Homeopathic Pharmacopeia includes a compilation of
      standards for source, composition and preparation of homeopathic drugs.</P>
    
    <P> FDA regulates homeopathic drugs in several significantly different ways
      from other drugs. Manufacturers of homeopathic drugs are deferred from
      submitting new drug applications to FDA. Their products are exempt from
      good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and
      from finished product testing for identity and strength. Homeopathic drugs
      in solid oral dosage form must have an imprint that identifies the
      manufacturer and indicates that the drug is homeopathic. The imprint on
      conventional products, unless specifically exempt, must identify the
      active ingredient and dosage strength as well as the manufacturer.</P>
    
    <P> &quot;The reasoning behind [the difference] is that homeopathic
      products contain little or no active ingredients,&quot; explains Edward
      Miracco, a consumer safety officer with FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation
      and Research. &quot;From a toxicity, poison-control standpoint, [the
      active ingredient and strength] was deemed to be unnecessary.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> Another difference involves alcohol. Conventional drugs for adults can
      contain no more than 10 percent alcohol, and the amount is even less for
      children's medications. But some homeopathic products contain much higher
      amounts because the agency has temporarily exempted these products from
      the alcohol limit rules.</P>
    
    <P> &quot;Alcohol is an integral part of many homeopathic products,&quot;
      says Miracco. For this reason, the agency has decided to delay its
      decision concerning alcohol in homeopathic products while it reviews the
      necessity of high levels of alcohol.</P>
    
    <P> &quot;Overall, the disparate treatment has been primarily based on the
      uniqueness of homeopathic products, the lack of any real concern over
      their safety because they have little or no pharmacologically active
      ingredients, and because of agency resources and priorities,&quot;
      explains Miracco.</P>
    
    <P> However, homeopathic products are not exempt from all FDA regulations.
      If a homeopathic drug claims to treat a serious disease such as cancer it
      can be sold by prescription only. Only products sold for so-called
      self-limiting conditions--colds, headaches, and other minor health
      problems that eventually go away on their own--can be sold without a
      prescription (over-the-counter).</P>
    
    <P> Requirements for nonprescription labeling include:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>an ingredients list </LI>
      <LI>instructions for safe use </LI>
      <LI>at least one major indication </LI>
      <LI>dilution (for example 2X for one part per hundred, 3X for one part
        per thousand).</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>Over the past several years, the agency has issued about 12 warning
      letters to homeopathic marketers. The most common infraction was the sale
      of prescription homeopathic drugs over-the-counter. &quot;It's illegal,
      it's in violation, and we're going to focus on it,&quot; says Miracco.</P>
    
    <P> Other problems include:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>products promoted as homeopathic that contain nonhomeopathic active
        ingredients, such as vitamins or plants not listed in homeopathic
        references </LI>
      <LI>lack of tamper-resistant packaging </LI>
      <LI>lack of proper labeling </LI>
      <LI>vague indications for use that could encompass serious disease
        conditions. For example, a phrase like &quot;treats gastrointestinal
        disorders&quot; is too general, explains Miracco. &quot;This phrase can
        encompass a wide variety of conditions, from stomachache or simple
        diarrhea to colon cancer,&quot; he says. &quot;Claims need to be
        specific so the consumer knows what the product is intended to treat and
        the indication does not encompass serious disease conditions that would
        require prescription dispensing and labeling.&quot;</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>In addition to enforcement, the agency is also focusing on preventing
      problems by educating the homeopathic industry about FDA regulations. &quot;Agency
      representatives continue to meet with homeopathic trade groups to tell
      them about problems we've had, difficulties we've seen, and trends we've
      noticed,&quot; says Miracco.</P>
    
    <P> FDA is aware of a few reports of illness associated with the use of
      homeopathic products. However, agency review of those reported to FDA
      discounted the homeopathic product involved as the cause of the adverse
      reaction. In one instance, arsenic, which is a recognized homeopathic
      ingredient, was implicated. But, as would be expected, FDA analysis
      revealed the concentration of arsenic was so minute there wasn't enough to
      cause concern, explains Miracco. &quot;It's been diluted out.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> <STRONG>Homeopathic Treatment</STRONG> </P>
    
    <P> Homeopathy consists of highly individualized treatments based on a
      person's genetic history, personal health history, body type, and present
      status of all physical, emotional and mental symptoms.</P>
    
    <P> Jennifer Jacobs, M.D., who has a family practice and is licensed to
      practice homeopathy in Washington state, spends at least an hour and a
      half with each new patient. &quot;What I do is review the lifetime history
      of the patient's health,&quot; she explains. &quot;Also I ask a lot of
      questions about certain general symptoms such as food preferences and
      sleep patterns that usually aren't seen as important in conventional
      medicine. In looking to make the match between the person and the remedy,
      I need to have all of this sort of information.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> Why does someone trained in conventional medicine turn to homeopathy? &quot;With
      chronic illnesses such as arthritis and allergies, conventional medicine
      has solutions that help control the symptoms but you don't really see the
      patients getting better,&quot; says Jacobs. &quot;What I have seen in my
      homeopathic work is that it really does seem to help people get better.
      I'm not saying I can cure everyone but I do see where people's overall
      health is improved over the course of treatment.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> Jacobs' hasn't abandoned conventional medicine completely. &quot;My
      daughter is 17 and she's never taken antibiotics, but I would have no
      hesitation to use antibiotics if she had pneumonia, or meningitis, or a
      kidney infection,&quot; says Jacobs.</P>
    
    <P> About a third of Jacobs' practice is children, and ear infections are
      one of the most common problems she treats. &quot;Ear infections are
      something that seems to respond well to homeopathy,&quot; she says. &quot;Of
      course, if a child is not better within two or three days, or if the child
      develops a high fever, or if I feel that there's a serious complication
      setting in, then of course I will use antibiotics. But I find that in the
      majority of cases, ear infections do resolve without antibiotics.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> In addition to treating patients, Jacobs has conducted a clinical trial
      the results of which suggest that homeopathic treatment might be useful in
      the treatment of acute childhood diarrhea. The results were published in
      the May 1994 issue of Pediatrics. In the article, Jacobs concluded that
      further studies should be conducted to determine whether her findings were
      accurate. A subsequent article appearing in the November 1995 issue of
      Pediatrics indicated that Jacobs' study was flawed in several ways.</P>
    
    <P> Although Pediatrics is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics,
      Jacobs' study and several others published in such journals as The Lancet
      and the British Medical Journal are considered &quot;scanty at best&quot;
      by the academy. &quot;Given the plethora of studies that are published [on
      other topics] in scientific journals, I wouldn't say there are a lot of
      articles coming out,&quot; says Joe M. Sanders Jr., M.D., the executive
      director of the academy. &quot;Just because an article appears in a
      scientific journal does not mean that it's absolute fact and should be
      immediately incorporated into therapeutic regimens. It just means that the
      study is [published] for critique and review and hopefully people will use
      that as a stepping stone for further research.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> More studies are under way. For example, the Office of Alternative
      Medicine at the National Institutes of Health has awarded a grant for a
      clinical trial of the effects of homeopathic treatment on mild traumatic
      brain injury.</P>
    
    <P> Even with the dearth of clinical research, homeopathy's popularity in
      the United States is growing. The 1995 retail sales of homeopathic
      medicines in the United States were estimated at $201 million and growing
      at a rate of 20 percent a year, according to the American Homeopathic
      Pharmaceutical Association. The number of homeopathic practitioners in the
      United States has increased from fewer than 200 in the 1970s to
      approximately 3,000 in 1996.</P>
    
    <P> When looking for a homeopathic practitioner, it's important to find
      someone who is licensed, according to the National Center for Homeopathy.
      Each state has its own licensing requirements. &quot;Whether that person
      is a medical doctor or a physician's assistant or a naturopathic
      physician, I feel that anyone who's treating people who are sick needs to
      have medical training,&quot; says Jacobs.</P>
    
    <P> <STRONG>Real Medicine or Wishful Thinking?</STRONG> </P>
    
    <P> Many who don't believe in homeopathy's effectiveness say any successful
      treatments are due to the placebo effect, or, in other words, positive
      thinking.</P>
    
    <P> But homeopathy's supporters counter that their medicine works in groups
      like infants and even animals that can't be influenced by a pep talk.
      Jacobs adds that sometimes she mistakenly gives a patient the wrong remedy
      and he or she doesn't get better. &quot;Then I give the right remedy, and
      the person does get better,&quot; she says. &quot;So it's not like
      everybody gets better because it's all in their head. I think it's only
      because we don't understand the mechanism of action of homeopathy that so
      many people have trouble accepting it.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> The American Medical Association does not accept homeopathy, but it
      doesn't reject it either. &quot;The AMA encourages doctors to become aware
      of alternative therapies and use them when and where appropriate,&quot;
      says AMA spokesman Jim Fox.</P>
    
    <P> Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics has no specific policy on
      homeopathy. If an adult asked the academy's Sanders about homeopathy, he
      would tell that person to &quot;do your own investigation. I don't
      personally prescribe homeopathic remedies, but I would be open-minded.&quot;</P>
    
    <P> That open-mindedness applies only to adults, however. &quot;I would
      have problems with somebody imposing other than conventional medicine onto
      a child who's incapable of making that decision,&quot; he says.</P>
    
    <P> Even professionals who practice homeopathy warn that nothing in
      medicine--either conventional or alternative--is absolute. &quot;I'm not
      saying we can cure everyone [with homeopathy],&quot; says Jacobs.</P>
