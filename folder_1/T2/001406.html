  Site</FONT></B></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">African American history in New York City began in the 
      Dutch colonies. The first Africans arrived in New Amsterdam as enslaved 
      men in 1625 and 1626; the first enslaved women in 1628. They worked as 
      farmers and builders and in the fur trade of the Dutch West India Company. 
      Some helped build the wall intended to keep settlers safe from the native 
      population at the location of today's Wall Street.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">In 1644, the Company granted "conditional freedom" to 
      the enslaved on condition that they make an annual fixed payment of farm 
      produce. The children of the "conditionally freed" people, born and 
      unborn, remained the property of the Company. Most of the families 
      received grants to lands they had been farming before becoming "free." At 
      the time the area was generally undesirable swamp land. Today most of the 
      area is in Greenwich Village.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The Dutch continued to expand and to import enslaved 
      Africans to meet growing labor needs. Between 1649 and 1659 they imported 
      hundreds of men, women and children. In New Amsterdam, the first sales 
      tax, an import tax of 10%, was imposed to discourage merchants from 
      selling "human cargo" outside of the colony. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Though not comprehensive, Dutch records do note that 
      there were Africans who had never been enslaved who were living on the 
      "free Negro lots" which today are located on land between from Astor Place 
      and Prince Street.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">In 1665, the Dutch surrendered New Amsterdam/New 
      Netherlands to the British. For most European settlers, little changed in 
      what became New York. For African New Yorkers, both enslaved and freed, 
      British occupation meant severe change. Under Dutch rule, some Africans 
      had gained half or full freedom. Even if enslaved, they had legal and 
      social rights. One example is that no master could whip an enslaved 
      African without the permission of the Dutch Common Council. This and other 
      rules changed under the British rule.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">In a move toward commercial efficiency, the British 
      formed the Royal African Company to import slaves directly from Africa to 
      New York. "From the start of the English occupation the creation of a 
      commercially profitable slave system became a joint project of both 
      government and private interests. Unlike the Dutch West India Company 
      which used slavery to implement colonial policy, the Royal African Company 
      used the colony to implement slavery." (Historian Edgar J. 
      McManus)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">New York's first slave market during the British 
      period was established at Wall Street and the East River in 1709. In the 
      early 1700's there were 800 African men, women, and children in the city; 
      about 15% of the total population. Local and state documents did not 
      distinguish between free and enslaved Africans until 1756. Before then the 
      term "slave" was used to describe all Africans and their decedents. They 
      were all looked upon as valuable sources of labor.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The British enacted numerous laws that restricted 
      where Africans could be employed and how they could be freed. Laws were 
      passed to prevent free Africans from aiding runaway slaves. The New York 
      "Slave Codes" grew so numerous that they are seen as a major cause of the 
      1712 slave revolt. In the revolt, enslaved Africans and natives gathered 
      in an orchard on Maiden Lane with hatchets, guns, knives, and hoes and set 
      out to burn and destroy property in the area. Nine whites were killed 
      during the revolt. Twenty-one enslaved Africans were executed and six were 
      reported to have committed suicide. After the revolt more laws were passed 
      that prohibited Africans and natives from carrying weapons and entering 
      military service. There were strict curfews and laws against gathering of 
      more than two or three enslaved people. The revolt emphasized the growing 
      fear that European New Yorkers had of the growing African population. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">At this time, Europeans in New York outnumbered people 
      of African descent five to one, but the city contained the largest 
      absolute number of enslaved Africans of any English colonial settlement 
      except Charleston, South Carolina, and held the largest proportion of 
      enslaved Africans of any northern settlement. By the first decade of the 
      1700's, forty percent of New York's households contained at least one 
      enslaved African; again, the largest proportion of any northern 
      settlement.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Africans were active in the American Revolution. Among 
      the first locals to show their defiance and the first casualty of the 
      Boston Massacre of 1770 was Chrispus Attucks, a black man. It has been 
      said that the American Revolution allowed the black man "... his 
      opportunity to fight in a war that would enable him to exercise his 
      abilities and strengths as a free man." The British also made use of 
      Africans to fill their ranks. One example being Benjamin Whitecuff, "a 
      Hempstead negro," who served as a spy and as a sailor in the Royal Navy. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The Battle of Long Island, which took place in 
      Brooklyn resulted in 10,000 British soldiers marching west through 
      Bedford, outflanking the Americans and inflicting heavy casualties. The 
      many lives lost included those of black members of the local militia. 
      Numerous other examples can be cited. Of special note is a black man, 
      James Armistead Lafayette, who was commended by the Marquis de Lafayette 
      for his distinguished war record in 1784. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">After the Revolution, equality came for some at 
      different rates for different people in different parts of the country. In 
      late 1807 the federal government passed a law prohibiting the importation 
      and/or sale of slaves within the United States and its territories. Many 
      social and economic factors contributed to the demise of slavery in the 
      north but it was not forgotten. Until 1850 it was still legal to move 
      existing slaves from and to anywhere within the national boundaries. 
      Throughout the first half of the century, ships dealing in the slave trade 
      could be seen being repaired and fitted out in New York harbors. It was 
      not until the 1860's that the ultimate test came as to whether "... this 
      nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long 
      endure."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The old suspicions related to the earliest slave 
      revolt clarify lessons that we are still learning. Perhaps one of the most 
      important is that Africans did not merely turn into black Europeans when 
      they arrived on this continent. African culture and traditions were kept 
      alive consciously for generations. Some of the particulars were lost along 
      the way but much that is African did not die in later times. African 
      Americans have a long and proud story to tell in the history of this 
      country and a unique cultural heritage. That heritage, in turn, shaped, 
      contributed to, and added color to a larger culture that is uniquely 
      American. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Although Africans were a vital part of society from 
      the earliest colonial times, there are few landmarks in New York City that 
      recognize their presence. They helped build the city but no statues or 
      other monuments were built in their honor. No streets, squares, buildings 
      or rivers have names with origins in their culture. Distinctly African 
      landmarks and physical remains are scarce and scattered where they exist 
      at all. The Burial Ground is significant because, in the midst of lower 
      Manhattan, there exists the remains of an African culture stretching back 
      to over 350 years. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><b><FONT face=Arial color=#663300 size="2">(2) The Site:</FONT></b></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The site description filed with the New York City 
      Landmarks Preservation Commission states:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">"Throughout the eighteenth century, New York's free 
      and enslaved Africans buried their dead in a parcel of land which now is 
      part of the city's civic center area. ..... The total area is 
      approximately seven acres..... The site is currently characterized by a 
      nineteenth- and twentieth-century built environment including buildings, a 
      construction site, parking areas, and city streets, under which a large 
      portion of the African Burial Ground is preserved. The site's preservation 
      in this area was due to sixteen to twenty-five feet of fill which has 
      protected the original ground surface and an intact stratum of burials. 
      The basements of buildings subsequently erected on the site penetrated 
      only the fill, except on the lots on Broadway where the original ground 
      surface was higher."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The area of the African Burial Ground was known and 
      used as part of New York's "common" land until the late eighteenth 
      century. Africans used land for a burial place that was then remote from 
      the colonial town by virtue of its location in a low-lying area between 
      hills, as well as in actual distance. The date of its initial use is not 
      known. The earliest document that mentions the ground is from 1712/13. In 
      it, a military chaplain wrote that "Negroes" were being buried in the 
      Common by "those of their country." The "common" land stretched to the 
      north of the eighteenth-century town, beginning at the southern end of the 
      present City Hall Park. It is known that the twenty one Africans executed 
      after the 1712 slave revolt were buried in that area.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The exact location is not known, but a clue is offered 
      in a 1722 law prohibiting night funerals of slaves "south of the Collect 
      Pond." By 1732 a piece of ground north of the city and just south of the 
      Collect Pond had been labeled as the "Negro Burying Place" on a map of the 
      city. In 1741, thirteen African men were burned at the stake and seventeen 
      hanged because of conspiracy against the crown. The judge's records 
      indicate that the executions took place between two collect ponds, 
      evidence indicates subsequent burials in the nearby African Burial 
      Ground.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">The African Burial Ground is clearly labeled on an 
      official 1755 plan of New York. It is shown north of the palisade, thus 
      just outside the growing town. The British Headquarters Map of New York 
      dating to about 1782 shows a burial ground immediately north of the 
      Revolutionary War barracks.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">A 1785 survey of the area was made for the purpose of 
      dividing property into blocks and lots for sale and subsequent 
      development. The land involved was shown as being bounded on the south by 
      the "Negros Burial Ground." The burial area itself occupied land that was 
      part of a patent belonging to a local European family which dated back to 
      1673. In 1795, family heirs exchanged this land for city lots further to 
      the east. This marked the end of the area as a burial place. The land was 
      soon subdivided and houses were constructed on lots immediately after each 
      survey was completed. In 1796, the Common Council arranged to acquire part 
      of the "Negros Burial Ground" for laying out Chambers Street east of 
      Broadway.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">By 1812, the area including the "African burying 
      ground", was reported to have developed from "uninviting suburbs" to a 
      place "covered with a flourishing population, and elegant improvements." 
      Fortunately for the preservation of the burial ground most "improvements" 
      were made at ground level, on the rubble of earlier structures or on fill 
      that was purposely brought in for construction. Some areas saw very little 
      disturbance. It was not until the modern towers of New York began to be 
      built that deep foundation footings were required for 
stability.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2"><B>1987 </B>- The General Services Administration 
      (GSA) began planning to provide greater office space for Federal agencies 
      and to provide additional courtrooms and support space for the adjacent 
      U.S. courthouse located in the Civic Center-Foley Square area of lower 
      Manhattan. The site proposed was between Broadway, Duane, Elk and Reade 
      streets.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2"><B>1989</B> - Before construction could begin, 
      compliance with a number of laws was required. Most important was Section 
      106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. It states that, 
      before receiving funding for construction, federal agencies must determine 
      if the proposed site merits inclusion on the National Register of Historic 
      Places. GSA was also required to consult with the Advisory Council on 
      Historic Preservation and a Memorandum of Agreement was signed between the 
      two parties in 1989.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2"><B>1991 </B>- The Memorandum of Agreement was amended 
      and signed by GSA, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the 
      New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2"><B>June 1991</B> - Human remains were discovered 
      during archaeological testing and by October full-scale excavation for the 
      construction of the Foley Square Project federal building had begun. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2"><B>1992</B> - the Mayor of New York formed the Mayor&#8217;s 
      Task Force on the African Burial Ground. Members of this Task Force later 
      formed the basis of the Federal Steering Committee. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2"><B>July 1992</B> - at least 390 burials had been 
      removed. In response to a letter from Mayor Dinkins, GSA stated that they 
      intended to excavate an additional 200 burials on a portion of the site 
      that was to become a four story pavilion beside the office building. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Also in July 1992, Congressman Augustus Savage, 
      Chairman of the House of Representatives&#8217; Subcommittee on Buildings and 
      Grounds informed GSA that no further projects would be funded until he had 
      personally met with the GSA Administrator to review issues concerning this 
      project. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Later in July 1992 and immediately thereafter, 
      meetings were held with GSA, members of congress and city agencies. It was 
      agreed that "&#8230; a Federal advisory committee of primarily descendant 
      African community leaders and professionals be established to make 
      recommendations to GSA with regard to its Section 106 responsibilities at 
      the site." </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2"><B>October 1992</B>- The Federal Steering Committee 
      was chartered to represent the interests of the community and to make 
      recommendations regarding the Burial Ground. Its mandates included: (1) 
      the review of proposals regarding the human remains on the Pavilion site, 
      (2) the analysis, curation and reinternment of remains removed from the 
      African Burial Ground and (3) the construction of a memorial or other 
      improvements on the Pavilion site.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size="2">Shortly afterwards, President Bush signed a law 
      ordering GSA to abandon construction on the Pavilion site, and approving 
      the appropriation of up to $3 million for modification of the Pavilion 
      site and "appropriate" memorialization of the African Burial Ground.
