    supervision of the Attorney General, who shall provide general

    filed under title 11, United States Code, may obtain judicial
    review of the final agency decision by commencing an action in the
    district court of the United States for the district for which the
    panel to which the trustee is appointed under subsection (a)(1), or
    in the district court of the United States for the district in
    which the trustee is appointed under subsection (b) resides, after
    first exhausting all available administrative remedies, which if
    the trustee so elects, shall also include an administrative hearing
    on the record. Unless the trustee elects to have an administrative
    hearing on the record, the trustee shall be deemed to have
    exhausted all administrative remedies for purposes of this
    paragraph if the agency fails to make a final agency decision
    within 90 days after the trustee requests administrative remedies.
    The Attorney General shall prescribe procedures to implement this
    paragraph. The decision of the agency shall be affirmed by the
    district court unless it is unreasonable and without cause based on
    the administrative record before the agency.
      (e)(1) The Attorney General, after consultation with a United
    States trustee that has appointed an individual under subsection
    (b) of this section to serve as standing trustee in cases under
    chapter 12 or 13 of title 11, shall fix - 
        (A) a maximum annual compensation for such individual
      consisting of - 
          (i) an amount not to exceed the highest annual rate of basic
        pay in effect for level V of the Executive Schedule; and
          (ii) the cash value of employment benefits comparable to the
        employment benefits provided by the United States to
        individuals who are employed by the United States at the same
        rate of basic pay to perform similar services during the same
        period of time; and

        (B) a percentage fee not to exceed - 
          (i) in the case of a debtor who is not a family farmer, ten
        percent; or
          (ii) in the case of a debtor who is a family farmer, the sum
        of - 
            (I) not to exceed ten percent of the payments made under
          the plan of such debtor, with respect to payments in an
          aggregate amount not to exceed $450,000; and
            (II) three percent of payments made under the plan of such
          debtor, with respect to payments made after the aggregate
          amount of payments made under the plan exceeds $450,000;

      based on such maximum annual compensation and the actual,
      necessary expenses incurred by such individual as standing
      trustee.

      (2) Such individual shall collect such percentage fee from all
    payments received by such individual under plans in the cases under
    chapter 12 or 13 of title 11 for which such individual serves as
    standing trustee. Such individual shall pay to the United States
    trustee, and the United States trustee shall deposit in the United
    States Trustee System Fund - 
        (A) any amount by which the actual compensation of such
      individual exceeds 5 per centum upon all payments received under
      plans in cases under chapter 12 or 13 of title 11 for which such
      individual serves as standing trustee; and
        (B) any amount by which the percentage for all such cases
      exceeds - 
          (i) such individual's actual compensation for such cases, as
        adjusted under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1); plus
          (ii) the actual, necessary expenses incurred by such
        individual as standing trustee in such cases. Subject to the
        approval of the Attorney General, any or all of the interest
        earned from the deposit of payments under plans by such
        individual may be utilized to pay actual, necessary expenses
        without regard to the percentage limitation contained in
        subparagraph (d)(1)(B) of this section.

      (3) After first exhausting all available administrative remedies,
    an individual appointed under subsection (b) may obtain judicial
    review of final agency action to deny a claim of actual, necessary
    expenses under this subsection by commencing an action in the
    district court of the United States for the district where the
    individual resides. The decision of the agency shall be affirmed by
    the district court unless it is unreasonable and without cause
    based upon the administrative record before the agency.
      (4) The Attorney General shall prescribe procedures to implement
    this subsection.
      (f)(1) The United States trustee for each district is authorized
    to contract with auditors to perform audits in cases designated by
    the United States trustee, in accordance with the procedures
    established under section 603(a) of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention
    and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.
      (2)(A) The report of each audit referred to in paragraph (1)
    shall be filed with the court and transmitted to the United States
    trustee. Each report shall clearly and conspicuously specify any
    material misstatement of income or expenditures or of assets
    identified by the person performing the audit. In any case in which
    a material misstatement of income or expenditures or of assets has
    been reported, the clerk of the district court (or the clerk of the
    bankruptcy court if one is certified under section 156(b) of this
    title) shall give notice of the misstatement to the creditors in
    the case.
      (B) If a material misstatement of income or expenditures or of
    assets is reported, the United States trustee shall - 
        (i) report the material misstatement, if appropriate, to the
      United States Attorney pursuant to section 3057 of title 18; and
        (ii) if advisable, take appropriate action, including but not
      limited to commencing an adversary proceeding to revoke the
      debtor's discharge pursuant to section 727(d) of title 11.

    under the plan.
      (e) Periodic Reports. - The uniform forms for periodic reports
    required under subsection (a) for use by trustees or debtors in
    possession under chapter 11 of title 11 shall, in addition to such

      debtor for the most recent period and cumulatively since the date
      of the order for relief;
        (5) compliance with title 11, whether or not tax returns and
      tax payments since the date of the order for relief have been
      timely filed and made;

      the most recent period and cumulatively since the date of the
      order for relief (separately reported, for the professional fees
      incurred by or on behalf of the debtor, between those that would
      have been incurred absent a bankruptcy case and those not); and
        (7) plans of reorganization filed and confirmed and, with
      respect thereto, by class, the recoveries of the holders,
      expressed in aggregate dollar values and, in the case of claims,
