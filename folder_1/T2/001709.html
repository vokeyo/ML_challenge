SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a license 
amendment to Pharmacopeia, Inc. for Materials License No. 29-30152-01, 
to authorize release of its facility in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey 
for unrestricted use. NRC has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) 
in support of this action in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 
part 51. Based on the EA, the NRC has concluded that a Finding of No 
Significant Impact (FONSI) is appropriate. The amendment will be issued 
following the publication of this Notice.

II. EA Summary

    The purpose of the action is to authorize the release of the 
licensee's Monmouth Junction, New Jersey facility for unrestricted use. 
Pharmacopeia, Inc. was authorized by NRC from February 1999 to use 
radioactive materials for research and development purposes at the 
site. On April 28, 2004, Pharmacopeia, Inc. requested that NRC release 
the facility for unrestricted use. Pharmacopeia, Inc. has conducted 
surveys of the facility and provided information to the NRC to 
demonstrate that the site meets the license termination criteria in 
Subpart E of 10 CFR part 20 for unrestricted use. Pharmacopeia, Inc. 
will continue licensed activities at another location, as authorized by 
the license.
    The NRC staff has prepared an EA in support of the license 
amendment. The facility was remediated and surveyed prior to the 
licensee requesting the license amendment. The NRC staff has reviewed 
the information and final status survey submitted by Pharmacopeia, Inc. 
Based on its review, the staff has determined that there are no 
additional remediation activities necessary to complete the proposed 
action. Therefore, the staff considered the impact of the residual 
radioactivity at the facility and concluded that since the residual 
radioactivity meets the requirements in Subpart E of 10 CFR Part 20, a 
Finding of No Significant Impact is appropriate.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The staff has prepared the EA (summarized above) in support of the 
license amendment to release the facility for unrestricted use. The NRC 
staff has evaluated Pharmacopeia, Inc.''s request and the results of 
the surveys and has concluded that the completed action complies with 
the criteria in Subpart E of 10 CFR Part 20. The staff has found that 
the environmental impacts from the action are bounded by the impacts 
evaluated by NUREG-1496, Volumes 1-3, ``Generic Environmental Impact 
Statement in Support of Rulemaking on Radiological Criteria for License 
Termination of NRC-Licensed Facilities' (ML042310492, ML042320379, and 
ML042330385). On the basis of the EA, the NRC has concluded that the 
environmental impacts from the action are expected to be insignificant 
and has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for 
the action.
