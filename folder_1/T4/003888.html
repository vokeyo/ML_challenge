<H1 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="BLUE">&quot;Existing Features&quot; Typical Section</font></H1>



<P>In order to use any of the &quot;Typical Sections&quot;, you must first <a href="proj_man.htm">Setup 
  Project Manager</a>:</P>



<p>This typical section will search for MicroStation elements previously drawn 
  in a 2D Plan file that represent the horizontal alignment of existing features. 
  This 2D plan file is usually obtained from the Survey branch and usually has 
  a file extension of .plm or has &quot;plm&quot; within the file name, i.e.... <strong>wf1581plm1.dgn</strong>.</p>
<p>Once finished searching the 2D plan file, the corresponding text for each existing 
  feature will be drawn in the cross section file at the exact same offsets as 
  found in the 2D plan file. In some cases, lines will also be drawn representing 
  existing thicknesses, (such as topsoil or pavement). These lines can be used 
  later to calculate end areas and volumes representing &quot;in place&quot; removals.</p>
<p>The complete list of &quot;<b>Existing Features</b>&quot; currently available 
  are shown below:</p>
 <ul> 
<li><b>Existing Water Edge</b>
<li><b>Existing Lake Edge</b>
<li><b>Existing Gas Line</b>
<li><b>Existing Telephone Line</b>
<li><b>Existing Electric Line</b>
<li><b>Existing Wetlands</b>
<li><b>Existing Treeline</b>
<li><b>Existing Pavement (Removal)</b>
<li><b>Existing Shoulders </b>
<li><b>Existing Archaeological</b>
<li><b>Existing Thermal Wetlands</b>
<li><b>Existing Fence Line</b>
<li><b>Existing Topsoil</b><br>
</ul>

<p><font size="5"><b>Setup the Proposed Cross Section Run:</b></font></p>
<p>Open your Cross Section DGN file that contains your existing ground elements. 
  Invoke Project Manager, as explained under <a href="proj_man.htm">Setup Project 
  Manager</a>. Put a <b>check mark</b> in the white box for <b>Working Alignment 
  Influence Runs</b> as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea1.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on the <b>Proposed Cross Sections</b> button as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea2.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>Select Run</b> dialog appears. Create a &quot;Run&quot; by using the 
  pulldowns <b>Run</b> &gt; <b>New</b>.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">NOTE: The &quot;Run&quot; will serve the same purpose 
  as the old Proposed Cross Section Input File. Multiple &quot;Runs&quot; can 
  be created the same as multiple proposed cross section input file could be created 
  in the past.</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea3.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>New Run Name</b> dialog appears. Key in the name of the run. An optional 
  <b>Description</b> can also be filled in. Click on <b>OK</b> as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea4.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>Select Run</b> dialog appears. <b>Highlight</b> the Run and click on 
  <b>OK</b> as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea5.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>Proposed Cross Sections</b> dialog appears. Notice that the name of 
  the Run (in this case <b>Run_1</b>) also appears at the top of the dialog as 
  shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea6.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>XS DGN File</b> and browse to the cross section DGN file. Adjust 
  the <b>Tolerance</b> setting as described below:</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE: The &quot;Tolerance&quot; setting is very important. 
  For Metric projects, set this to 0.003. For US Customary projects, set the tolerance 
  to 0.01.</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea7.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Pattern</b> and put a <b>check</b> in the white box for <b>Use 
  Working Alignment</b>. Since your pattern lines have been previously defined 
  in your working alignment &quot;<b>one</b>&quot;, there is no need to identify 
  them again.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea8.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Existing Ground</b> and put a <b>check</b> in the white box for 
  <b>Use Working Alignment</b>. Since your Existing Ground has been previously 
  defined in your working alignment &quot;<b>one</b>&quot;, there is no need to 
  identify it again.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea9.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Shapes</b>. This Typical Section does not require superelevation 
  shapes, set the option toggle to <b>Shapeless</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="style1">NOTE: If this is accidentally set to something other than Shapeless, the criteria will still draw the &quot;&lt;---Existing Edge of Pavement&quot; label, but will not draw the layers illustrating pavement or topsoil removal.</span></p>
  <p><img src="ex_fea10.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Shape Clusters</b>. Initially the dialog appears as shown below, 
  basically blank with many of the option buttons ghosted out:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea11.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on the <b>drop down arrow </b>  and select the <b>Chain</b> as shown below.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><img src="ex_fea12.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on the <b>drop down arrow </b> and select the <b>Profile</b> as shown below.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea13.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on the <b>Add</b> button as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea14.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the <b>Add</b> button is pressed the shape cluster information gets added 
  to the collection window. <b>Highlight</b> the information in the collection 
  window. The <b>Typical</b> button becomes unghosted. Click on the <b>Typical</b> 
  button as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea15.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>Typical Sections</b> dialog appears as shown below. Select the desired 
  Typical Section. Note the <b>Description</b> button located on the right side 
  of the dialog. When pressed, this invokes an on-line help file that provides 
  detailed information on how the typical works including detailed drawings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style1">NOTE: For an explanation of both methods for accessing Help for Typical sections, click <a href="prxs_help.htm">here</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this example we are using <b>Existing Features</b>, so select <b>EXFEAT</b>.</p>
<p>You may apply this Typical Section to the <b>Whole Chain</b> or a <b>Station 
  Range</b>. When <b>Apply to Station Range</b> is selected, be sure to include 
  the region numbers, as shown below (<b>r 1</b>).</p>
<p>Do <b>not</b> check the white &quot;<b>On</b>&quot; Chain box. Chances are 
  you will never use this option.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea16.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When all options are selected and complete, click on <b>Apply</b> at the bottom 
  of the dialog.</p>
<p>Each Typical Section is associated with different combinations of criteria 
  files. When <b>Apply</b> is pressed, the user is basically instructing the software 
  what criteria files to use (and where) and populates the Proposed Cross Sections 
  dialog as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea17.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Define DGN Variables</b>. You can ignore this portion of the <b>Proposed 
  Cross Sections</b> dialog as it <b>only applies to the Automated Cross Section 
  Labeling Typical</b>.</p>
<p>When using the <b>.x21 criteria files</b>, this dialog is now blank<b>, since 
  there is nothing to populate these fields, with this Typical.</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea18.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Define Variables</b>. This portion of the dialog is where you specify 
  &quot;Global&quot; variables such as the name of your mapping file where all 
  the existing features are drawn (existing fence, existing edge of pavement.......). 
  You must also specify the names of all other DGN files where the software is 
  supposed to look for plan view elements, such as proposed widening lines, or 
  proposed guardrail.</p>
<p><font size="4">To change/modify a default value:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Highlight</b> the Variable, (such as <b>Existing TOPO DGN</b>), by clicking 
    in the white area.</li>
  <li>Once highlighted, the default value will populate the <b>Value</b> field.</li>
  <li>Key-in the Value (or use the newly added &quot;<strong>Select a DGN file</strong>&quot; icon) and press <b>Modify</b>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><img src="ex_fea19.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Redefinable Variables</b>. This portion of the dialog is where 
  the user can set <b>project specific values</b> for their design.</p>
<p> In the example below, the <b>Existing Pavement Thickness</b> variable (_d_ExistPavtThick) 
  needed to be modified. The Variable was <b>highlighted</b> and the <b>Edit</b> 
  button was pressed. When <b>Edit</b> was pressed the <b>Redefinable Variables 
  Editor</b> dialog was invoked. The default value was changed to <b>0.3</b>. 
  The <b>Save</b> button would now be pressed to save the value. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="ex_fea20.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Plot Parameters</b>. Uncheck all Plot options as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea21.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Drainage</b> is not used in Western Federal Lands.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size="5"><b>Execute the Proposed Cross Section Run:</b></font></p>
<p>When all modifications are completed, save the Run settings using the pulldown 
  <b>File</b> &gt; <b>Save Settings</b> as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea22.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To execute the Proposed Cross Section Run, use the pulldown <b>File</b> &gt; 
  <b>Run</b> as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea23.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dialog below will appear.</p>
<p> Set the dialog to <b>To Screen</b> or to create a .log file by selecting <b>To 
  Log File</b>. Check <b>Pause On Each Section</b> or the newly added option that speeds up the processing by not actually showing you each of the cross sections as they process, <strong><span class="style2">Disable View Updat</span>e</strong>, and press <b>Apply</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea24.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <b>Pause On Each Section</b> was checked, and after the first cross section is plotted and inspected, you may <b>uncheck</b> the <b>Pause 
  on Each Section</b> toggle and press <b>Apply</b> again to complete the run.</p>
