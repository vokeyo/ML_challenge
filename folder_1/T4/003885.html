      <h2>ARCHAEOLOGY</h2>
      <p>Between 1450 and 1600 ancient Rome began to emerge from beneath the shapeless 
        pastures and deserted hills of the ancient city. Renaissance scholars 
        identified major sites and buildings. They began the great effort of copying 
        the ancient inscriptions that made the city itself a vast, if fragmentary, 
        textbook about Roman history and life. </p>

      <h3><a name="lrrr">Learning to Read Rome's Ruins</a></h3>
      <p>By the middle of the fifteenth century, scholars in the curia--like the 
        brilliant architect Leon Battista Alberti and the erudite scholar Flavio 
        Biondo--knew the ancient city better than anyone had for a thousand years. 
        Artists recorded the ruins that survived, broken and ivy-covered, and 
        reconstructed the original palaces and temples in all their crisp-edged 
        glory. Architects tried to grasp the rules and methods of the Roman builders. 
        When ancient works of art, like the Laocoon, came to light they immediately 
        became famous and influential, finding prominent places in the sculpture 
        collections that adorned the Capitoline hill, the Belvedere court of the 
        Vatican, and many private houses. Drawn and printed images of them circulated 
        throughout Europe and scholars and artists made pilgrimages to Rome to 
        see them. By the middle of the sixteenth century, Roman scholars had recreated 
        the whole web and texture of ancient Roman life, from its physical environment 
        to its religious rituals, in astonishingly vivid detail. True, not even 
        papal support could stop the destruction of individual monuments and buildings; 
        much continued to be lost or scattered. The study of the ruins prospered 
        even as buildings were torn down or burnt to make lime. In the course 
        of the sixteenth century, Roman archaeologists shed new light on the Egyptian 
        and early Christian worlds as well as on Rome itself. </p>

      <h3><a name="srtc">The Origins of Archaeology: Scholars Read the City</a></h3>
      <p>By the fourteenth century, Italian intellectuals were becoming fascinated 
        by the physical as well as the literary relics of the ancient world. Rome, 
        of course, had the grandest of all ruins, at which medieval pilgrims had 
        long marvelled. The Roman in the street was happy to provide misinformation 
        about sites and statues, but in the Renaissance, scholars began to measure, 
        excavate, and identify the statues and buildings that had long amazed 
        travellers. True, much was lost forever. When Poggio Bracciolini and a 
        friend climbed the Capitoline Hill in 1430, the vast view that opened 
        out before them was a desert; the ancient forum was populated only by 
        pigs, deer, and vegetables. But by the end of the fifteenth century, Roman 
        scholars had identified the sites of many lost buildings, compiled notebooks 
        bulging with information, and begun to recreate the ancient city. </p>

      <p>Giovanni de Matociis (d. 1337), known as Giovanni Mansionario because 
        of his official office in the cathedral at Verona, used the very rich 
        library preserved there to splendid effect. A prescient scholar, he proved 
        that there had been not one but two Plinys, the elder who wrote the <em>Natural 
        History</em> and the younger who described the elder's death in the eruption 
        of Vesuvius. Both his erudition and his critical skills served him well 
        in the writing of his immense <em>Historia imperialis,</em> a biographical 
        compilation that began with Augustus. He shows a real interest in trying 
        to recreate ancient Roman life in three dimensions, as 3~is clear from 
        his stiff but fascinating marginal drawings of emperors' heads (derived 
        from Roman coins) and a Roman circus (which he based not on the remains 
        of the Arena in Verona but on textual information from a late antique 
        encyclopedia). </p>

      <p>Many Roman families took a deep interest in the exploration of ancient 
        ruins. Cristoforo Buondelmonti dedicated this treatise on his adventurous 
        exploration of the islands of the Aegean to Cardinal Giordano Orsini in 
        1420. All extant manuscripts are copies of the original, nonetheless the 
        illustrations suggest the nostalgic and obsessive love for the classical 
        last that made Buondelmonte risk capture by pirates and death from starvation. 
        Here, carefully drawn ruins evoke the pathos of what he took to be the 
        ruins of Troy. </p>

      <p>In the papal curia in the 1420s and after, some papal secretaries became 
        expert archaeologists. This splendid miniature of Poggio represents one 
        of the most adventurous of all the fifteenth- century explorers of the 
        classical past. Poggio Bracciolini walked the streets and inspected the 
        stones of Rome, intent on preserving and recording every detail and "stupefied" 
        by the continuing destruction of important ancient buildings. In this 
        book he makes the theme of fortune's power to destroy the pretext for 
        a detailed firsthand survey of Rome's ruins. It begins dramatically, with 
        Poggio and a friend surveying the scene visible from the top of the Capitoline, 
        and includes detailed study of such technical matters as the composition 
        of the city's walls. </p>

      <p>Pomponio Leto, a famous teacher as well as a brilliant antiquary, lectured 
        in Rome on many classical texts, including the work of the Roman scholar 
        Varro on the Latin language. This text gave him the pretext for discussion 
        of many Roman customs, places, and buildings, which he evidently described 
        in detail and even showed to his students. The student who copied this 
        manuscript had a lively talent for drawing, seen here in his sketches 
        of the Baths of Diocletian. As a whole the lectures show the rich way 
        in which Roman texts and antiquities illuminated each other in the interdisciplinary 
        scholarship of the Roman humanists. </p>

      <p>In his view of Chios and Mytilene, Buondelmonti shows the site where 
        he saw "the tomb of the bard Homer" (Chios) and where, as he knew, Sappho, 
        Theophrastus, and other distinguished ancients had lived (Mytilene). </p>

      <h3><a name="tcra">From Collection to Reconstruction: The City Rises Again</a></h3>
      <p>Archaeology was a field where scholars and artists collaborated. The 
        brilliant Leon Battista Alberti, Nicholas V's architectural adviser, roamed 
        the entire city in order to learn how the Romans had built. His own book 
        on architecture, the first modern one, offered modern readers a vast amount 
        of archaeological information. In the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
        more and more classical works of art came to light, and artists joined 
        the pious in making pilgrimages to Rome. From tiny manuscript illuminations 
        to huge systematic sketchbooks, the artists' record of the ancient city 
        eloquently reveals the reverence and fascination that antiquity inspired.

      <p>These fragments of what seems to have been Leto's field notebook contain 
        his notes on an inscription including an ancient Roman calendar on stone. 
        This calendar depicted the signs of the zodiac through which the sun passed, 
        gave the lengths of days and nights, listed the agricultural tasks and 
        religious festivals appropriate to each month, and provided other important 
        information, like the dates of the solstices and equinoxes. The Roman 
        calendar was complex, sophisticated, and steeped in beliefs deeply rooted 
        in the Roman past. Leto's discovery, now known as the <em>Menologium rusticum 
        Vallense,</em> was a major addition to the humanists' stock of knowledge 
        about Roman practices and beliefs. </p>

      <p>The <em>Menologium</em> that Pomponio Leto copied out was printed in 
        a little brochure in Rome early in the sixteenth century. The printer, 
        Mazzocchi, drew his text from a manuscript collection of inscriptions 
        compiled by one of the most expert specialist antiquaries of the late 
        fifteenth century, Fra Giovanni Giocondo. Though texts like this circulated 
        widely in the age of manuscripts, printing obviously made them accessible 
        to a far larger circle of scholars than scribal efforts could. </p>

        <em>Paper <br>

      <p>Leon Battista Alberti helped Pope Nicholas V draw up the first of many 
        projects to rebuild Rome and studied the work of ancient architects building 
        by building. In this short treatise he describes how to use a mathematical 
        instrument to measure the distances between the most important Roman buildings 
        and to plot them on a circular map. Alberti had seen and been impressed 
        by the maps in the Greek text of Ptolemy's <em>Geography</em> and hoped 
        to provide an equally rigorous and quantitative framework for the study 
        of ancient and modern Rome--an enterprise characteristic of the curia.

      <p>Flavio Biondo, papal secretary and historian, reconstructed the physical 
        and institutional textures of Roman life in works that remained standard 
        for a century or more. He reached a large audience through printed editions 
        of the originals and Italian translations. His great compilation <em>Roma 
        instaurata,</em> displayed here, provided the first systematic and well-documented 
        guide to the ruins of the city. The pages shown describe the Baths of 
        Diocletian. </p>

      <h3><a name="ccaeo">Other Romes: Christian Catacombs and Egyptian Obelisks</a></h3>
      <p>Renaissance archaeologists loved Roman culture, but they were also fascinated 
        by Rome's great, mysterious relics of ancient Egypt: the obelisks, some 
        of them inscribed with mysterious hieroglyphs, that Roman emperors had 
        brought across the Mediterranean. One of these relics, at once threatening 
        and magnificent, was still standing by the Vatican; others were discovered 
        underground. Scholars tried to understand their messages and functions. 
        The imperious pope Sixtus V had five of them raised--a job so hard that 
        Michelangelo had refused to undertake it. Once formally exorcised of their 
        evil spirits, the obelisks clearly showed that Christianity had overtaken 
        Rome and Egypt alike in power and glory. Still other archaeologists penetrated 
        the buried early Christian tombs in the catacombs under the city, making 
        adventurous trips into the dark to find a whole lost world of early Christian 
        symbolism and imagery. </p>

      <p class="caption">Alfonso Chacon, Christian Inscriptions [image not available 
        at this time] <br>
        <em>Sixteenth century</em> </p>
      <p>This notebook was made by no fewer than five artists working under the 
        direction of an expert on early Christianity, Alfonso Chacon, in the late 
        sixteenth century. Inspired by the need to defend Catholicism against 
        Protestant attacks, Roman scholars studied the early Christian art of 
        the catacombs. They identified some basic themes and conventions of early 
        Christian art, such as the frequent representation of Christ as a shepherd. 
        The artists' skill was not great, however, and some images--like the revival 
        of Lazarus 
        <!-- pictured here-->
        are almost unrecognizable. </p>

      <p>This work is a classic of Counter-Reformation scholarship--an effort 
        to show that the true church had always been Catholic. The manuscript 
        shows that Carlo Baronio inserted his reference to the forged works of 
        the Egyptian prophet Hermes Trismegistus--a glaring error for which he 
        was chastised by the Protestant Isaac Casaubon--into the text of his church 
        history only after he had composed it in draft. The manuscript, with its 
        many corrections and additions, gives a good sense of the scale of Baronio's 
        enterprise as well as of the occasional weaknesses of his research and 
        criticism of sources. </p>

      <p>This romantic, pseudo-Egyptian image was widely reused in the sixteenth

        style that seemed authentically classical to many readers, incorporated 
        genuine Roman ruins and reliefs. The book did much to spread a taste for 
        Egyptian relics and to heighten scholars' and artists' interest in the

        <em>Fifteenth century</em> </p>
      <p>This document is one of the monuments of historical criticism. Lorenzo 
        Valla here attacks the Donation of Constantine, an eighth-century forgery 
        which supported the papacy's claim to supreme political authority in Europe. 
        Valla shows that the text could not have been written in the fourth century, 
        the age of Constantine the Great, by revealing many anachronisms in form 
        and content. </p>

      <p>The texts of a late antique Christian theologian were ascribed during 
        the Middle Ages to Saint Paul's sole Athenian convert, Dionysius. Ambrogio 
        Traversari, the great expert on Christian Greek among the early humanists, 
        produced this new Latin translation of the Greek original. Pope Nicholas 
        V was delighted by it. In his colophon, Traversari thanks God for helping 
        him complete his translation. </p>

      <p>The many views of Rome published by Etienne Dup&eacute;rac late in the 
        sixteenth century, like this splendid, nostalgic view of the Circus Maximus 
        and the Palatine, both provided newly accurate visual information and 
        conveyed a rich sense of the decayed state in which Rome's antiquities 
        lay. Collectors assembled albums of these printed views, which often varied 
        from one another in content. These albums circulated widely and provided 
        the reading public of the age of print with something of the satisfaction 
        afforded previously by artists' notebooks. </p>

      <p>Architects and artists recorded and reconstructed the ruins of Rome, 
        and their sketchbooks were vastly important for the spread of visual information 
        (and remain so as a record of sites and buildings that have since been 
        altered or destroyed). Here Giuliano da Sangallo portrays, among other 
        sites, the Palatine hill, the Colosseum, and the Porta Labicana. This 
        manuscript sketchbook, derived in part from the work of earlier artists, 
        shows how rigorously the artists scrutinized Rome's ruins. </p>

      <p>Plans like this one by Pietro del Massaio, along with the maps that naturally 
        accompanied the <em>Geography,</em> helped to make the book one of the 
        best-sellers of fifteenth-century Europe. In this plan by Pietro del Massaio, 
        the Castel Sant'Angelo, the Borgo, and Saint Peter's appear at bottom 
        right, separated from the city by the Tiber. Within the city proper, the 
        ancient monuments rise, stripped of modern buildings and urban sprawl. 
        The Pantheon, the Forum, the Capitoline and Palatine hills, and the Colosseum 
        dominate the central space, though a few churches appear beside them. 
        Other monuments, like the Pyramide (top right), can readily be identified.

      <p>The formidably learned Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher, directed the excavation 
        of the obelisk on the Appian Way and probably composed the inscriptions 
        that were placed on its new base in the Piazza Navona. The book presented 
        his interpretation of the hieroglyphs of the obelisk, with rich, but necessarily 
        fantastic, documentation. </p>

      <p>Poggio copied down in notebooks inscriptions from the dozens of Roman 
        monuments which survived, often incorporated into churches and other buildings. 
        In time, the inscriptions would prove to be among the richest sources 
        of information for many areas of Roman history, from social life and funeral 
        customs to religious beliefs and political propaganda. But in Poggio's 
        day many were hard to read and all were vulnerable to attack from Rome's 
        heedless citizens. He was very proud of his firsthand record of these 
        materials, of which this manuscript preserves fragments. </p>

      <p>This image of the earliest stage in the development of Rome is much cruder 
        than Pietro del Massaio's. Though the unknown artist tried to represent 
        the small compass and exact contours of the early city, and labeled the 
        Forum and other places of note, the crenelated walls and towers reveal 
        the limits of his imagination. Unfortunately the text he illustrated was 
        even less accurate; it was a forgery by the papal theologian Giovanni 
        Nanni of Viterbo. </p>

      <p>Pierio Valeriano, one of the most cultivated Roman scholars in the decades 
        before the Sack of 1527, studied and edited Egyptian hieroglyphic lore 
        exhaustively. His book, derived from late Greek sources, tries to argue 
        that the symbolic wisdom of the Egyptians basically agrees with the fundamental 
        teachings of Christian theology and that the hieroglyphs were relics of 
        a separate Revelation. On display is a portrait of Valeriano. </p>
