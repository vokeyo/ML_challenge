Chapter III - The Accident

  Just after liftoff at .678 seconds into the flight, photographic
data show a strong puff of gray smoke was spurting from the vicinity
of the aft field joint on the right Solid Rocket Booster.  The two pad
39B cameras that would have recorded the precise location of the puff
were inoperative.  Computer graphic analysis of film from other
cameras indicated the initial smoke came from the 270 to 310-degree
sector of the circumference of the aft field joint of the right Solid
Rocket Booster.  This area of the solid booster faces the External
Tank.  The vaporized material streaming from the joint indicated there
was not complete sealing action within the joint.

  Eight more distinctive puffs of increasingly blacker smoke were
recorded between .836 and 2.500 seconds.  The smoke appeared to puff
upwards from the joint.  While each smoke puff was being left behind
by the upward flight of the Shuttle, the next fresh puff could be seen
near the level of the joint.  The multiple smoke puffs in this
sequence occurred at about four times per second, approximating the
frequency of the structural load dynamics and resultant joint flexing.
Computer graphics applied to NASA photos from a variety of cameras in
this sequence again placed the smoke puffs' origin in the 270- to
310-degree sector of the original smoke spurt.

  As the Shuttle increased its upward velocity, it flew past the
emerging and expanding smoke puffs.  The last smoke was seen above the
field joint at 2.733 seconds.

  The black color and dense composition of the smoke puffs suggest
that the grease, joint insulation and rubber O-rings in the joint seal
were being burned and eroded by the hot propellant gases.

  At approximately 37 seconds, Challenger encountered the first of
several high-altitude wind shear conditions, which lasted until about
64 seconds.  The wind shear created forces on the vehicle with
relatively large fluctuations.  These were immediately sensed and
countered by the guidance, navigation and control system.

  The steering system (thrust vector control) of the Solid Rocket
Booster responded to all commands and wind shear effects.  The wind
shear caused the steering system to be more active than on any
previous flight.

  Both the Shuttle main engines and the solid rockets operated at
reduced thrust approaching and passing through the area of maximum
dynamic pressure of 720 pounds per square foot.  Main engines had been
throttled up to 104 percent thrust and the Solid Rocket Boosters were
increasing their thrust when the first flickering flame appeared on
the right Solid Rocket Booster in the area of the aft field joint.
This first very small flame was detected on image enhanced film at
58.788 seconds into the flight.  It appeared to originate at about 305
degrees around the booster circumference at or near the aft field
joint.

  One film frame later from the same camera, the flame was visible
without image enhancement.  It grew into a continuous, well-defined
plume at 59.262 seconds.  At about the same time (60 seconds),
telemetry showed a pressure differential between the chamber pressures
in the right and left boosters.  The right booster chamber pressure
was lower, confirming the growing leak in the area of the field joint.

  As the flame plume increased in size, it was deflected rearward by
the aerodynamic slipstream and circumferentially by the protruding
structure of the upper ring attaching the booster to the External
Tank.  These deflections directed the flame plume onto the surface of
the External Tank.  This sequence of flame spreading is confirmed by
analysis of the recovered wreckage.  The growing flame also impinged
on the strut attaching the Solid Rocket Booster to the External Tank.

   The first visual indication that swirling flame from the right
Solid Rocket Booster breached the External Tank was at 64.660 seconds
when there was an abrupt change in the shape and color of the plume.
This indicated that it was mixing with leaking hydrogen from the
External Tank.  Telemetered changes in the hydrogen tank
pressurization confirmed the leak.  Within 45 milliseconds of the
breach of the External Tank, a bright sustained glow developed on the
black-tiled underside of the Challenger between it and the External
Tank.

  Beginning at about 72 seconds, a series of events occurred extremely
rapidly that terminated the flight.  Telemetered data indicate a wide
variety of flight system actions that support the visual evidence of
the photos as the Shuttle struggled futilely against the forces that
were destroying it.

   At about 72.20 seconds the lower strut linking the Solid Rocket
Booster and the External Tank was severed or pulled away from the
weakened hydrogen tank permitting the right Solid Rocket Booster to
rotate around the upper attachment strut.  This rotation is indicated
by divergent yaw and pitch rates between the left and right Solid
Rocket Boosters.

  At 73.124 seconds,. a circumferential white vapor pattern was
observed blooming from the side of the External Tank bottom dome.
This was the beginning of the structural failure of hydrogen tank that
culminated in the entire aft dome dropping away.  This released
massive amounts of liquid hydrogen from the tank and created a sudden
forward thrust of about 2.8 million pounds, pushing the hydrogen tank
upward into the intertank structure.  At about the same time, the
rotating right Solid Rocket Booster impacted the intertank structure
and the lower part of the liquid oxygen tank.  These structures failed
at 73.137 seconds as evidenced by the white vapors appearing in the
intertank region.

  Within milliseconds there was massive, almost explosive, burning of
the hydrogen streaming from the failed tank bottom and liquid oxygen
breach in the area of the intertank.

  At this point in its trajectory, while traveling at a Mach number of
1.92 at an altitude of 46,000 feet, the Challenger was totally
enveloped in the explosive burn.  The Challenger's reaction control
system ruptured and a hypergolic burn of its propellants occurred as
it exited the oxygen-hydrogen flames.  The reddish brown colors of the
hypergolic fuel burn are visible on the edge of the main fireball.
The Orbiter, under severe aerodynamic loads, broke into several large
sections which emerged from the fireball.  Separate sections that can
be identified on film include the main engine/tail section with the
engines still burning, one wing of the Orbiter, and the forward
fuselage trailing a mass of umbilical lines pulled loose from the
payload bay.
