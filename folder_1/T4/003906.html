</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">To start the work at St. Augustine, Queen Mariana
chose Don Manuel de Cendoya, gave him the governorship of Florida, and
sent him to Mexico City to confer with the Marqu&eacute;s de Mancera,
Viceroy of New Spain. Cendoya's first task was to collect the promised
12,000 pesos for starting the job, and that accomplishment he reported
in the middle of January 1671. The disquieting news of the English
settlement of Charleston gave point to his discussions with the
Marqu&eacute;s.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On his way to Florida, Cendoya stopped at Havana,
looking for skilled workmen&#151;masons and lime burners. There he found
an engineer, Ignacio Daza. It was on August 8, 1671, that the first
workman began to draw his pay. By the time the mosquitoes were sluggish
in the cooler fall weather, the coquina pits on Anastasia Island were
open, and two big limekilns were being built just north of the old fort.
The carpenters put up a palm-thatched shelter at the quarries; they
built a dozen large, square-end dug outs and laid rafts over them for
hauling stone for the fortification and fire wood and oyster shells for
the limekilns; and they built boxes, handbarrows, and <I>carretas</I>
(long, narrow, hauling wagons). At his anvil, the blacksmith made a
great noise, hammering out axes, picks, and stonecutters' hatchets, and
putting on their steel edges; drawing out the bars to the proper length
and flattening their ends for crowbars; working shapeless masses of iron
into shovels, spades, hoes, and wedges; and for lighter work, making
nails of all kinds and sizes for the carpenters. The grindstone
screeched as the cutting edges went on the tools.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In the quarries 3 leagues from the presidio, Indian
peons chopped out the dense thickets of scrub oak and palmetto, driving
out the rattlesnakes and clearing the ground for the shovelers to
uncover the top layer of coquina. Day after day Alonso Diaz, the quarry
overseer, kept the picks and axes going, cutting deep grooves into the
soft yellow stone, while with bar and wedge the peons broke loose and
pried up the rough blocks&#151;small pieces that a single man could
shoulder, and tremendously heavy, waterlogged cubes 2 feet thick and
twice as long that six strong men could hardly lift from the bed of
sandy shell. As a layer of stone was removed, again the shovelmen came
in, taking off the newly exposed bed of loose shell and uncovering yet
another and deeper stratum of rock. Down and down the quarrymen went
until their pits reached water and they could go no farther. Diaz
watched his peons heave the finest stone on the wagons. He sent the oxen
plodding to the wharf at the head of a marshy creek, and carefully
balanced the load of rough stone on the rafts for ferrying across
current to the building site. And on the opposite shore of the bay, next
to the old fort, the pile of unhewn stone daily grew larger, while the
stonecutters plied their squares and chopped unceasingly to shape the
soft coquina for the masons.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In the limekilns, oyster shells glowed white-hot and
changed into fine quality, quick-setting lime. By spring of 1672, there
were 4,000 <I>fanegas</I> (some 7,000 bushels) of lime in the two
storehouses, and the great piles of both hewn and rough stone were a
welcome sight to the people of St. Augustine.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
<IMG SRC="images/is1d.jpg" ALT="courtyard" BORDER="0"><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Most of the rooms open into the square courtyard or
parade of the fort. The well in this corner furnished the only palatable
water supply for refugees inside the fort during times of
siege.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Though it was only preparation for the main job,
great obstacles had already been overcome. Very little masonry had ever
been done in the presidio, and, with the exception of the imported
artisans, the workmen had to be trained. Even the imported ones had much
to learn about coquina, the natural shellrock peculiar to this section
of Florida. Coquina is nothing more than broken sea shells cemented
together by their own lime. Where the layer of shells has been under
great pressure, the rock is solid and hard; where pressure has been
less, the stone is coarse and easily crumbled. The men had to become
expert in grading the stone, for only the hardest and finest rock could
go into the fortification. There was also a shortage of common labor.
When there should have been 150 men to keep the 15 artisans working at
top speed&#151;50 in the quarries and hauling stone, 50 for gathering
oyster shells and helping at the kilns, and another 50 for digging the
foundation trenches, carrying the baskets of sand, and mixing
mortar&#151;it was hard to get as many as 100 laborers on the job.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Indians from three Nations, the Guale (Georgia),
Timucua (eastern Florida) and Apalache (western Florida), were called
upon for labor. Some of them had to travel 80 leagues to reach the
presidio. Many of them served unwillingly. There were serious domestic
problems, for these peons had the choice of bringing their families with
them or leaving the women and children in the home villages to eke out
their own living. In some cases, not even the chiefs were exempt from
the draft. In theory each complement of Indian labor served only a
certain length of time; in practice it was not uncommon for the men to
be held much beyond their assigned time, either through necessity or
carelessness. One wretched chief was forced to labor on the works for
more than 3 years without once returning to his own lands. Some of the
Indians were used as servants by the Governors. True, the Indians were
paid for their labor. Even the Apalaches, condemned years before to
labor on the fortifications as the penalty for rebellion, apparently
received a wage.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Indian peon was cheap labor&#151;1 real
(12-1/2&cent;) per day, plus rations of maize&#151;but he was not good
labor, for by nature the Indian was unfit for heavy work on a
European-style fortification. A brave might play the bone-breaking game
of Indian ball for a full day, but he could not stand up under the
"day-in, day-out," grinding, back-straining labor of the quarries. Not
all the Indians, however, were common laborers. A half dozen developed
into carpenters, and though they did not receive the top wage of 10 to
12 reales, they seemed well pleased with their 8 reales&#151;which was
twice what apprentice carpenters earned.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In addition to Indian labor, there were a few Spanish
peons who were paid 4 reales per day, a few of the Crown's Negro slaves,
and a number of convicts, either from the local presidio or sent from
Caribbean ports. The convicts served terms of varying length, depending
upon the nature of their crimes. A typical convict might have been the
Spaniard caught smuggling English goods into the colony, and he was
condemned to 6 years' labor on the fortifications at St. Augustine. If
he tried to escape, the term was doubled and he faced the grim prospect
of being sent to a fever-infested African presidio to work it out.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Spanish skilled labor included the military engineer,
Ignacio Daza, who was paid the top wage of 3 pesos per day. Daza died
within a year of his arrival in Florida, so the Crown paid only the
surprisingly small sum of 546 pesos (about $862) for engineering
services in starting the greatest of Spanish Florida fortifications. Of
the artisans, there were Lorenzo Lagones, master of construction, and a
pair of master masons, each of whom received the master workman's wage
of 20 reales (about $2.50) per day. In addition there were 7 masons at
12 reales, 8 stonecutters at the same rate, and a dozen carpenters whose
pay ranged from 6 to 12 reales per working day.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">There were few men for the job in hand, and to speed
the work along Governor Cendoya had to be ingenious and resourceful.
Constantly on the lookout for labor, he seized the opportunity of using
prisoners from the Carolina Colony, and, ironically enough, they were of
exceptional help in building this defense against their own countrymen.
Back in 1670, a vessel bound for Charleston Harbor accidentally put in
at Santa Catalina Mission, the Spanish frontier post near the Savannah
River. William Carr and John Rivers were captured. A rescue expedition
set out from Charleston, and when the sloop arrived at the Mission,
Joseph Bailey and John Collins took a blustering message ashore. For
their pains, they were dispatched with Rivers and Carr to St. Augustine.
There, from time to time, they were joined by other English
prisoners.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Governor did not long hesitate in putting them to
work. Three of the prisoners turned out to be masons, and the Spanish
form of their names&#151;Bernardo Patricio (for Bernard Patrick), Juan
Calens (for John Collins), and Guillermo Car (for William
Carr)&#151;appeared on the pay rolls. Some of the Englishmen entered
into the life of the presidio as permanent residents. At least one of
them took a Florida bride. Although the Spanish were cautious in
depending too much upon the fealty of these Englishmen to the Spanish
Crown, there was little occasion to denounce their unwillingness to
serve.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">John Collins especially pleased the Spanish
officials. He could burn more lime in a week than Spanish workmen could
in twice the time, and what was also to the point, as a prisoner he had
to be paid only 8 reales instead of the 20 due a master workman. This
Juan Calens appeared to like St. Augustine. He rose steadily in the
Crown's employ from master of the kilns to quarry master. Next he took
charge of the dugouts, the provisions, and the convicts. Eventually he
held even the important office of pilot from St. Augustine to
Charleston. Royal recognition of his zeal and loyalty was the
culmination of his 19 years or more of service in the presidio.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
<IMG SRC="images/is1e.jpg" ALT="plan of fort" BORDER="0"><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Salazar's plan of the Castillo shows construction to 1680.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Another unusual case developed a few years later.
Some leagues north of St. Augustine, 11 Englishmen were captured. All of
them except one Ransom were committed to the galleys. Ransom was to be
hanged. On the appointed day this man ascended the scaffold. The hangman
put the noose about his neck. The trap opened. The rope jerked taut,
then broke. Down tumbled Ransom, safe and sound. While the onlookers
marveled, the friars took it as an act of God and led Ransom to
sanctuary in the Convent of San Francisco. Word reached the Governor
that this man was an ingenious fellow, an artillerist, a carpenter, and,
what was most remarkable, a maker of "artificial fires." Ransom was
offered his life if he would leave sanctuary, live "protected" within
the fort, and put his talents to use. He agreed and, like Collins, was
exceedingly helpful, for none other in the presidio had such
abilities.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">All told, there were close to 150 men working in
those first days of feverish preparations. They, along with about 500
other persons, including about 100 effective soldiers in the garrison, a
few Franciscan friars, a dozen mariners, and the townspeople, had to be
fed. When supplies from New Spain did not arrive, the problem of
providing food was even more difficult than finding men to work on the
fort, especially since the sandy soil around the presidio yielded poorly
to the primitive agricultural practices of the seventeenth century.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Indian corn or maize was the staple, and most of the
planting, cultivating, and harvesting of the extensive fields near the
town was done by Indians brought from their provinces to do the work, so
that at times there were as many as 300 Indians serving the Crown in the
presidio, counting those at work on the fortification. The Indian peons
were furnished rations of maize both while they were in St. Augustine
and for their journey over the wilderness trails to their homes, and
certain of the convicts were also given a ration of Indian corn. This
native corn cost the Crown 7-1/2 reales per arroba (25 pounds) and an
arroba lasted the average Indian only 10 days.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Flour was imported from New Spain at a cost of 10
reales per arroba, and the master workmen, the English masons, and the
Spanish convicts were given rations from this store. In addition, these
convicts received a ration of meat. Fresh meat was not plentiful, but
the waters teemed with fish and there were plenty of shellfish. A paid
fisherman kept the men supplied. There were few garden vegetables.
Squash grew well in the sandy soil, and there were beans and
sweetpotatoes, citron, pomegranates, and figs. The orange had already
been introduced. And of course there were the favorite seasonings of
onion and garlic. Withal, however, it must be re membered that St.
Augustine was not a self-supporting settlement. After a century of
existence, it still depended for its very life upon the subsidy from New
Spain.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As the long, hot days of the second summer shortened
into fall, Governor Cendoya saw that after a year spent in gathering men
and materials he was ready to start construction.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">No long-drawn-out survey and detailed study helped to
locate the castillo, for the Spanish had learned their lessons by a
century and more of experiment on the shores of Matanzas Bay. Engineer
Daza and Governor Cendoya decided that the new fort should be erected on
the west shore of the bay by the side of the old fort, a site which took
into account every natural defense feature of the harbor. Here, the
enemy would find it almost impossible to bring his heavy siege guns
within range. A shallow bar at the channel entrance kept the bigger
warships out to sea. Any other vessel entering the harbor had to pass
under the fort guns. The town and the fort were on a narrow peninsula
surrounded on three sides by water or impassable marsh; the fourth
side&#151;the northern neck where the old fort stood&#151;was
constricted by a meandering creek. Beyond the marshes was
wilderness&#151;the pine barrens and cypress swamps, palmetto scrubs,
and oak groves. Roads were but Indian trails and the quickest passage
from one coastal fortified post to the next was along the inland
waterway in dugouts. Attackers might march quickly down the coast on the
wide, hard beaches (provided they could cross the numerous estuaries on
the way), but they were still faced with an advance over broad river and
marsh before they could reach the fort.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Nor was it a problem to work out the plan for the
castillo. Both Daza and the Governor liked the design of the old fort.
They, meeting with the General Council, decided merely to build the
castillo slightly larger in order to make room for quarters, guardroom,
chapel, wells, ovens, powder magazine, and other essential rooms not
included in the old fort. In line with the more recent ideas, Daza
recommended a slight lengthening of the bastions. All around the
castillo they planned to dig a broad, deep moat, and then surround the
land sides with a high palisade.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">It was a simple and unpretentious plan, but a good
one. Daza was apparently schooled in the Italian-Spanish principles of
fortification as developed from the sixteenth century designs of
Franceso de Marchi, for S&eacute;bastien de Vauban, the great French
engineer, was still but a young man in 1671. Little is known about
Ignacio Daza, but if he were the typical military engineer, he was
nothing if not practical. And Daza, if he were typical, was more than a
draftsman. For a military engineer, it was "not sufficient to know how
to draw plans, profils and landskips; to understand a few propositions
in geometry, or to know how to build a wall or a house; on the contrary,
he ought to be well grounded in all the most useful branches of the
mathematics, and how to apply them to practice, natural philosophy, and
architecture; have a good notion of all kind of handicraft works; and
above all things, to be well versed in mechanics."</P>
