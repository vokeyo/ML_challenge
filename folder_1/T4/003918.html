****:FRESHWATER SPONGES

To most people the word sponge means a chunk of porous material&nbsp;
used for mopping and washing -- remarkable for its power to absorb&nbsp;
water and to become soft and pliable when wet without losing its&nbsp;
toughness. Actually, such a sponge is the skeleton of a low form of&nbsp;
marine animal that lives rooted to one spot like a vegetable. This&nbsp;
skeleton is a fine fibrous network made of a substance similar to horn or&nbsp;
fingernails. Among about 3000 species of sponges found in the sea,&nbsp;
only three have much commercial value -- the bath sponge, the horse&nbsp;
sponge and the sheep's wool sponge. Divers or dredges tear these from&nbsp;
the rocky floors of warm shallow seas such as the Mediterranean and&nbsp;
the Gulf of Mexico. After they have been allowed to die and rot on a&nbsp;
ship's deck, they are trampled, beaten and washed until the jelly-like&nbsp;
flesh is all removed. Other kinds are too small or too fragile to be used,&nbsp;
or else have skeletons made of brittle scratchy substance like lime or&nbsp;
silica.

Once thought to be plants, sponges were not clearly recognized as&nbsp;
members of the animal kingdom until the 19th century. They have such&nbsp;
irregular shapes, even within one species, that they look like some&nbsp;
spreading underwater mold or fungus. This is particularly true of the&nbsp;
freshwater sponges of which about thirty kinds are known in North&nbsp;
America. In Illinois a half dozen species of these are widespread in&nbsp;
clean ponds, lakes, streams and rivers where they form mat-like,&nbsp;
encrusting growths on submerged rocks, pebbles, logs, twigs, and the&nbsp;
undersides of lily pads. The different kinds when full-grown range in&nbsp;
size from a tiny slimy patch the size of a postage stamp to rough, inch-
thick mats with finger-like outgrowths covering many square yards.&nbsp;
Usually brown, gray or yellowish in color, some may become bright&nbsp;
green in sunlight due to an alga that grows in their jelly-like innards.

The sponge's body is very simply constructed. It has no brain, nerves,&nbsp;
muscles, eyes, heart, gills or other organs. Examined under a&nbsp;
microscope, you see large numbers of very small pores scattered over&nbsp;
the surface and a few large openings the size of pin heads, usually at the&nbsp;
tips of bumps. Inside the body these openings are connected by a maze&nbsp;
of channels and chambers. The latter are lined with special cells with&nbsp;
tiny whips that lash the water and cause a flow in through the small&nbsp;
openings and out through the larger ones. The entire animal is a sort of&nbsp;
sieve to catch the microscopic life and debris which nourish it. In the&nbsp;
course of a day, a sponge the size of your hand may strain many gallons&nbsp;
of water.

With the exception of a thin skin covering the outside of the body and&nbsp;
the inside of the channels, most of the body is a watery jelly containing&nbsp;
many creeping shapeless cells that perform a variety of tasks. They&nbsp;
manufacture the minute spines and fibers that make up the skeleton;&nbsp;
they digest food, carry oxygen and can even change into eggs and&nbsp;
sperms. Like many other lower animals, sponges have remarkable&nbsp;
powers of regeneration. Even when ground up and squeezed through a&nbsp;
cloth the minute fragments creep together in a dish of water and rebuild&nbsp;
a new sponge. In autumn freshwater sponges die after they form little&nbsp;
thick-shelled, seed-like bodies called gemmules. Immune to freezing&nbsp;
and drying, these can be carried by wind, by water or on the feet of&nbsp;
birds to other ponds and streams to produce next year's sponges.

Sponges got stuck in an evolutionary blind alley.
