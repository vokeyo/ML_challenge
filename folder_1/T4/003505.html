&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Flea beetles, and leaf beetles as a whole, are morphologically poorly
	known. Some of the more important literature dealing with
	morphological structures at the family level are contained in the
	works of Kasap and Crowson (1979, 1985), Suzuki (1988,1994) and
	Samuelson (1994). A number of works exist which describe the
	morphology of a single species or genus of Alticinae (Teotia 1958,
	Reid 1988, Konstantinov in press), but these works are too few and
	their scope too limited to allow for the determination of complex
	structural homologies within the subfamily. There are a few works
	comparing the morphology of a single structure across several
	genera (Furth 1989 - metafemoral spring, Konstantinov and Lopatin
	1987 - metendosternite), and a single attempt (Konstantinov 1994)
	to analyze evolutionary trends in diverse morphological structures
	of Palearctic genera. Furth and Suzuki (1994) use morphological
	structures to determine the correct subfamily position of various
	enigmatic genera. Konstantinov (1987b), and Kangas and Rutanen
	(1993) explore the use of novel morphological characters for
	species determination in "difficult" genera.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A compendium of
	morphological terminology is presented to serve as a general
	reference work, and to assist in the interpretation of the
	descriptions and keys. With a few noted changes, we have adapted
	the nomenclature proposed by earlier authors.<P>
<B>Head</B> (Figs. <A HREF="morp244.htm">1-3</a> and <A
	HREF="morp245.htm">4-6</a>)<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three important regions of the
	flea beetle head, common to Coleoptera in general, are the
	epicranium, epistome and basicranium (sensu Du Porte 1960, Matsuda
	1965, sensu Kryzhanovsky 1983). The epicranium consists of the
	vertex, frons and gena. The frons is usually recognizable as a
	distinct ridge, separated from the gena by the frontogenal suture
	(<A HREF="morp245.htm">Fig. 4</A>). The vertex is situated dorsal to 
	the frons and sometimes
	delimited by a transfrontal suture. Usually there are two raised
	areas on the lower part of the vertex known as antennal calli. Du
	Porte (1960) named the region of the vertex bearing these calli
	the epifrons. For the purpose of our key and descriptions we have
	defined the area between the vertex and basicranium as the "facial
	part" of the head (<A HREF="morp245.htm">Fig. 4</A>) .<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The epistome 
	is situated on the
	anterior margin of the head, delineated from it by the
	frontoclypeal suture. This suture is indistinct in the majority of
	Palearctic flea beetles.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basicranium (<A
	HREF="morp245.htm">Fig. 6</A>) consists of the combined gula and
	submentum, situated on the midventral part of the head capsule
	between the gular and hypostomal sutures. There are two posterior
	tentorial pits at the juncture of these two sutures.<P>
<B>Mouth parts</B> (Figs. <A HREF="morp245.htm">7-10</a> and <A
	HREF="morp246.htm">11-12</a>)<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mouth parts consist of a
	labrum, labium, and the paired mandibles and maxillae.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
	alticine labrum is a flat, sclerotised, rectangular structure with
	two posterolateral elongated tormae (<A HREF="morp245.htm#fig8to10">Fig. 8</A>) and numerous marginal
	setae on the anterior margin. The upper surface has a number
	(usually 6) of symmetrically placed setiferous pores.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
	mandibles are highly sclerotised, symmetrical structures with
	triangular bases. The apex of this triangle is situated ventrally
	(<A HREF="morp245.htm#fig8to10">Fig. 9</A>). The outer surface is strongly convex and has very
	complicated sculpturing. The inner surface is strongly concave
	with a membranous prostheca covered by many small setae. The
	absence of a mola (with the probable exception of Blepharida,
	Ophrida, and Podontia) is one of the more notable features of the
	alticine mandible. There are 5 mandibular teeth in the majority of
	Palearctic flea beetles.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maxilla of flea beetles consists
	of a basal segment (cardo), basi- and mediastypes, galea, and
	lacinia; a 4-segmented maxillary palpus is attached to each
	basistipe. The basal segment of the palpus is usually very small
	(<A
	HREF="morp246.htm">Fig. 11</A>).<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flea beetle prementum is attached
	to the mentum
	and bears a pair of 3-segmented palpi, which differ in morphology
	from genus to genus (<A
	HREF="morp246.htm">Fig. 12</A>).<P>
<B>Antennae</B> (Figs. <A HREF="morp246.htm#fig13to16">13-16</a>)<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alticine
	antennae are usually 11-segmented and filiform. Only 2 genera
	differ in segment number: Psylliodes and Nonarthra have 10 and 9
	segments, respectively. The antennae of Nonarthra are serrated. In
	some genera living on the soil near plant roots (e.g. Mniophila,
	Orestia) the antennae have acquired a moniliform structure.<P>
<B>Thorax</B> (Figs. <A HREF="morp247.htm">17-21</a> and <A
	HREF="morp248.htm">22-25</a>)<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For thoracic structures we have
	adapted the terminology proposed by Snodgrass (1935), Crowson,
	(1938, 1944) and Hlavac (1972).<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prothorax of the Alticinae
	is a highly sclerotized structure nearly lacking sutures. In
	several genera, the pronotum has a transverse antebasal impression
	and/or two short, laterally placed impressions. The lateral
	infolded portions of the pronotum, visible in a ventral view, are
	the hypomera. It is important to mention that the flea beetle
	prothorax lacks visible pleura. The prosternum is usually narrow,
	especially the intercoxal prosternal process. The procoxal
	cavities are termed "closed" if the inner hypomeral projection
	touches the posterolateral part of the intercoxal prosternal
	process.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meso- and metathoraces have
	been neglected as
	sources of diagnostic or phylogenetic characters. In figures 19-22
	we have simply labeled some of the more prominent morphological
	features.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The metendosternite is an internal
	structure, attached to the posterior margin of the metasternum 
	between the	metacoxal cavities (<A
	HREF="morp248.htm">Fig. 23</A>). This structure is useful for
	extrapolating intergeneric relationships. It also provides
	important characters for generic identification (Konstantinov and
	Lopatin 1987).<P>
<B>Wings and appendages</B> (<A HREF="morp249.htm">Fig. 26</a>)<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elytra (= mesothoracic wings) of
	Alticinae exhibit a large
	diversity of surface sculpturing. Sometimes they are covered by
	irregularly placed punctures, or with punctures arranged in
	striae. The interspaces between striae can be minutely punctate
	and/or shagreened.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The metathoracic wing venation is a popular
	subject for comparative morphological studies at the family level.
	The commonly accepted terminology (Suzuki 1994) is given on <A HREF="morp249.htm">figure
	26</A>.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legs of flea beetles consist of coxae, trochanters,
	femora, tibiae and tarsi (<A
	HREF="morp244.htm">Fig. 1</A>). The hind femora are usually
	strongly swollen and contain the metafemoral spring (Maulik 1929).
	The hind tibiae are useful for generic identification.<P>
<B>Abdomen</B> (<a href="morp244.htm">Fig. 1</a> and <A HREF="morp249.htm#fig27">Figs. 27-28</a>)<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ventral
	part of the flea beetle abdomen consists of 5 visible sternites.
	The primordial first sternite has become lost in the evolution of
	the Alticinae. The first visible sternite is composed of the fused
	second and third true sternites. The dorsal part of the abdomen
	consists of 7 membranous tergites. The 8th and the 9th segments
	are telescoped within the abdomen and variously modified in the
	different genders.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The male internal genitalia (<A
	HREF="morp249.htm#fig27">Fig. 27</a>), consisting of a penis and
	significantly reduced tegmen, is one of the most important
	diagnostic features for species identification.<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chitinized
	structures of the female genitalia (<A
	HREF="morp249.htm#fig28">Fig. 28</a>) are the modified 8th and 9th abdominal
	segments, but their homology and terminology is poorly known
	(Lindroth 1957, Teotia 1958, Konnerth & Juga 1963, Konstantinov
	1994). All tergites have preserved the plate shape, but the
	sternites are represented by the highly modified vaginal palps ( =
	styli in part sensu Konstantinov 1994) and tignum. The vaginal
	palps are elongate sclerotized structures contained within the
	vagina and attached to the inner wall of its dorsal surface. All
	the structures of the female genitalia appear to be very useful
	for studying intergeneric relationships and for species
	identification. The spermatheca can also be used for species
	identification, but only in some genera where its intraspecific
	variability is fairly well known.
