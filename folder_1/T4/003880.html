<H2 align=center>Learning to Read Rome's Ruins</H2>
<hr>
<P>
Between 1450 and 1600 ancient Rome began to emerge from beneath
the shapeless pastures and deserted hills of the ancient city. 
Renaissance scholars identified major sites and buildings.  They
began the great effort of copying the ancient inscriptions that
made the city itself a vast, if fragmentary, textbook about Roman
history and life.  By the middle of the fifteenth century,
scholars in the curia--like the brilliant architect Leon Battista
Alberti and the erudite scholar Flavio Biondo--knew the ancient
city better than anyone had for a thousand years.  Artists
recorded the ruins that survived, broken and ivy-covered, and
reconstructed the original palaces and temples in all their
crisp-edged glory.  Architects tried to grasp the rules and
methods of the Roman builders.  When ancient works of art, like
the Laocoon, came to light they immediately became famous and
influential, finding prominent places in the sculpture
collections that adorned the Capitoline hill, the Belvedere court
of the Vatican, and many private houses.  Drawn and printed
images of them circulated throughout Europe and scholars and
artists made pilgrimages to Rome to see them.  By the middle of
the sixteenth century, Roman scholars had recreated the whole web
and texture of ancient Roman life, from its physical environment
to its religious rituals, in astonishingly vivid detail.  True,
not even papal support could stop the destruction of individual
monuments and buildings; much continued to be lost or scattered. 
The study of the ruins prospered even as buildings were torn down
or burnt to make lime.  In the course of the sixteenth century,
Roman archaeologists shed new light on the Egyptian and early
Christian worlds as well as on Rome itself.

By the fourteenth century, Italian intellectuals were becoming
fascinated by the physical as well as the literary relics of the
ancient world.  Rome, of course, had the grandest of all ruins,
at which medieval pilgrims had long marvelled.  The Roman in the
street was happy to provide misinformation about sites and
statues, but in the Renaissance, scholars began to measure,
excavate, and identify the statues and buildings that had long
amazed travellers.  True, much was lost forever.  When Poggio
Bracciolini and a friend climbed the Capitoline Hill in 1430, the
vast view that opened out before them was a desert; the ancient
forum was populated only by pigs, deer, and vegetables.  But by
the end of the fifteenth century, Roman scholars had identified
the sites of many lost buildings, compiled notebooks bulging with
information, and begun to recreate the ancient city.

Giovanni de Matociis (d. 1337), known as Giovanni Mansionario
because of his official office in the cathedral at Verona, used
the very rich library preserved there to splendid effect.  A
prescient scholar, he proved that there had been not one but two
Plinys, the elder who wrote the <em>Natural History</em> and the younger
who described the elder's death in the eruption of Vesuvius. 
Both his erudition and his critical skills served him well in the
writing of his immense <em>Historia imperialis,</em> a biographical
compilation that began with Augustus.  He shows a real interest
in trying to recreate ancient Roman life in three dimensions, as
3~is clear from his stiff but fascinating marginal drawings of
emperors' heads (derived from Roman coins) and a Roman circus
(which he based not on the remains of the Arena in Verona but on
textual information from a late antique encyclopedia).

Many Roman families took a deep interest in the exploration of
ancient ruins.  Cristoforo Buondelmonti dedicated this treatise
on his adventurous exploration of the islands of the Aegean to
Cardinal Giordano Orsini in 1420.  All extant manuscripts are
copies of the original, nonetheless the illustrations suggest the
nostalgic and obsessive love for the classical past that made
Buondelmonte risk capture by pirates and death from starvation. 
Here, carefully drawn ruins evoke the pathos of what he took to
be the ruins of Troy.

Pomponio Leto, a famous teacher as well as a brilliant antiquary,
lectured in Rome on many classical texts, including the work of

Archaeology was a field where scholars and artists collaborated. 
The brilliant Leon Battista Alberti, Nicholas V's architectural
adviser, roamed the entire city in order to learn how the Romans
had built.  His own book on architecture, the first modern one,
offered modern readers a vast amount of archaeological
information.  In the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, more
and more classical works of art came to light, and artists joined
the pious in making pilgrimages to Rome.  From tiny manuscript
illuminations to huge systematic sketchbooks, the artists' record
of the ancient city eloquently reveals the reverence and
fascination that antiquity inspired.

These fragments of what seems to have been Leto's field notebook

zodiac through which the sun passed, gave the lengths of days and
nights, listed the agricultural tasks and religious festivals
appropriate to each month, and provided other important
information, like the dates of the solstices and equinoxes.  The
Roman calendar was complex, sophisticated, and steeped in beliefs
deeply rooted in the Roman past.  Leto's discovery, now known as
the <em>Menologium rusticum Vallense,</em> was a major addition to the
humanists' stock of knowledge about Roman practices and beliefs.

Renaissance archaeologists loved Roman culture, but they were
also fascinated by Rome's great, mysterious relics of ancient
Egypt:  the obelisks, some of them inscribed with mysterious
hieroglyphs, that Roman emperors had brought across the
Mediterranean.  One of these relics, at once threatening and
magnificent, was still standing by the Vatican; others were
discovered underground.  Scholars tried to understand their
messages and functions.  The imperious pope Sixtus V had five of
them raised--a job so hard that Michelangelo had refused to
undertake it.  Once formally exorcised of their evil spirits, the
obelisks clearly showed that Christianity had overtaken Rome and
Egypt alike in power and glory.  Still other archaeologists
penetrated the buried early Christian tombs in the catacombs
under the city, making adventurous trips into the dark to find a
whole lost world of early Christian symbolism and imagery.

This notebook was made by no fewer than five artists working
under the direction of an expert on early Christianity, Alfonso
Chacon, in the late sixteenth century.  Inspired by the need to
defend Catholicism against Protestant attacks, Roman scholars
studied the early Christian art of the catacombs.  They
identified some basic themes and conventions of early Christian
art, such as the frequent representation of Christ as a shepherd. 
The artists' skill was not great, however, and some images--like
the revival of Lazarus pictured here--are almost unrecognizable.

The manuscript shows that Carlo Baronio inserted his reference to

Casaubon--into the text of his church history only after he had

authentically classical to many readers, incorporated genuine
Roman ruins and reliefs.  The book did much to spread a taste for

right), can readily be identified.

<P>

The formidably learned Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher, directed the
excavation of the obelisk on the Appian Way and probably composed
the inscriptions that were placed on its new base in the Piazza
Navona.  The book presented his interpretation of the hieroglyphs
of the obelisk, with rich, but necessarily fantastic,
documentation.

Printed collections like this one by Bartolomeo Marliani
presented the chief antiquities of Rome to a European public.  In
this case we see the Laocoon, a famous group of sculptures
discovered early in the sixteenth century and displayed in the
Vatican gardens.

Inscriptions</a> 
<dd><em>Fifteenth century</em></dl> <P>

Poggio copied down in notebooks inscriptions from the dozens of
Roman monuments which survived, often incorporated into churches
and other buildings.  In time, the inscriptions would prove to be
among the richest sources of information for many areas of Roman
history, from social life and funeral customs to religious
beliefs and political propaganda.  But in Poggio's day many were
hard to read and all were vulnerable to attack from Rome's
heedless citizens.  He was very proud of his firsthand record of
these materials, of which this manuscript preserves fragments.

<P>

This image of the earliest stage in the development of Rome is
much cruder than Pietro del Massaio's.  Though the unknown artist
tried to represent the small compass and exact contours of the
early city, and labeled the Forum and other places of note, the
crenelated walls and towers reveal the limits of his imagination. 
Unfortunately the text he illustrated was even less accurate; it
was a forgery by the papal theologian Giovanni Nanni of Viterbo.

Bosio, who used only two artists, produced fairly reliable
records and images in his book on the underground city of the
catacombs, which remained standard for two centuries.

<dd><em>Basel<br> 1556</em></dl> 
<P>

Pierio Valeriano, one of the most cultivated Roman scholars in
the decades before the Sack of 1527, studied and edited Egyptian
hieroglyphic lore exhaustively.  His book, derived from late
Greek sources, tries to argue that the symbolic wisdom of the
Egyptians basically agrees with the fundamental teachings of
Christian theology and that the hieroglyphs were relics of a
separate Revelation.  On display is a portrait of Valeriano.
