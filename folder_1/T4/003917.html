									</b></font><b><font face="arial">Through the years we&rsquo;ve seen exercises and equipment make dramatic leaps, but right alongside are the articles of clothing we wear for workouts.<br>
										<br>
									</font></b>There has always been an emphasis on the importance of staying active, but as we move from the past to the present and look into the near future, the trends of working out and workout attire continue to evolve.<p>Today we see advancements in equipment, more emphasis on body &ldquo;zones,&rdquo; and even fitness that impacts mental wellness and healthy lifestyles. Along those lines, the clothes we wear for working out continue to change right along with the equipment and routines.</p>
								<p><img src="http://montgomerycountymd.gov/content/rec/RECord/images/shubert_logo_fitness.jpg" alt="" align="left" border="0">It all began in World War II as soldiers trained for combat. Physical fitness was an enormous priority and the residual of Allied victory was the beginning of a fitness revolution in the U.S. After the war, veterans brought home a culture of exercise that started with the basics, such as the single bench-press and a few dumbbells in a home garage. The attire? Usually cotton shorts, no shirt and sneakers&#151;that is, if you wore shoes during your &ldquo;workout.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>The 1960s brought health clubs that attracted not only professional, amateur and recreational athletes, but everyday people simply looking to get in or stay in shape. Many health clubs provided amenities including steam rooms, lounge areas, swimming pools, free weights, and a variety of makeshift free-weight equipment. Women started joining the gym trend along with wearing leotard outfits that were no longer just for ballet classes.</p>
								<p>As for equipment, the renaissance began in the 1970s with the craze for interval training that included running and cycling. The first stationary bike emerged in gyms and for home use, too. The Nautilus weight system changed gyms over night.</p>
								<p>When the movie &ldquo;Rocky&rdquo; captured America&rsquo;s heart in 1976, boxer Rocky Balboa&rsquo;s workout attire created a trend toward many layers of cotton clothes. Premise: The more layers, the more you sweat and burn calories. Today, we know that method only makes us overheated and lose water weight.</p>
								<p>In the 1980s, the exercise industry exploded with new activities such as step aerobics, stair-climbing machines, elliptical cross-trainers, cross-country ski machines, aerobic riders and aquatic exercise. With more celebrities posing to promote certain exercise machines, &rsquo;80s workout clothes became a fashion category, featuring Lycra and bright colors. But the focus was on style, not sport-specific or comfort.</p>
								<p>Health clubs flourished in the &rsquo;90s and started to integrate into hotels, colleges, corporations, apartment complexes, hospitals, firehouses and police stations. County recreation facilities were now not only used for basic gym use, but had a separate fitness room with weight and cardiovascular equipment. The popularity of sport-specific magazines targeted sport-specific workout attire, such as mesh or padded shorts, spandex, clip-pedal cycling shoes, and better quality running shoes and support.</p>
								<p>Finally, in 1995, University of Maryland football player Kevin Plank grew tired of shapeless, cotton T-shirts, which kept him damp and sluggish while working out. This finally started the revolutionary turn from style to workout attire that is stylish <em>and</em> comfortable.</p>
								<p>Plank's ground-breaking idea: an undershirt made from stretchy synthetic material that keeps its shape and color and wicks sweat off the body. Thus, Under Armour was born. Athletes can stay cool in summer or warm in winter. The concept expanded to not only t-shirts, but shorts, socks, and under garments. What continues to make this fabric the choice for customers is cotton soaks up the water and dries slowly versus synthetic material, which is lighter and, when wet, dries faster.</p>
								<p>After all these years of fitness advancements and innovations, Plank&rsquo;s idea for athletic wear brings home a fitness message that no one really considered for 50 years: if you feel comfortable, you will perform better.</p>

										</b></font><strong><font size="-1" face="arial">Advancement in fitness and equipment have also made the journey to workout clothing. A look at the basics of attire for your routine:</font></strong></p>
								<p><font size="-1" color="#660000" face="arial"><b>Attire&#151;</b></font><font size="-1" face="arial">Cotton is out! The natural fabric holds onto the sweat and when working out you want a fabric that keeps sweat away from the skin. Keep the spandex shorts for cycling (indoor or outside) and the bathing suits in the pool.</font></p>
								<p><img src="http://montgomerycountymd.gov/content/rec/RECord/images/july2008/fitness_attire.jpg" alt="The clothing you wear can make a big difference in your workout comfort." align="right" border="0"><font size="-1" color="#660000" face="arial"><b>Feel Comfortable&#151;</b></font><font size="-1" face="arial">If you feel comfortable in your workout attire, you will move easier and workout more efficient. Don&rsquo;t wear anything that will make you feel like you can&rsquo;t breathe (sweat trapped) or may create friction in places that will leave you uncomfortable for days.</font></p>
								<p><strong><font size="-1" color="#660000" face="arial">Dress in Layers</font></strong><font size="-1" color="#660000" face="arial"><b>&#151;</b></font><font size="-1" face="arial">Wearing a pull-over that looks like a trash bag will not help you lose weight faster, but it will make you overheated and dehydrated. Choose a base layer that is breathable and top layers easy to remove as your body thermoregulates.</font></p>
								<p><font size="-1" color="#660000" face="arial"><b>Be Sport Specific&#151;</b></font><font size="-1" face="arial">You don&rsquo;t wear padded spandex cycling shorts to go for a jog and you don't wear high-top shoes to run in. Wearing the proper, sport-specific clothing that is made for your activity will help you feel and perform better.</font></p>
								<p><font size="-1" color="#660000" face="arial"><b>Accessorize&#151;</b></font><font size="-1" face="arial">Not only does the clothing have to work with your workout, but having places for keys, water bottles, music, etc helps keeps your workouts efficient. You can now find belts for the waist to hold water bottles or around the arm for I-Pods, leaving your hands free or your pants pockets to hold small items such as a money clip or car keys.</font></p>
