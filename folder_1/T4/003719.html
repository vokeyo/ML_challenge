          SACCAR/AfricaLink Southern Africa Program<br>
          Gaborone, February 1-7, 1997</h3>
		  
		  <b><center>Jeffrey A. Cochrane<br>

<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
<p>
SACCAR has made substantial progress in its Internet connectivity program, and must now turn
to the arguably more difficult task of information management.  An email address is not the goal,
but rather a means.  The sharing of knowledge for more effective programs is the goal.  General
Recommendations:
<ul>

<li>To manage information effectively, SACCAR must consider carefully the structure of its
information management department.  The SACCAR information manager must be free
to organize the information resources of SACCAR for effective presentation to
stakeholders.  This may require a redefinition of responsibilities.<p>

<li>SANGONeT and SACCAR: A working relationship was established, detailing how tasks
would be defined and funded.  SANGONeT's Southern Africa Help Desk staff, Mr.
Na'eem Jeenah, was introduced to staff of the RCSA.<p>

<li>SACCAR LAN and Internet: The SACCAR CC:Mail LAN is now operational.  A UUCP
link was established with an account through Info-Botswana, after technical difficulties
were encountered with the SADC system.  The &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt; subdomain name will
be requested from SADC, but the &lt;saccar.info.bw&gt; name is available now.<p>

<li>SACCAR Information Management: A program of services to be offered by SACCAR
using Internet technologies was proposed, including a Web site, online publications, and
Web-based database information retrieval.<p>

<li>SACCAR Training Program: Four general types of trainings were proposed-- service
provider practicums, online tutorials (distance learning), local workshops in partnership
with the private sector, and regional workshop add-ons.<p>

<li>SACCAR Connectivity Program: Among the 76 individuals targeted under the program,
54 are connected with electronic mail addresses, while 22 remain unconnected.  The
status of each country is reviewed.  An email directory is attached.
</ul>

<h3> SACCAR/AfricaLink Southern Africa Program<br>
Gaborone, February 1-7, 1997</h3>
<p>
The AfricaLink Advisor visited Gaborone, Botswana, for consultations with the AfricaLink
liaison, Mr. Christopher Lungu, at the Southern African Centre for Cooperation in Agricultural
and Natural Resources Research and Training (SACCAR).  SACCAR receives substantial
financial support from the USAID Regional Center for Southern Africa (RCSA), including funds
for communications and information dissemination.  SACCAR is allocating some of these funds
to foster electronic networking in the region.

<h4> General Recommendations</h4>
<p>
SACCAR has made substantial progress in its Internet connectivity program, and must now turn
to the arguably more difficult task of information management.  An email address is not the goal,
but rather a means.  The sharing of knowledge for more effective programs is the goal.<br>
<p>
To manage information effectively, SACCAR must reconsider carefully the structure of its
information management department. As presently organized, it does not appear as if SACCAR
is prepared to undertake many of the tasks proposed in this report.
<p>
One suggestion for staff reorganization is as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Chief of Information Management: Primary design of information presentations to
stakeholders and the public, consultant to primary producers of information for complex
problems with database software, direction of staff for information dissemination; reports
to senior management.<p>

<li>
Assistant for Information Management: Document layout and typesetting, final
proofreading, distribution, routine assistance to senior and clerical staff with word
processing problems; reports to Chief of Information Management.<p>

<li>
Clerical staff: Routine typing, initial proofreading; reports primarily 
to Assistant for Information Management. 
</ul>
<p>
This proposed reorganization will require cooperation from senior 
staff. Senior staff should not, for example, expect the information 
manager to be available for routine proofreading of documents. If 
junior staff cannot handle this task, the skills of junior staff should 
be upgraded or new staff should be engaged for this purpose.
<p>
The information manager of SACCAR should take care to document and inform senior
management when his attentions are being diverted from the central mission of the information
department.  For this purpose, it is proposed that a time-task study of daily activities be taken
periodically and presented to senior management.  This can be done internally, and should not
require an outside study to be commissioned.  AfricaLink/Washington can assist with the
formulation of such a study if requested, or information staff of USAID/RCSA might assist with
an assessment.

<h4> SANGONeT and SACCAR</h4>
<p>
Mr. Na'eem Jeenah was introduced to staff of SACCAR and the RCSA.  Mr. Jeenah will serve as
the AfricaLink principal point of contact at SANGONeT, staffing the SANGONeT Southern
Africa Help Desk.  This Help Desk will serve SANGONeT partners in the region.  USAID is
supporting this Help Desk with special funding for the support of organizations and institutions
in the region involved in agriculture, the environment, and natural resource management.
<p>
USAID funding for the Help Desk originates with the RCSA, and is managed by AfricaLink
through the USAID division of Information Resources Management (IRM).  The RCSA intends
that this support be directed primarily to agricultural and natural resource management research
networks associated with SACCAR, as well as to the environmental program members of the
World Conservation Union's Regional Office for Southern Africa (IUCN-ROSA).
<p>
Budget line-items are flexible, but as initially formulated, the following is available:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$38,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Startup Assistance Packages (Modems, Installation, etc.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$7,000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional Workshops (Materials Development, Presentation)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$20,000
&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Support Desk (SANGONeT, possibly one other)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$14,000
&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem Site Visits (Regional Travel)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$9,000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AfricaLink Advisor Travel (Planning, Oversight, Evaluation)
<p>
This program is new.  Should it show merit, the RCSA has indicated an interest in providing
further funds.
<p>
SANGONeT will be the implementing agency for some of these funds under a task-order
contract.  Initial task orders call for one labor-hour per day of technical support from the
Southern Africa Help Desk, and for development of a workshop proposal.  Additional task orders
will be written based on consultations among SACCAR, IUCN-ROSA, SANGONeT, and
AfricaLink/Washington.
<p>
A procedure by which task orders will be generated was discussed.  All parties will consult
regularly and develop tasks collaboratively.  However, it is expected that SACCAR will take the
lead in identifying particular needs among its member networks that require AfricaLink support. 
For its part, AfricaLink/Washington will assure that funds are sufficient for any tasks proposed,
and will coordinate SACCAR proposals with those of IUCN-ROSA.  AfricaLink/Washington
will also seek ways the limited funds available from the RCSA can be combined with those of
others to achieve common ends, e.g. with the Association for Progressive Communications, and
with other USAID-funded organizations.  The RCSA will provide clearance for specific task
orders.  Provided SANGONeT agrees to undertake a proposed task, the task order will be signed
between SANGONeT and SETA Corporation.  SETA holds the AfricaLink contract for
USAID/IRM.

<h4> SACCAR Headquarters LAN and Internet Link</h4>
<p>
Mr. Christopher Lungu is responsible for computer networking at SACCAR headquarters.  The
SACCAR headquarters LAN runs under Windows for Workgroups, and has recently been
upgraded with an office-wide CC:Mail system installed by a local consultant, Mr. Steve Jump. 
A UUCP gateway package has also been installed.  It remains to identify an appropriate UUCP
host service to which to link SACCAR's LAN for electronic mail access to every workstation.

<p>
Difficulties have been encountered with the UUCP host operated by SADC.  Mr. Lungu has
therefore decided to utilize the services of Info-Botswana, a local commercial Internet service
provider.  In the months since installing the CC:Mail system at SACCAR, Mr. Jump has become
one of the owners of Info-Botswana, and so a business relationship already exists.  Info-
Botswana presently charges about $80 per month for an enterprise-level post office account
accessed via UUCP.  An additional dial-up PPP account is to be provided at no additional
charge.  These prices are quite reasonable, if not somewhat low, by African standards.

<p>
It was suggested by the AfricaLink Advisor that SACCAR obtain and register its own Internet
subdomain, &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt;.  There are numerous reasons for this, requiring digression into
technical details, which are therefore explained in the appendix.  In short, having its own
subdomain creates an Internet identity for SACCAR, and also will permit SACCAR to change its
service provider without changing its address on business cards and stationary.

<p>
The &lt;sadc.int&gt; domain is already registered through UUNet in South Africa, and so the addition
of the &lt;saccar&gt; subdomain should be a relatively simple matter, requiring the agreement of the
responsible party at SADC.  While more complicated and expensive, SACCAR may also choose
to register its own domain &lt;saccar.int&gt; with the international registry in the United States.  Mr.

<p>
Jump of Info-Botswana will handle the particulars, presumably for a small or no fee.

<p>
The initial SACCAR address will be &lt;any.user@saccar.info.bw&gt;, a standard Info-Botswana
address with a SACCAR subdomain.  Upon registration through SADC, users at SACCAR will
also be accessible through &lt;any.user@saccar.sadc.int&gt;, e.g. b.ndunguru@saccar.sadc.int. 
Organizational usernames for various purposes can also be freely created, such as
secretariat@saccar.sadc.int, reference@saccar.sadc.int, and info@saccar.sadc.int.

<h4> SACCAR Information Management Program</h4>
<p>
Mr. Christopher Lungu is the Programs Officer for SACCAR's Information Sciences unit, and is
assisted by Mr. Jacobs Moelenyane.In addition, SACCAR funds the editor of an academic
journal.  This unit presently manages the information dissemination and exchange activities of
SACCAR, in addition to performing other support tasks for SACCAR staff.  Existing activities
include:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Publication of a quarterly full-color glossy print newsletter distributed to some 1000 free
subscribers, roughly half of whom are from the region.<p>

<li>Publication of a formal, peer-reviewed, research journal, the <b>Zimbabwe Journal of
Agricultural Research.</b><p>

<li>Distribution to libraries and affiliated researchers of free copies of books on subjects of
regional interest purchased in bulk from publishers.<p>

<li>Maintenance of a database containing some 1000 records of agricultural and natural resource
management consultants in the region.<p>

<li>Maintenance of a database containing some 500 records of SACCAR publications.<p>

<li>Operation of a database query service, providing access to CD-ROM databases from the
FAO, Agricola, and others, for the region's affiliated scientists.<p>

<li>Free dissemination of SACCAR publications and reports to interested scientists and libraries.<p>
</ol>

With improvements in its headquarters information technology infrastructure now largely
completed, SACCAR can easily make its information resources more readily and broadly
accessible.  The following activities are proposed:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Publication of the quarterly newsletter on the World Wide Web.  In place of the print
distribution for subscribers without Web access, an electronic mail or diskette Web version
can be distributed to be viewed locally with a Web browser and printed to paper.A cost
savings in printing and mailing of some $6000 per year might be realized.<p>

<li>Publication of the academic journal on the World Wide Web.  The print run might be reduced
for a cost savings, though would likely continue into the near future to stock library shelves. 
Complete elimination of the print run would result in substantial savings, however, and could
be distributed to subscribers on disk or via electronic mail, either in whole or via an abstracts
service (see below).<p>

<li>Development of a Web reference and abstracts service providing Web links of particular
regional interest.  Each week a dozen or so new links would be added on a "Hot List" page
with a hypertext link to the original.  SACCAR staff scientists would review the articles or
information resources on the Web, either identifying them for themselves or receiving them
from Mr. Lungu's office.  SACCAR staff scientists would then compose a brief abstract. 
These would then be filed on topically organized summary pages.  Printouts of the summary
pages can be distributed periodically to those without Web access, and requested articles can
be sent by electronic mail or ordinary post.  A special Internet address,
&lt;reference@saccar.org&gt;, can be created for this purpose.<p>

<li>Placement of its agriculture and natural resource management consultant database on the
World Wide Web for easier access.  It is proposed that a system comparable to that used by
USAID for its "Yellow Book" and for the online AfricaLink Registry be used.  The data are
maintained in a Microsoft Access database on a Windows NT Workstation.  A suitable
HTTPD compliant Web server, such as O'Reilly's WebSite, is installed to provide access to
Web pages for the public.  Also installed is software called Cold Fusion, which accepts Web
page forms from the public, uses them to query the database, and then creates a Web page
with the desired information to be returned via the Internet to the requesting party.  Info-
Botswana does not have this facility.  The database can therefore be placed on a SANGONet
server that is already operational, or as a last resort on the USAID server in Washington.<p>

<li>Placement of its publication list on the World Wide Web.  The procedure is the same as that
described in the preceding paragraph for the consultant database.<p>

<li>Introduction of a World Wide Web query service.  For the many network members of
SACCAR who do not have or cannot afford access to the Web, SACCAR can receive queries
and conduct Web searches, returning the retrieved information to the requesting party by
electronic mail, on disk, or in printed form.  As SACCAR's information department develops
sophisticated skills in Web searching, it can further assist even those with their own Web
access who may not know how to find the information they require.<p>

<li>Placement of the full text of important reports and documents on the World Wide Web.  This
is self-explanatory and is simple to accomplish.  A document already prepared on disk may
require perhaps 10 minutes per page to convert to a format suitable for Web publication.  The
process is thus somewhat labor intensive.  If SACCAR wishes to mass produce documents on
the Web on a regular basis, software can be obtained to ease the labor requirement. 
Publication of documents on the Web eliminates in many cases the need to post documents
by ordinary mail or DHL, since documents can be freely downloaded from the Web by
anyone wishing a printed copy.  Those without Web access can be sent a disk copy for local
Web browsing or for printing.
</ol>
<p>
These proposed activities require disk space on a World Wide Web Server.  Except for the
database functions, Info-Botswana is prepared to offer such space at a rate below that charged to
its commercial customers.  The standard commercial rate is about $100 per month for 1
megabyte or storage.  A rate with SANGONeT for use of its database server is to be negotiated.

<h4>SACCAR Training Program</h4>
<p>
It is generally recognized that some form of training is required to assure that SACCAR and its
affiliated network members are capable of fully utilizing the information technologies being
made available to them.  Discussions with SACCAR and SANGONeT centered around the
specific needs to be addressed, and the content of workshops or tutorials to meet those needs. 
Given limited funds, cost-effective solutions were explored.

<p>
The standard format of a training experience seems to be a major workshop held within the
region for a specific purpose.  Costs include airfare, lodging and per diem for all participants,
facilities rental, and salaries for all trainers and consultants.  Costs can be quite high.  For a one-
week event it is reasonable to budget $2000 for each participant plus $8000 for each international
trainer and consultant.  A one-week workshop for 30 participants and four trainers would
therefore cost perhaps as much as $100,000.

<p>
AfricaLink has requested and the RCSA has made available about $7,000 for training activities. 
Cost-effective solutions are available to make effective use of these funds.  Four types of training
events were discussed: practicums contracted through local service providers, online tutorials
(sometimes called "distance learning"), workshops for participants within a single country in
partnership with the local private sector, and regional workshop "add-ons" held in conjunction
with regional meetings already scheduled for some other purpose.

<h4> Service Provider Practicums</h4>
<p>
A key strategy of AfricaLink is to work through local service providers to effect the connection
of individual scientists and research stations to the Internet.  This strategy initially involves
complicated and tedious arrangements with dozens of individual service providers scattered
around the continent, each with their own pricing schemes and technology offerings.  The reward
for this initial difficulty is the establishment of a strong relationship between an individual
scientist and a local service provider to whom the scientist may now turn for technical support
and training.

<p>
Many service providers offer regular seminars to help their clients understand how to use their
technology more effectively.  It is in their interest to do so, since a knowledgeable customer base
calls for technical support less frequently.  Service providers are also often willing to offer
specialized trainings for groups of their clients at reduced rates.

<p>
The Southern Africa Help Desk at SANGONeT will be asked to explore with particular service
providers the kinds of local training experiences that can be made available to USAID partners in
each country.  If necessary, SANGONeT can under its contract with USAID develop materials
that can be duplicated and distributed to service providers in the region to help strengthen their
customer service capabilities.

<h4> Online Tutorials</h4>
<p>
As most SACCAR network members now have electronic mail access (see report below), it is
feasible to conduct certain kinds of trainings electronically.  These can be conducted by anyone
anywhere on the Internet, for anyone anywhere on the Internet.  Hence a professor at a land-grant
college in the United States could hold a seminar on rice production or the latest techniques in
fish farming.  An Internet service provider in Nairobi can offer a tutorial on effective Web page
design.  A USAID administrator can conduct an online workshop on the mechanics of preparing
unsolicited proposals.

<p>
For SACCAR affiliated network members, an appropriate initial topic for online tutorials is
effective communications techniques using electronic mail.  Specifically, it is proposed that
SANGONeT lead a tutorial on the effective use of electronic conference tools.  Topics to be
covered will include:

<ol>
<li>Introduction to ListServ/ListProc technology, how it works, where the messages go, etc.<br>
<li>Appropriate message styles for conferences<br>
<li>Conference etiquette<br>
<li>Conference "proceedings" (archives, document retrieval using email commands)<br>
<li>Practice in sending and receiving conference messages<br>
</ol>

<p>
For future online tutorials and electronic workshops, it is the responsibility of USAID and
SACCAR staff to propose appropriate topics.  AfricaLink and the SANGONeT Southern Africa
Help Desk can assist by helping staff understand the capabilities of the technology and by
assisting in adapting content to fit the technology.  Specific content in most cases remains the
responsibility of staff.

<a NAME="National Workshops"></a>
<h4> Locally Based Workshops in Partnership with the Private Sector</h4>
<p>
Local service providers are often willing to host seminars and workshops to help their clients
improve their electronic networking technical skills.  Adapting these seminars and workshops to
include program content is a natural extension.

<p>
The service provider has the opportunity to address an audience that will include many existing
clients but potentially many new ones, and can discuss with all of them the advantages of new
services and merchandise of use to them in their work.  At the same time, SACCAR affiliated
network leadership can offer tutorials using the service provider's equipment and electronic
network access to demonstrate how the technology can be used for specific program purposes.

<p>
How these seminars and workshops are organized will depend in each country on the interests of
the private-sector service provider, the nature of the technology available there, and the presence
of particular groups of SACCAR and other USAID partners.  If there is in country, say, 15
scientists all working on natural resource management issues, a seminar might there be organized
specifically to introduce natural resource management Internet offerings.  If on the other hand
there is no single programmatic area having a large number of local scientists, a more general
curriculum might be developed.

<p>
The SANGONeT Southern Africa Help Desk will maintain a database of USAID partners in
each country, and can use this database to determine what kinds of local workshops will be most
appropriate in each country.  AfricaLink funds from the RCSA can be used to develop
appropriate course materials.  The private sector can be approached to provide meeting facilities
and network access.

<p>
An initial pilot workshop is proposed to be held in Botswana, tentatively from May 15 to 16. 
Info-Botswana will be approached to determine if there is interest on their part.  SACCAR itself
has 12 computers in boxes that might be unpacked and used for the event.  The proposed topics
for about 30 participants are:
<ol>
<li>Info-Botswana electronic mail and Internet tools (half day)<p>
<li>Using Netscape to learn about commodity export rules in South Africa (quarter day)<p>
<li>Case Study: Using email to find out about commodity export rules in South Africa (quarter
day)<p>
<li>Practicum with unstructured but supervised access to networking 
facilities; with participants choosing from suggested tasks to undertake, 
or providing tasks of their own (half day)<p> 
<li>Presentations and discussions from existing users on the ways the Internet is used in their
work (half day)
</ol>

<p>
Key advantages of having a workshop such as this in a country for scientists and others from that
country are:
<ol>
<li>Practicums on a technology platform that is actually available to the participants<p>
<li>Establishment of a local "users group" for mutual support<p>
<li>Availability of follow-up technical support from the host service provider<p>
</ol>

<h4>Regional Workshop Add-Ons</h4>

<p>
The various SACCAR affiliated networks have already scheduled periodic meetings that bring
together network members from around the region.  Airfare, lodging, per diem, and facilities
charges are already allocated for this purpose.  A half day or additional day of information
technology workshops can easily be attached to these meetings at a modest additional cost.

<p>
Proposed for a generic half-day session suitable for a meeting of programmatic scientists are the
following topics:
<ol>
<li>Technical information about the Internet tailored to the group's needs and interests, e.g. how
the Internet works, what is the World Wide Web, or how electronic mail messages reach their
destinations (one hour).<p>

<li>Case studies on how the Internet is applied in their specific program area (two hours)<p>

<li>A bibliography of reference materials available online in their specific program area (one
hour).
</ol>

<p>
Depending on available funding and facilities, perhaps in partnership with a local Internet service
provider in the private sector or at a university, evening practicums can be scheduled.  A
computer facility would be rented with workstations at which participants can themselves
implement the searches and other techniques discussed in the day's sessions.

<p>
An initial pilot workshop of this nature is proposed for the July meetings of the Southern African
Roots Research Network (SARRNeT) to be held in Maputo from May 19 to 24.  This would
immediately follow the previous week's workshop held in Botswana.  The conjunction of the
two pilot workshops would enable the AfricaLink Advisor to participate as backstop technical
consultant, though actual implementation in each case would be carried out by SACCAR with
the assistance of SANGONeT and the local service providers.

<p>
In Maputo, Internet access is available through Eduardo Mondlane University.  Preliminary
discussions are being initiated by SACCAR with staff there to determine feasibility and costs.  A
proposal will then be prepared for the leadership of SARRNeT.

<h4>SACCAR Connectivity Program</h4>

<p>
SACCAR has made significant and substantial progress in facilitating the initial connectivity of
its affiliated network members to the Internet.  Funds from USAID previously awarded to
SACCAR were made available to support the connectivity of the following networks:

<ol>
<li>Southern African Roots Research Network (SARRNeT)<p>
<li>Sorghum/Millet Improvement Programme (SMIP)<p>
<li>Plant Genetics Research Network (Genetics)<p>

<p>
In addition, the Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC) has made
available funds to support the Southern African Agricultural Information Network (SAAINeT).

<p>
AfricaLink assistance through SACCAR may be provided for Internet service charges in some
cases to complement IDRC funding for equipment.

<p>
SACCAR maintains records of its network members and Internet connectivity assistance in a
database.  In the future, this database will be maintained by SANGONeT in behalf of SACCAR. 
Each record in the database was reviewed during this visit.  Presented here is a summary of
results by country:

<ol>

<li>Angola, 3 connected, 0 unconnected.  One check was sent to fund one email connection
serving the three individual scientists.<p>

<li>Botswana, 12 connected, 1 unconnected.  Five of those connected are staff scientists at
SACCAR.  One check was sent to the local agricultural institution, intended to create two
separate Internet sites.  The institution wishes to pool funds for several scientists to purchase
a computer and one Internet account.  That one Internet account is already operational and
serves seven people.  A single email account will be purchased for the scientist physically
based at a different location.  That account is not yet operational.<p>

<li>Lesotho, 7 connected, 0 unconnected.  Two Internet connection sites were funded by
IDRC/SACCAR.  Five scientists have access at one site, while two have access at the other.<p>

<li>Malawi, 4 connected, 7 unconnected.  All four connected individuals received assistance
from other sources.  Six unconnected individuals have not responded to SACCAR requests
for proposals.  One unconnected individual has IDRC/SACCAR funded equipment and is to
secure a proforma invoice for AfricaLink funding of an electronic mail connection.<p>

<li>Mauritius, 1 connected, 1 unconnected.  One check was sent to connect the one individual. 
The other individual did not respond to the SACCAR request for proposals.<p>

<li>Mozambique, 1 connected, 4 unconnected.  The one connected individual received support
from other sources.  There was no response from the other four.<p>

<li>Namibia, 1 connected, 5 unconnected.  A check was sent for four individuals.  One was
connected with those funds.  Internet accounts have been opened for the other three, who are
waiting for telephone installations.  Of the remaining two unconnected, one has submitted a
request for assistance through IDRC/SACCAR, while the other did not respond to the
SACCAR request for proposals.<p>

<li>South Africa, 5 connected, 1 unconnected.  All the connected individuals received assistance
from other sources.  The one unconnected individual did not respond to the request for
proposals.<p>

<li>Swaziland, 6 connected, 0 unconnected.  Funds were sent for four individuals.  These funds
were used to establish one Internet account.  Six SACCAR affiliated persons are able to use
this one account.<p>

<li>Tanzania, 3 connected, 1 unconnected.  At least one of the three connected individuals was
assisted by AfricaLink/ICRAF (an update of the ICRAF database is pending).  No assistance
from SACCAR was provided.  Of the three unconnected, one has no phone, while the other
two did not respond to the SACCAR request for proposals.<p>

<li>Zambia, 5 connected, 2 unconnected.  Funds were sent for four separate Internet installations. 
Unexpected cabling costs meant that only three sites were connected, leaving a balance of
$31 for the fourth.  SACCAR is satisfied with the accounting, and intends to add funds for
the fourth installation. The remaining two connected individuals obtained assistance from
other sources.  One unconnected individual did not respond to the request for proposals.<p>

<li>Zimbabwe, 6 connected, 0 unconnected.  A check was sent to fund four connections.  These
funds were used for two separate Internet installations.  Three individuals have access at one
site, while one has access at the other.  Two additional connected individuals were funded
from other sources.
</ol>

<p>
Mr. Lungu is in the process of reviewing expenditures to date.  Not all persons receiving
assistance have returned receipts to account for the funds spent.  Additional efforts will be made
to contact non-respondents.

<h4>Appendix: Internet Domains and Subdomains -- Significance for SACCAR</h4>

<p>
SACCAR has been advised to register an Internet subdomain &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt;.  It might also
consider registering its own domain &lt;saccar.int&gt;.  Registration generally costs $50 per year for
the domain name, but as a subdomain of &lt;sadc.int&gt; it will be up to SADC to determine if any
charge should be levied.  Normally, no charge is imposed.  UUNet in South Africa may charge a
small fee to update the SADC registration on their server to include routing to SACCAR.  Info-
Botswana may also charge a small handling fee.  These fees are generally $100 or less.

<p>
The selection of an address name for SACCAR is important because it expresses the identity of
the organization to the Internet world, and because it defines to some extent the flexibility with
which SACCAR can transfer its Internet account to another service provider in the future.  The
technical reason for this relationship between the Internet address and choice of service provider
is as follows.

<p>
The actual route by which electronic mail messages pass through the Internet to reach SACCAR
is determined by a unique number, called an Internet Protocol (IP) number.  IP numbers are four-
part numbers, such as 161.105.35.1.  Internet service providers obtain "blocks" of these numbers
from the Internet Information Center (InterNIC), which is the primary coordination body of the
Internet.  Internet service providers then allocate their numbers to particular computers.  Each
number uniquely identifies one computer.

<p>
IP numbers are difficult for people to remember, but easy for computers to process.  Domain
names (i.e. &lt;sadc.int&gt;) were created because they are easy for people to remember.  Each domain
name is associated with an IP number in a worldwide registry that is also coordinated by the
InterNIC, but also by the primary domain name holder in each country (e.g. &lt;.bw&gt; for Botswana
held by Botswana Telecommmunications Corporation).  When an Internet address (containing a
domain name) is typed into an electronic mail message, the computer consults a "domain name
server" or DNS to determine the IP number associated with the domain-name address. 
Computers use the number, not the domain name, to route mail.

<p>
It is proposed that SACCAR obtain a subdomain &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt;.  Only the domain name
&lt;sadc.int&gt; generally appears in the international domain registry, but all computers will
understand that mail for &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt; must be routed to whichever computer is associated
with &lt;sadc.int&gt;.  That computer, presently located at UUNet in South Africa, will then know to
route mail to Info-Botswana for SACCAR.

<p>
As SACCAR does not have its own IP address (which implies a dedicated TCP/IP system with
leased telephone lines), it can arrange for its Internet service provider to host its subdomain
name.  Thus &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt; will be associated with an IP number "owned" by Info-Botswana. 
Once registered, all domain-name servers in the world will know that mail addressed to this IP
number should be routed via UUNet in South Africa to an Info-Botswana computer.  It may also
be possible to register the &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt; subdomain directly in the domain registry, so that
mail can be routed directly without first passing by UUNet.

<p>
If at some future time SACCAR should find a need to transfer its business to a different Internet
service provider, it can arrange for that new provider to host its subdomain name.  In other
words, SACCAR can "house" its &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt; address with any service provider in the
world, and can move that address to a new service provider without changing the wording of its
address.  Upon re-registration, the underlying IP number will change in the worldwide domain-
name registry, but the &lt;saccar.sadc.int&gt; address will remain constant.  There will be no need to
change business cards or official letterhead.  There will be no need to advise all SACCAR
contacts of any change of address.
