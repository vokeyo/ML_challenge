	<b>Accomplishments</b>: Morohological and meristic measurements, and genetic analyses on fathead minnows, pearl dace, and blacknose shinners have been completed and this Task will end in FY06 upon completion of a final report to Isle Royale and Voyageurs National Parks (see products field).<br><b>Communication Plan</b>: Data and information from this research will be transferred to the resource management and scientific community through a final report to the National Park Service and a peer-reviewed journal publication.<br><b>Objectives</b>: The primary Fisheries and Aquatic Resources program goals are: (1)Diversity, Species Interactions and Life History - to investigate aquatic species diversity; (2)Restoration Science - to provide science for restoring and maintaining declining species and their required habitat; and (4)Aquatic Species and habitats - to understand relationships between and among aquatic species and habitats.

Objective: to compare the morphological and genetic characteristics of Cyprinid species from Isle Royale and Voyageurs National Parks with fish from other localities within the species range in Minnesota. <br><b>Statement of Problem</b>: On the basis of morphological measurements, previous investigators concluded that three cyprinid species, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), blacknose shiner (Notropis heterolepis), and pearl dace (Margariscus margarita), from Harvey Lake in Isle Royale National Park were unique enough to warrant subspecific status. Other investigators, however, have questioned these designations and concluded the Harvey Lake fish do not merit such designation. Infomation on the genetic profiles of these three cyprinid species is needed to clarify whether they are in fact unique and should be considered as subspecies. <br><b>2003 Statement of Work</b>: All field collections for this study were completed in 1995-96 and data on morphological characteristics were collected during 1998 and 1999. During FY03, we will continue the genetic analyses, which were initiated in 1998. <br><b>2004 Progress</b>: During FY04 we continued to collaborate with geneticists to finalize the work within this task.  <br><b>2004 Statement of Work</b>: In FY 2004, due to funding and staff limitations the genetic and morphological data analyses will be continued on a limited basis.<br><b>2005 Progress</b>: In FY05 analysis of genetic and morphology data on the cyprinid species was completed and the preparation a a final report was initiated.<br><b>2005 Statement of Work</b>: In FY05, the genetic and morphological data analyses will be completed. Preparation of a final report will be initiated.<br><b>2006 Progress</b>: Completion of this project has been delayed.  Efforts are being continued to complete the analyses on the morphological and genetic characteristics collected for Cyprinids in Isle Royale and Voyageurs National Park.<br><b>2006 Statement of Work</b>: In FY06, a final report on the genetic and morphological characteristics of cyprinid species will be completed and submitted to Isle Royale National Park.<br><b>2007 Statement of Work</b>: In FY07, existing data from the genetic portion of the study will be obtained from the collaborating scientist, and work will be initiated on the final report on the genetic and morphological characteristics of cyprinid species from Isle Royale National Park.<br>
