<h1 align="left"><b>How you can evaluate 
what the proposed Census Bureau criteria on Urbanized Areas means for your area.</b></h1>
<p>This paper explains how 
to construct urban clusters and estimate urbanized areas using the proposed 
definition of the Census Bureau (posted at <a href="http://wwwcf.fhwa.dot.gov/exit.cfm?link=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/ua/ua_2k.html">www.census.gov/geo/www/ua/ua_2k.html</a>) 
For explanation purposes, we used Danville, IL as an example. </p>
<p>First, please read the 
Federal Register notice.&#160; Second, you will need a GIS to read in TIGER/Line 
files and Census 2000 population counts using the PL-94-171 data for the areas 
you are interested in examining. For guidance on how to obtain these files, 
please read a note posted at <a href="http://wwwcf.fhwa.dot.gov/exit.cfm?link=http://www.mcs.net/%7Eberwyned/census/products/pl2gis.html">http://www.mcs.net/~berwyned/census/products/pl2gis.html</a>.</p>
<p>In our example, we used 
Arcview 3.2 as our tool.&#160; You will need to know how to use your GIS to 
complete this process.&#160; </p>
<p>Population density by block 
group (BG) and block is the key factor in the selection of areas to be included 
in the Urbanized area.&#160; Place (or city) boundaries are not used.&#160; 
A summary of the process is shown on page 2.&#160; </p>
<p><b>I. Add Data to GIS:</b></p>
<p>We created four layers 
of information:</p>
<p>1. A layer containing 2000 
population counts by block.&#160; The attribute table for the layer contained 
the following attributes derived from the redistricting (PL-94-171) files:</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Land area of the block 
as identified in the &quot;Arealand&quot; field of the geography file from PL-94-171. 
The &quot;Arealand&quot; field contains land area of the block group in square meters. 
Land Area was converted to square miles using the conversion factor 0.3861 
x 10<sup>-6 </sup>square meters = 1 square mile.</li>
<li>Tract, Block group, 
and block fields from the geographic header file.</li>
<li>Total population counts 
from the data files.</li>
<li>Population density of 
the block (Total population divided by land area in square miles)</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Transportation (roads) 
layer from TIGER/Line 2000, and </p>
<p>3. A polygon layer containing 
the water polygons from TIGER/Line 2000.</p>
<p>4. A polygon layer containing 
National Parks, Monuments, and Military installations.</p>
<p><b>II.&#160; Create Block 
Group Layer</b> </p>
<p>The final step in the data 
set creation process is to aggregate the block data into block group data.&#160; 
Using the block data (in layer 1 above), we created a layer aggregating information 
from blocks to block groups.&#160; The attribute table for the BG layer contained 
total population, area in square miles, and population density (total population 
/ area in sqmiles) of the block group.<br>

<p><b>Step 1: Examine high-density 
block groups</b></p>
<p>From the Block Group layer, 
find all the Block Groups (BGs) that have an area &lt; 2 square miles, and contain 
a population density &gt; &#160;1000 people per square mile (ppsm).&#160; One 
or more of these BGs constitute a &quot;core&quot; of densely populated area that will 
be further built upon in the later steps.&#160; If there is no BG core in your 
area, you can use blocks with population density &gt; &#160;1000 people per 
square mile (ppsm) as the starting point.</p>

BGs for Danville, Ill</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Find all BGs with area 
&lt; 2 square miles, population density is between 500 ppsm and 1000 ppsm.&#160; 
Figure 2 illustrates these BGs for Danville, Ill.&#160; There are 4 eligible 
BGs for the Danville area.&#160; These are numbered 1 through 4 in the figure.&#160; 
However, only BGs 1,2, and 3 are immediately adjacent to the &quot;core&quot; selected 
in Step 1.&#160; BG 4 is not adjacent to the densely populated area.&#160; Thus, 
using criteria I.A.3, only 1,2, and 3 can be combined to the area obtained from 
step 1.&#160; <br>

BGs 1,2,and 3 are BGs contiguous to the core. BG 4 is not contiguous to the 
&quot;core&quot; obtained from Step 1.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b>:&#160; Find 
all blocks with population density &gt; &#160;&#160;500 ppsm. The eligible blocks 
are shown in figure 3, along with the &quot;core&quot; obtained in step 2.</p>

<p>Select only those eligible 
blocks that are connected to the core either directly or via other blocks, and 
include them in the &quot;core&quot;.&#160; </p>
<p><b>Step 4: Using the &quot;hop&quot; 
criteria.</b></p>
<p>Find all the blocks/densely 
populated areas within 0.5 miles of the &quot;core&quot; obtained in step 4.&#160; Distance 
should be measured along the shortest road connection.</p>
<p>There are two conditions 
where you can &quot;hop&quot; and connect to eligible block(s) or other unconnected densely 
populated areas (BG cores + blocks) not contiguous to the &quot;core&quot;.</p>
<p><b>Case A:</b> When the 
unconnected densely populated area has more than 1000 people</p>
<p>In this case add the area 
to the core, along with other &quot;connecting&quot; blocks such that the density is the 
greatest along the shortest road path (See figure 4).</p>

<p align="center">Figure 4: 
Illustration for case A.</p>
<p>In Figure 4, Area A is 
an unconnected densely populated area with a population of 2400.&#160; In this 
case, select the blocks with the highest density along the shortest path to 
connect area A to the core.</p>
<p><b>Case B:</b> When the 
unconnected densely populated area has less than 1000 people</p>
<p>In this case, connecting 
blocks are selected along the shortest possible road connection such that the 
combined density of the unconnected area and the connecting blocks is greater 
than 500 ppsm (See figure 5)</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" width="535" height="357" src="census5.gif" alt="Figure 5: Illustration for Case B"> </p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 5: 
Illustration for case B.</p>
<p>In Figure 5, Case B, Area 
B is an unconnected densely populated area with population of 653 people.&#160; 
In this case, calculate the overall density of the area B and the blocks i,ii, 
and iii.&#160; If the density of Area B plus blocks i,ii, and iii &gt; 500 ppsm, 
then they can be added to the core.</p>
<p>Once an area becomes part 
of the core, additional &quot;hops&quot; from that area can be performed using the same 
rules.</p>
<p>At the end of step 4, all 
connections using &quot;hops&quot; between dense areas must be completed.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Step A: Closing 
areas enclosed by the &quot;core&quot;</b></p>

donuts in the area obtained in step 4.&#160;&#160;&#160; Figure 6 illustrates

<p align="left"><b>Step 6: 
Using the &quot;Jump&quot; Criteria.</b></p>
<p align="left">The &quot;jump&quot; 
criteria are the same as the hop criteria, except that the distance between 
the core and the other densely populated area can be 2.5 miles.&#160; </p>
<p align="left">Figure 8 illustrates 
two possible jumps for the Danville area.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" width="514" height="365" src="census8.gif" alt="Figure 8:  Jump criteria illustrated for the Danville area."> </p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 8: 
&quot;Jump&quot; criteria illustrated for the Danville area.</p>
<p align="left">For the Danville 
area, Satellite cores 1 and 2 qualify to be added to the &quot;main core&quot; 
because their distances from the core is less than 2.5 miles, and their populations 
exceed 1000 people.&#160; However satellite core 3 does not qualify, because 
only one &quot;Jump&quot; is allowed.&#160; The method used to select connecting 
blocks to the core is the same as that for the hop criteria as explained in 
Step 4.</p>
<p align="left">&#160;&quot;Jumps&quot; 
of up to 5 miles are allowed in special cases, when there is a water body, National 
Monument, National Park, or Military installation; which creates a gap between 
the densely populated areas.&#160; </p>
<p align="left">Wetlands and 
other land areas that may be uninhabitable cannot be used for the 5 mile jump 
criteria because TIGER/Line file does not distinguish these areas from developable 
land.</p>
<p align="left">One of the 
examples we found is Brunswick, GA.&#160; Examining the Brunswick, GA area using 
2000 data, it appears that the distance between the Brunswick core and the densely 
populated St. Simons Island area is 3.15 miles (3.8 miles - .65 miles of water). 
Thus, under the proposed criteria the two areas would not be joined for the 
urbanized area.&#160; This is illustrated in figure 9.</p>
