<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>[<B>133</B>] One of the beauties of astronomy is that you do not
have to be an expert to enjoy it. Anyone can step outside on a clear
moonless night, gaze at thousands of stars shining across the vast
interstellar spaces, and become intoxicated by a heady mix of
grandeur and existential chill. The same questions come to mind time
and again: How far away are the stars? How many are there? Are they
strewn endlessly through space, or are we part of an island universe
of suns that ends abruptly somewhere out there in the black ocean of
space? It has been the sometimes heroic and often frustrating task of
astronomers since the dawn of science to chart our position in the
cosmic ocean. In the twentieth century, significant progress has been
made in constructing an accurate map of the cosmos.</P>

<P>We know, for example, that our solar system is part of a much
larger system of hundreds of billions of stars. This system is the
Milky Way Galaxy, a huge disk of stars and gas. We also know that
ours is not the only galaxy in the universe. As far as the largest
telescopes in the world can see, there are galaxies in every
direction. The nearest galaxies to our own are the Magellanic Clouds,
the "crown jewels of the southern skies," to use Bart Bok's
description. The Magellanic Clouds are small irregular galaxies, a
catch-all term for those somewhat shapeless galaxies that do not fit
neatly into a spiral or elliptical category. The Large Cloud is about
160000 light years from the solar system and has a mass about
one-tenth that of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Small Cloud is about
200000 light years away; it has a mass about one-thirtieth that of
the Large Cloud. Because they are so near, they are an invaluable
laboratory for astronomers to study the evolution of stars and
galaxies. The nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way Galaxy is the
Andromeda Galaxy, at a distance of about 2 million light years. It is
a giant spiral galaxy, much like our own in size, shape, numbers of
stars, and types of stars. This nearby sister galaxy provides us with
an opportunity to get a bird's eye view of a galaxy much like our
own, to, in effect, "see ourselves as others do."</P>

<P>Just as stars are bound together by their gravitational forces to
form galaxies, so also do galaxies come together to form groups or
clusters. Our galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy, together with at least
19 smaller galaxies, form a complex called the Local Group. The
Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way Galaxy are at opposite ends of the
group. The smaller galaxies are clustered around the larger ones, but
on the whole, there is a lot of empty space in the group, and the
chance of the large galaxies ever colliding is remote.</P>

<P>[<B>134</B>] As we look beyond the Local Group to distances of a
few tens of millions of light years, we find other similar groups of
galaxies. At a distance of about 60 million light years, in the Virgo
constellation, we encounter the Virgo cluster of galaxies. The Virgo
cluster is a system of several thousand galaxies. Most of these
galaxies are large spirals and smaller, elliptically shaped galaxies.
In addition, it contains a few giant, spherical galaxies. About 10
percent of all the galaxies in the universe are in rich clusters such
as Virgo. One especially rich cluster is located in the constellation
Coma Berenices. Called the Coma cluster of galaxies, it is almost
directly overhead in the springtime sky, about 400 million light
years away.</P>

<P>In the Coma cluster, 1000 galaxies are packed into a space roughly
the size of the Local Group, which contains only about 20 galaxies.
The crowded conditions in the Coma cluster and other rich clusters of
galaxies have undoubtedly played a dominant role in the evolution of
the individual galaxies and the cluster as a whole. X-ray
observations have revealed that the space between the galaxies in
rich clusters is filled with hot gas. As the galaxies move through
this gas, they are stripped of gas and dust, adding to the supply of
cluster gas. At the same time, this process deprives the galaxies of
the raw material from which to form new stars. In a sense, then,
galaxies age more quickly in the congested environment of rich
clusters, because new generations of stars cannot form.</P>

<P>The galaxies in clusters show other peculiarities. An example is
the giant elliptical galaxy known as M87. This remarkable galaxy is
located in the center of the Virgo cluster. It is about three times
more luminous than our galaxy and is estimated to contain as many as
a trillion stars. Emanating from the nucleus, or central region of
M87, is a peculiar jet-like feature. This jet is a strong source of
radio, optical, and X-ray emission. Evidently, the jet was ejected
from the nucleus of M87 a million or so years ago in a violent
explosion that may still be occurring today.</P>

<P>In the last 20 years, evidence of explosive activity has been
found to be a common feature of many elliptical galaxies and other
peculiar objects most notably quasars. In fact, virtually every
galactic nucleus is the site of explosive activity at some level. In
quasars, these explosions are awesome. An energy output exceeding
that of 10 trillion suns is produced in a region approximately the
size of our solar system! It is as if a power source the size of a
small flashlight could produce as much light as all the lights in
metropolitan Los Angeles.</P>

<P>What is the source of the violent activity in the galactic nuclei
and quasars? Many intriguing ideas - multiple supernova explosions,
supermassive stars, huge spinning magnetized disks of gas - have been
suggested, but the one that is being taken most seriously nowadays
involves black holes having the mass of hundreds of millions of suns.
The basic idea is the same as that discussed in the previous chapter.
As matter falls toward a black hole, it gains a tremendous amount of
energy. If only a small fraction [<B>135</B>] of this energy, say 10
percent, is radiated away before the matter falls into the black
hole, and if there is a steady supply of infalling matter, then a
large amount of energy can be radiated from a very small region of
space. For the most powerful quasars, roughly one solar mass of
material would have to fall into the black hole every year. In this
picture, a quasar is a more or less ordinary galaxy with an
extraordinarily active black hole in its nucleus.</P>

<P>Because of their high luminosity, quasars can be seen at great
distances - 10 billion light years or more. That is, the light, radio
waves, and X-rays we now see from the most distant quasars left those
objects more than 10 billion years ago. That is about the time that
most astronomers believe the galaxies were forming. The observations
indicate that quasars were considerably more numerous then. This
raises the suspicion that the quasar phenomenon may be intimately
related to the process of galaxy formation. In any event, quasars are
proving to be extremely valuable beacons with which to illuminate the
frontiers of the cosmic ocean. The questions raised by the
observations of clusters of galaxies and the explosive galactic
nuclei are at the frontier of modern astrophysical research on the
structure and evolution of galaxies and the universe. Observations
made in the high energy band of the spectrum, especially those made
with the sophisticated HEAO instruments, have played and are still
playing a vital role in pushing back this frontier and enlarging our
perspective of the universe in which we live. In the next few
chapters, I touch on some of the results from the HEAO experiments
and how they relate to some of the outstanding cosmologic questions
of the day: How do galaxies evolve, both inside and outside of rich
clusters of galaxies? What is the nature of the hidden mass that
holds clusters of galaxies together? What causes the explosive
activity in galactic nuclei and quasars? Is there matter between the
clusters of galaxies? Is the universe finite or infinite?</P>
