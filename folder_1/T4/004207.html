<H1>Future Areas of Development at NASA Langley</H1></CENTER>
<h2>PATRAN to RadCAD</h2>
There is no current capability with Patran to accomplish orbital analysis.
The link from PATRAN to TRASYS, as it currently exists in the commercial
package, is not usable for most programs. (TRASYS is a heritage software
package sometimes used by NASA  for orbital flux analysis.) It would be useful 
to have direct translation of a model from Patran to RadCAD available, so that orbital analysis directly on a model created in Patran from Pro/Engineer geometry could be accomplished.  It is hoped that at some time in the future this link can be achieved.
<h2>PATRAN back to SHABP</h2>
Another improvement underway is to implement the capability to export
the deflected shape of a hypersonic or supersonic body from PATRAN/NASTRAN back
to SHABP, so that the heat loads and pressure loading can be determined
for the deflected shape.&nbsp; The current experts at LaRC will develop
this improvement as time permits.

<h2>Thermal Desktop links</h2>
NASA Langley has an active interest in increasing the links available through Thermal Desktop, since Thermal Desktop is one of the most widely used thermal code within the Agency.  Some on-going efforts are to: 
<ul>
<li> Increase the geometry import capability
<li> Improve the import of aeroheating data from external aero codes such as SHABP, MINIVER, ATAC3D, etc.
<li> Create a tie to CMA, to allow fully-linked ablation modeling.
</ul>

<h2>ORCAD to Pro/ECAD to PATRAN</h2>
A link that
is only now beginning to be implemented here 
is the link from OrCAD for electronic hardware.&nbsp; This link is functional
as it stands, but there are tips and tricks for making that link work effectively,
and providing an accurate analysis of the translated part in PATRAN.&nbsp;
See <a href="Pro_ECAD_suggestions.html">suggestions for use of ORCAD file 
imported through Pro/ECAD</a>

<h2>Tool integration via 
<a href="http://step.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">STEP</a></h2>
The current tools are all set up to integrate easily with each other.&nbsp;
Some links exist for translation to other tool sets such as CATIA, IDEAS
and Unigraphics.&nbsp; Each of these other integration links has been utilized
here at Langley, but not in a production sense.&nbsp; The current status
of integration with any other tool package is on a case-by-case basis;
there is not a fully documented process that will work for all integration
needs.

It is hoped that the 
<a href="http://step.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">STEP</a> process, 
which is currently in work by a
combined team of US industry, government, and international participants,
will eventually satisfy this need.&nbsp; STEP (ISO 10303) is an International 
Standard for the computer-interpretable representation
and exchange of product data. The objective is to provide a mechanism that 
is capable of
describing product data throughout the life cycle of a product, independent 
from any particular
system. The nature of this description makes it suitable not only for neutral 
file exchange, but
also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving. 
<p>
STEP  comes out of <a href="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/disclaimer.cgi?http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=54110" target="_blank">
ISO  Technical  Committee  184 (external link)</a>, which has the
title "Industrial  automation  systems and  integration".

The  goal of STEP  is the  representation  of all  data  about  a
product  in a  computer-sensible  format.  The STEP  standard  is
formulated in a computer-parsable  information  modeling language
called "EXPRESS".

These EXPRESS information models (called "Application  Protocols"
or AP's) can be thought of as defining sets of container  objects
to put data into.  AP's define  containers for product data, such
as CAD models, CAE models, and PDM data.

<p>
The STEP file format would basically do for the design and analysis community what
IGES attempted to do for the design community. STEP is a standard 
that allows
all the geometric information about a part or assembly, and potentially analysis
information and boundary conditions such as materials, orbit parameters,
loads, temperatures, etc., to be captured in a standard format If
all the software packages then implement that standard (in the same way
that the major packages such as Pro/Engineer and PATRAN have implemented
both IGES and STEP), 
then no additional links or translators would be required.&nbsp;
Each package would incorporate a translator to and from STEP, and integration
with other tool packages would be accomplished via the STEP translator.&nbsp;

<h2>Web Documentation</h2>
Many of the translators that require knowledge beyond the associated
commercial package have been documented on Web pages.&nbsp; 
In order to broadcast information to as broad a customer base as possible,
the Langley methods for implementing links are normally documented on the
Web.
