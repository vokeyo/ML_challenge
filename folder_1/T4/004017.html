                                <p>(JAMAICA, NY)&ndash;Congressman Gregory W. Meeks welcomes the City Council&rsquo;s Land Use Committee&rsquo;s approval of a plan to rezone downtown Jamaica which lies within the congressional district he represents in the U.S. House of Representatives.&nbsp; The rezoning plan would dramatically transform downtown Jamaica into an &ldquo;airport village&rdquo; encompassing hotels, office space, and retail establishments while preserving the one- and two-family character of the neighborhoods surrounding Jamaica&rsquo;s major commercial thoroughfares.&nbsp; Calling the Land Use Committee&rsquo;s approval &ldquo;a huge step forward,&rdquo; Congressman Meeks continued:</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;With the full Council scheduled to take up the matter in early September, I am hopeful that in short order actual work can begin to bring commercial activity, jobs, new housing, expanded and modernized infrastructure, and a remaking of a 368 block area of Jamaica that is consistent with community hopes, aspirations, and values. </p>
                                <p>&ldquo;I look forward to the inclusion of local entrepreneurs, minority-owned business, and community organizations in every phase of the redevelopment of downtown Jamaica so that the people of Jamaica will also benefit not only from the commercial services and new housing, but also by obtaining many of the thousands of permanent jobs this project will create.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;Once the full Council approves the rezoning plan, we will be able to bring to life a vision of a revitalized Jamaica that so many people have worked so hard and so long toward, going back several decades.&nbsp; My predecessor, Rev. Floyd H. Flake, was deeply committed to the redevelopment of downtown Jamaica.&nbsp; Carlisle Towery, president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, devoted years of effort to this project.&nbsp; I embraced this challenge and from the moment I took the oath of office devoted considerable energy to collaborating with others to bring it to life.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;From the beginning, the Bloomberg Administration, particularly the mayor and deputy mayor for economic development, Dan Doctoroff, rolled up their sleeves and worked with us.&nbsp; As the plan that will go before the full Council demonstrates, the Administration had the foresight to take the community&rsquo;s views and concerns into account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Area civic leaders, clergy, and neighborhood advocates have been firm every step of the way by insisting that this grand project benefit the community. Yet they also displayed the flexibility required to keep the process moving forward.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;Numerous leaders from the business community and from government entities like the Port Authority played indispensable roles in helping to shape this visionary proposal.&nbsp; Their willingness to invest in the Jamaica community, to partner with the community, to be inclusive, and to commit resources and talent to link downtown Jamaica to JFK and through JFK to the global economy, has been essential.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;I especially want to acknowledge the leadership of Council Member Leroy Comrie who without fanfare but with incredible due diligence skillfully navigated the &ldquo;airport village&rdquo; rezoning plan through the City Council&rsquo;s legislative process.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;I am looking forward to working with all of the individuals, entities, and institutions who have been involved and who will be involved in redeveloping downtown Jamaica into an airport village that connects this community with the world.&rdquo;</p>
