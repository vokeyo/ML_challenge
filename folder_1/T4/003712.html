ACTION:  Final rule; request for comments<br>
<br>
SUMMARY:  This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 series airplanes.  This action requires a one-time inspection of the three DC generators to ensure that the extra unconnected bare copper wire is properly stowed.  This amendment is prompted by reports indicating that unconnected bare copper wire, which was fitted inside of some DC generators installed on these airplanes, could cause a short circuit.  The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a fire hazard that would be posed if a short circuit were to occur at this area in the presence of a combustible fuel-air mixture.<br>
<br>
DATES:  Effective December 5, 1996.<br>
	The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 5, 1996.<br>
	Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before January 21, 1997.<br>
<br>
ADDRESSES:  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103, Attention:  Rules Docket No. 96-NM-82-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.<br>
	The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Bombardier, Inc., Canadair Aerospace Group, P.O. Box 6087, Station Centre-ville, Quebec H3C 3G9, Canada.  This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, New York Aircraft Certification Office, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 10 Fifth Street, Third Floor, Valley Stream, New York; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.<br>
<br>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Wing Chan, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANE-172, FAA, New York Aircraft Certification Office, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 10 Fifth Street, Third Floor, Valley Stream, New York 11581; telephone (516) 256-7511; fax (516) 568-2716.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </b> Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 series airplanes.  Transport Canada Aviation advises that it has received reports that extra unconnected bare copper wire was fitted inside some DC generators [having part number (P/N) 2CM70D( )] that were installed on these airplanes.  The bare copper wire could cause a short circuit and, if a combustible fuel-air mixture is present at this location, it could present a fire hazard.<br>
<br>
<b>Explanation of Relevant Service Information</b><br>
	Canadair has issued Service Bulletin 215-414, dated January 4, 1989, which describes procedures for performing a one-time visual inspection of the three DC generators (ENG 1, ENG 2, and GPU2) to ensure that the extra unconnected bare copper wire (if fitted from inside of the generator) is properly and safely stowed.  The service bulletin also contains procedures for properly insulating and stowing the wire.  Transport Canada Aviation classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian airworthiness directive CF-89-05, dated July 15, 1989, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.<br>
<br>
<b>FAA's Conclusions</b><br>
	This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.19) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.  Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above.  The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.<br>
<br>
<b>Explanation of Requirements of the Rule</b><br>
	Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent a fire hazard that would be created if a short circuit, associated with the extra unconnected bare copper wire fitted in the DC generators, were to occur in the presence of a combustible fuel-air mixture.  This AD requires a one-time visual inspection to ensure that the bare copper wire fitted in the DC generators is properly insulated and stowed.  The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.<br>
<br>
<b>Cost Impact</b><br>
	None of the Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 series airplanes affected by this action are on the U.S. Register.  All airplanes included in the applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry; therefore, they are not directly affected by this AD action.  However, the FAA considers that this rule is necessary to ensure that the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes are imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future.<br>
<br>
	Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately 4 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $60 per work hour.  Based on these figures, the cost impact of this AD would be $240 per airplane.<br>
<br>
<b>Determination of Rule's Effective Date</b><br>
	Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic impact and imposes no additional burden on any person.  Therefore, prior notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the <b>Federal Register</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>Comments Invited</b><br>
	Although this action is in the form of a final rule and was not preceded by notice and opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule.  Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire.  Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption &quot;ADDRESSES.&quot;  All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received.  Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed.<br>
<br>
	Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule.  All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons.  A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.<br>
<br>
	Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made:  &quot;Comments to Docket Number 96-NM-82-AD.&quot;  The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.<br>
<br>
<b>Regulatory Impact</b><br>
	The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<br>
<br>
	For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a &quot;significant regulatory action&quot; under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a &quot;significant rule&quot; under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.  A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption &quot;ADDRESSES.&quot;<br>
