<p>This typical section will draw <b>existing</b> and <b>proposed right of way</b> 
  locations as well as <b>easements</b> utilizing plan view elements in the <b>Right 
  of Way DGN drawing</b>. The following types of right of way locations will be 
  searched for and drawn if located:</p>
<ul>  
<li><b>Existing Right of Way</b> 
<li><b>Construction Easement</b>
<li><b>Permanent Easement</b>
<li><b>Existing Property Line</b>

<p>This typical will handle multiple instances of the above listed right of way 
  types. <br>

<p><font size="5"><b>Setup the Proposed Cross Section Run:</b></font></p>
<p>Open your Cross Section DGN file that contains your existing ground elements. 
  Invoke Project Manager, as explained under <a href="proj_man.htm">Setup Project 
  Manager</a>. Put a <b>check mark</b> in the white box for <b>Working Alignment 
  Influence Runs</b> as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Click on the <b>Proposed Cross Sections</b> button as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The <b>Select Run</b> dialog appears. Create a &quot;Run&quot; by using the 
  pulldowns <b>Run</b> &gt; <b>New</b>.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">NOTE: The &quot;Run&quot; will serve the same purpose 
  as the old Proposed Cross Section Input File. Multiple &quot;Runs&quot; can 
  be created the same as multiple proposed cross section input file could be created 
  in the past.</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea3.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>New Run Name</b> dialog appears. Key in the name of the run. An optional

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea5.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>Proposed Cross Sections</b> dialog appears. Notice that the name of 
  the Run (in this case <b>Run_1</b>) also appears at the top of the dialog as 
  shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea6.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>XS DGN File</b> and browse to the cross section DGN file. Adjust 
  the <b>Tolerance</b> setting as described below:</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE: The &quot;Tolerance&quot; setting is very important. 
  For Metric projects, set this to 0.003. For US Customary projects, set the tolerance 
  to 0.01.</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea7.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Pattern</b> and put a <b>check</b> in the white box for <b>Use 
  Working Alignment</b>. Since your pattern lines have been previously defined 
  in your working alignment &quot;<b>one</b>&quot;, there is no need to identify 
  them again.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea8.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Existing Ground</b> and put a <b>check</b> in the white box for 
  <b>Use Working Alignment</b>. Since your Existing Ground has been previously 
  defined in your working alignment &quot;<b>one</b>&quot;, there is no need to 
  identify it again.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea9.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Shapes</b>. This Typical Section does not require superelevation 
  shapes, set the option toggle to <b>Shapeless</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea10.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Shape Clusters</b>. Initially the dialog appears as shown below, 
  basically blank with many of the option buttons ghosted out:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea11.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on the <b>Select</b> button and select the <b>Chain</b> as shown below. 
  Click on <b>Apply</b>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><img src="ex_fea12.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toggle the <b>Select</b> option to <b>Profile</b> and select the <b>Profile</b>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea13.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on the <b>Add</b> button as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea14.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the <b>Add</b> button is pressed the shape cluster information gets added 
  to the collection window. <b>Highlight</b> the information in the collection 
  window. The <b>Typical</b> button becomes unghosted. Click on the <b>Typical</b> 
  button as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea15.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>Typical Sections</b> dialog appears as shown below. Select the desired 
  Typical Section. Note the <b>Description</b> button located on the right side 
  of the dialog. When pressed, this invokes an on-line help file that provides 
  detailed information on how the typical works including detailed drawings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style1 style1">NOTE: For an explanation of both methods for accessing Help for Typical sections, click <a href="prxs_help.htm">here</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this example we are using <b>Right of Way</b>, so select <b>ROW</b>.</p>
<p>You may apply this Typical Section to the <b>Whole Chain</b> or a <b>Station 
  Range</b>. When <b>Apply to Station Range</b> is selected, be sure to include 
  the region numbers, as shown below (<b>r 1</b>).</p>
<p>Do <b>not</b> check the white &quot;<b>On</b>&quot; Chain box. Chances are 
  you will never use this option.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_row16.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When all options are selected and complete, click on <b>Apply</b> at the bottom 
  of the dialog.</p>
<p>Each Typical Section is associated with different combinations of criteria 
  files. When <b>Apply</b> is pressed, the user is basically instructing the software 
  what criteria files to use (and where) and populates the Proposed Cross Sections 
  dialog as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_row17.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Define DGN Variables</b>. You can ignore this portion of the <b>Proposed 
  Cross Sections</b> dialog as it <b>only applies to the Automated Cross Section 
  Labeling Typical</b>. This variable &quot;LINES TO LABEL&quot; is an &quot;exposed 
  redefinable variable&quot; and is &quot;exposed&quot; so that when you do run 
  the Automated Cross Section Labeling Typical you have the option to select or 
  deselect proposed cross section element symbology to fit your situation. </p>
<p>When using the <b>.x21 criteria files</b>, this dialog is now blank<b>, since 
  there is nothing to populate these fields, with this Typical.</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="ex_fea18.gif"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Click on <b>Define Variables</b>. This portion of the dialog is where you specify 
  &quot;Global&quot; variables such as the name of your mapping file where all 
  the existing features are drawn (existing fence, existing edge of pavement.......). 
  You must also specify the names of all other DGN files where the software is 
  supposed to look for plan view elements, such as proposed widening lines, or 
  proposed guardrail.</p>
<p><font size="4">To change/modify a default value:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Highlight</b> the Variable, (such as <b>EXISTING TOPO DGN</b>), by clicking 
    in the white area.</li>
  <li>Once highlighted, the default value will populate the <b>Value</b> field.</li>
  <li>Key-in the Value and press <b>Modify</b>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><img src="ex_row19.gif"></p>

<p>When all modifications are completed, save the Run settings using the pulldown 
  <b>Files</b> &gt; <b>Save Settings</b> as shown below:</p>
