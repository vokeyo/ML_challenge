1.2 Description                                                
    1.2.1 Abstract:
            Land over/land use databases were developed from 1991 color infrared aerial photography for pools within the Upper Mississippi River System.  Photos were interpreted, and line work was transferred to mylar overlays registered to USGS 7.5' quadrangle enlargements at a scale of 1:15,000 before being manually digitized.
    1.2.2 Purpose:
            To produce a detailed map of terresterial and aquatic land cover and land use of the Upper Mississippi River floodplain for trend analysis.
    1.2.3 Supplemental Information:
            Aerial photography was collected for the entire Upper Mississippi River in 1991 and several pools have been similarily mapped with a goal of creating a systemic database of land cover/use.

    2.5.3.1 Process Description:
            Scale of photography was 1:15,000. Photo interpretation was performed with a Bausch and Lomb 240 zoom stereoscope at 6X magnification using 4x0 drafting pens on clear acetate overlays registered to photo transparencies.  The minimum mapping unit was 1 acre(approximately 4000 mý).  Extensive ground truthing was performed along with the interpretation. Data were transferred from photo overlays to mylar overlays registered to USGS 7.5'  quadrangle enlargements at a scale of 1:15,000, using a Bausch & Lomb zoom transfer scope.  All data were transferred and were digitized into ARC/INFO on Altek digitizing tables (absolute accuracy 0.001 inch up to +/- 0.003 inch).  No data reduction or generalization intransferring or digitizing took place.

    5.2.1 Entity and Attribute Overview:
            The different attributes represent the data in a generalized and specific manner.  The most specific attributes describe the vegetation to the genus level of classification. The specific genus levels have also been categorized into 13 general vegetation classes.  The attributes contain numerical codes and descriptors. Modifiers exist which represent percent of vegetation cover and tree height.
