  <b>A Study of Ditching</b><br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

  The Army and Navy requested the NACA to investigate

  the behavior of military air planes while ditching in order to obtain information

  that would help reduce the loss of personnel in that operation. The only feasible method

  appeared to be the ditching of dynamically similar scale models of the airplanes.

  Although their was uncertainty as to exactly how accurately the behaviors of

  the models reproduced those of the full-size airplane, the comparative results

  gave useful information. Failure of a part of the full-size airplane is simulated

  by removing the corresponding part of the model before ditching. The models

  tested were the SB2C-1, B-17, B-32, B-24, B-25, and B-29. Tests were made in

  Tank # 2 and using the seaway catapult. Most of the models dived when ditched,

  but than can be prevented by the use of a hydroflap, hydrofoil, or hydrospoiler

  under the nose or by reinforcement of the bomb-bay doors to prevent their failure

  when ditching. Through the cooperation of the Army Air Forces, it was possible

  to ditch and Actual B-24 under controlled conditions. The airplane was ditched

  in the James River. Despite extensive reinforcement the airplane was damaged

  severely. From the comparison of the ditching of the full-size B-24 with the

  tests of models it was concluded that tests of model give very good approximations

  of the behavior of the full-size airplanes.<br>

Catapult tests were made, using the seaway catapult at Langley

  Field, VA., to determine the ditching performance of the Army B-17F airplane.

  For the tests a 1/16 scale dynamic wooden model was used. The flaps were semi-fixed

  in the down position. Representative power-off landings were made from high,

  medium, and low altitudes, at angles of attack of 3 1/2-degrees, 7-degrees,

  and 10-degrees and airspeeds of 98, 110, and 122 MPH, in smooth water, across

  the waves and along the waves for the complete model and for the model in a

  damaged condition in which failure of the nose window, bomb-bay doors, camera

  hatch, lower turret, rear entrance door, tail wheel well, and rear gunner's

  entrance door simulate. Two three-wheel landings at angle of attack of 0-degrees

  and 135 MPH airspeed are also shown. Smooth water tests were made with the

  bomb-bay doors and gun turret in position and hydroflap installed to increase

  the landing run and to keep the nose clear.

  <b>B-24 Ditching Instrumentation</b><br>16mm<br>
  <br>

  <b>B-24 Ditching with Hydro-Scoop</b><br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

A method considered for improving the water performance of land

  planes during ditching requires a hydro-scoop to be installed on the rear part

  of the fuselage. To determine the full-scale hydrodynamic characteristics of

  a hydro-scoop, one was installed on a B-24 airplane which was ditched at the

  AAF Proving Ground Command at Eglin Field, Florida. The experiment was made

  cooperatively by the NACA; which developed, designed, and built the instrument;

  and the AAF. A NACA photo-observer incorporating instruments to record airspeed,

  attitude and longitudinal deceleration was a part of the instrumentation. Eight

  gun-sight cameras were equipped with special wide -angle lenses and installed

  in waterproof housings. The B-24 was flown to the ditching site by radio control

  from the C-45 mother plane. It had been planned to land the airplane on the

  water at a high (near stall) attitude with a low forward speed. However, due

  to the pilot's inability to judge the airplane's altitude, it contacted the

  water at a 1-degree nose-down attitude, with a speed of 107 MPH, and a rate

  of descent of 9 fps. Because of the temporary failure of the instrument radio

  switch, the photo-observer and damage cameras did not start recording until

  1 second after impact, at which time the damage cameras were submerged, and

  the record of the damage occurring during ditching had to be obtained from

  observation by divers. The airplane was severely damaged, leaving a stream

  of debris in its wake, and sank within 6 minutes. Since the hydro-scoop was

  designed to be effective in a high-attitude landing, the experiment did not

  give and evaluation of the effectiveness of the hydro-scoop as a ditching aid.

  Graphs of attitude and deceleration showing the time-history of the airplane

  during the ditching run are presented. The airplane ran only 3 lengths after

  contacting the water, and had a maximum deceleration of 4 G, which occurred

  immediately after contact.

  <b>B-24 Wheel Pictures</b><br>

  16mm<br>

Presents a flight investigation of the effects of landing impact

  on horizontal tail loads. Landings were made with the main wheels in one of

  3 positions; (1) initially stationary but free to rotate, (2) prerotated, (3)

  locked with brakes. Landings were made at ground speeds of 96, 101, 103, 107,

  114, and 122 MPH; at vertical velocities of 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.2, 6.7, and 6.9

  FPS; at attitude angles of -0.0, 3.2, 2.9, and 4.8-degrees; normal accelerations

  0.6g, 0.8g, 1.05g, 1.12, and 1.55g. The landing gear frequency and frequency

  of the horizontal tail in symmetrical bendings are substantially the same about

  7 cycles/sec. Occasionally both main wheels touch at these same time and the

  fore-and-aft oscillations are in phase. When this happens the tail approaches

  resonance with the landing gear, and tail vibrations of increasing amplitude

  occur, although the amplitudes of the landing gear oscillations are decreasing.

  Tail loads are greatly reduced when the wheel oscillations are eliminated by

  pre-rotation or braking.

  <b>Countersunk Rivets</b><br>

  16mm<br>

Presents a comparison of tightness of joints constructed by the

  use of 3 classes of machine-countersunk rivets for aircraft. Those of class

  1 have an annular gap around the rived head caused when the hole is countersunk

  to a depth greater than the height of the rivet head. The height of the heads

  of rivets in class 2 is equal to the depth of the hole, thus forming no gap

  and increasing the tightness of the connection. Rivets of class 3 are those

  whose heads protrude above the surface. These are the tightest rivets when

  preformed countersunk heads are used. A still tighter flush rivet can be obtained

  by inserting a round-head rivet from the back and forming the countersunk head

  by driving. For the 2 tightest rivets, the heads protrude above the skin surface

  after driving. The protruding portion of the heads is removed by a flush-rivet

  milling tool, which may be set to shave off the heads very close to the surface.

  Desirable aerodynamic smoothness is obtained by painting or polishing the surface.

The model was tested at

  two different elevations with the wing pivot at 1.008 and 2.425 propeller diameters

  above the ground. The slipstream of the propellers was deflected by tilting

  the wing and propellers, by deflections of large-chord trailing-edge flaps,

  and by combinations of flap deflection and wing tilt. Tests were conducted

  over a range of propeller disk loadings from 7.41 to 29.70 pounds per square

  foot. Force data for the complete model and pressure distributions for the

  wing and flaps behind one propeller were recorded and are presented in tabular

  form without analysis.  <br>

  of 12,151 lbs. and C.G. at 162.15 in. aft of station 0 and 11.12 in. below

  the fuselage reference line, were full scale. Tests were made with no damage

  simulates; with the nose-wheel door dented and crumpled. Skipping caused by

  the curvature of the underside of the fuselage, was noticeable at all conditions

  but was most violent in the undamaged condition. Attitude angles were 12-degrees,

  8-degrees, and 2-degrees; flap deflections were 0-degrees and 40-degrees; and

  speeds were 93.9, 104.3, 118.2, and 128.7 knots. The landing flaps always failed

  and had no detrimental effect on the ditching behavior; therefore, most tests

  were made with the flaps extended at 40-degrees. The preferred attitude for

  ditching was found to be 12-degrees.

16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

  Ditching tests were made in calm water in Tank #2 on a 1/8-scale

  model of the Navy SB2C-1 airplane (Army A-25) to obtain effect of attitude,

  damage, flap setting and the effect of the arresting gear hook upon ditching.

  Gross Weight of the airplane was 12,060 lbs.; C.G. at 30.2% MAC and 1.2 in.

  below the thrust line auxiliary elevators, near the top of the rudder, were

  used to obtain the desired attitudes; spoilers were placed on the wing at all

  speeds above 78.2 knots to decrease the lift to the proper value; and scale

  strength flaps were used. Test doors, removed; and with bomb-sight doors and

  bomb-lever doors, bomb-bay doors, removed; and with bomb-sight doors and bomb-lever

  doors removed; at attitudes of 80-degrees (intermediate) and 15-degrees (tail

  down); speeds of 86.6, 78.2, 104.3, 112.9, 60.8, 95.6, and 69.6 knots; maximum

  longitudinal decelerations of 1.2, 1.3, 4.0, 1.4, 1.8, 7.6, 5.2, 4.8, 2.3,

  7.4, 5.1, and 4.2 g; lengths of run from 2 to 26 times the fuselage length;

  with flaps full up, half down, and full down. The effect of the arresting gear

  was to cause the behavior of the model to change from skipping and porpoising

  to a violent drive.

  <b>Ditching Tests Navy XP2V-1-- Part 1</b><br>

  16mm<br>

Ditching tests of a 1/16 Scale model of the Navy XP2V-1 airplane

  were made in calm water at the Langley Tank #2 monorail to determine the effect

  of landing attitude, position of the landing flaps, damage, and ditching aid

  on the ditching behavior of the airplane. Scale strength flaps were used and

  all values, weight, 45,000lb., C.G. at 29.3% MAC and 3.1 in. above thrust line;

  are full scale. Tests were made with no damage simulated to determine the effect

  of re-enforcing the bottom of the fuselage sufficiently to withstand the water

  loads of a ditching to determine the hydrodynamic effect of the landing flap.

  The bottom of the fuselage is unusually weak and so would be difficult to reinforce

  adequately. Tests were made with the nose-wheel doors, main-wheel doors, bomb-bay

  doors, radar turret, rear entrance door, and tow sections of the fuselage bottom

  aft of the bomb bays removed to simulate their failure. In this condition,

  the model dived. The simplest method of eliminating this diving would be the

  installation of a hydroflap under the forward party of the fuselage. When the

  hydroflap was located at the forward edge of the nose-wheel, door, the model

  continued to dive; but when it was relocated at the aft part of the nose-wheel,

  door, the diving was prevented. Tests were made attitude angles of 10-degrees,

  6-degrees, and 2-degrees; with flaps up and full down; over a speed range from

  71 to 211 knots.

  of landing attitude, landing flaps, and damage on the ditching behavior of

  the airplane. Scale strength flaps were used and all values, including weight

  of 9,706 lbs. and C.G. at 32.0% MAC and 5.75 in. above the thrust line, are

  full scale. runs were made with no damage simulated, to determine the behavior

  of the undamaged model and the effect of the landing flaps; with the engine

  access panel, engine removable pane, arresting gear door, main landing gear

  doors, fuel-pump access door, catapult doors, gun-access doors, and nose-wheel

  door removed to simulator their failure; and with engine access panel, and

  the engine removable panel, and the engine mounding system at approximately

  scale strength, to more accurately determine the amount of damage to be expected

  on the after fuselage, and the resulting motions. With the model in undamaged

  condition, the landing flaps always failed and had no detrimental effect on

  the ditching behavior, however violent trimming up and skipping was due to

  the shape of the aft portion of the fuselage. The attitude angles were 12-degrees,

  8-degrees, and 4-degrees; flap deflection was 27-degrees; and speeds were 97.3,

  106.9, and 123.3 knots. Pictures of the typical bottom damage at all attitudes

  were shown when tests were made with scale strength portions mentioned above.

  airplane to determine the effect of landing attitude, position of land flaps,

  and damage. Scale strength flaps were used. Model tests with no simulated damage

  were used to determine the performance that would occur if the bottom could

  be adequately reinforced to prevent damage during ditching. Tests were also

  made with simulated failure of the nose-wheel doors and simulated crumpling

  aft of the nose-wheel doors. The scale-strength bottom was made of a light

  balsa framework covered with waterproof tissue paper, built to break under

  a uniformly distributed load of 5 pounds per square inch (full scale). Attitude

  range from 1-degree to 9-degrees, the flaps were full up or full down, and

  the speeds ranged from 91-132 MPH.

  <b>Ditching Tests-North American F-86</b><br>

 16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

 Tests were made in calm water at the Tank #2 Monorail on a 1/10-scale

  model of the North American F-86 to determine the effect of Landing Attitude,

  landing flaps, and damage of the ditching behavior of the airplane. Scale-strength

  flaps were used and the first tests were made with no damage simulated. All

  tests were run at attitudes of 14-degrees, 9-degrees, and 4-degrees; with flaps

  at 0-degrees or 38-degrees; and at speeds ranging from 98 to 132 knots. The

  behavior at 14-degrees and 9-degrees; is considered satisfactory but the dive

  at 4-degrees is undesirable. The underside of the aft fuselage is weak enough

  is to incur some structural failure in calm-water ditching, so the next runs

  were made with the simulated crumpled bottom installed. At this condition,

  the runs were shorter, and the decelerations were higher. Next the empty 207

  gallon wing fuel tanks were attached and runs made. The tanks seemed to suck

  the model under, so it is preferred that the wing-fuel tanks be jettisoned

  before a ditch is attempted. The results show that the preferred ditching conditions

  are 14-degrees attitude, flaps deflected 38-degrees and a speed of 98 knots.

  the carrier were free from smoke so that fire stations could be set up in those

  areas, and therefore defense against enemy planes would be better since visibility

  would be clearer in those areas. The tests were made at airspeed of 1 MPH for

  all conditions and with deck guns pointing to bow, astern and broadside; with

  5 in. turret guns parallel to the center line of the ship, to starboard, and

  to port; and angles of fire deck guns on port, high and low, and on starboard,

  ventilated flows which have been derived from the experimental data are presented.

  In addition, certain broad conclusions pertinent to model testing and full-scale

  design are reached. Further experimentation to define the inception of ventilation

  as a function of boundary-layer state or Reynolds number is required.

  <b>FFT Hinged Tip Sequence Tech Film #18</b><br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

Flight tests were made in the free-flight tunnel to determine

  the effect on lateral stability and control of fuel-carrying wing-tip extensions

  hinged so at to reduce the loads imposed on with structure. The wing-tip extensions

  of the model were ballasted to represent tips loaded with fuel and having about

  the same wing loading as the model without the tip extensions. With the tips

  fastened rigidly, the model flies more smoothly than the basic model because

  of the increased damping in roll and the higher moments of inertia. The higher

  moments of inertia, however, make it more difficult to control. with the tips

  hinged to the chordwise axis the model is more difficult to fly than when the

  tip are rigidly attached because of the erratic motions of the tips. The tip

  hinge axis skewed 20-degrees, the tip movement is reduced, but still large

  and the model does not fly well. The skew angle was increased to 45-degrees

  and although the amplitude of the tip motions were reduced, they were still

  objectionably large. Next tests were made with wing tips with 14% chord flaps

  linked to move up when the tip went up and down and the tip went down. The

  flaps were geared to give 20-degrees deflection for 1-degree tip deflections.

  These linked flaps, although theoretically only as effective as the 45-degree

  skewed hinge line, resulted in smaller tip motions and mad the model easier

  to fly. With a 20% chord flap and gearing increased to 3-degrees flap for 1-degree

  tip movement of the tips relative to the wing was virtually eliminated, and

  the model was easier to fly.

An experimental investigation has been conducted to determine

  the dynamic stability and control characteristics of a tilt-wing vertical-take-off-and-landing

  aircraft with the use of a remotely controlled 1/4-scale free-flight model.

  The model had two propellers with hinged (flapping) blades mounted on the wing

  which could be tilted up to an incidence angle of nearly 90 deg for vertical

  take-off and landing. The investigation consisted of hovering flights in still

  air, vertical take-offs and landings, and slow constant-altitude transitions

  from hovering to forward flight. The stability and control characteristics

  of the model were generally satisfactory except for the following characteristics.

  In hovering flight, the model had an unstable pitching oscillation of relatively

  long period which the pilots were able to control without artificial stabilization

  but which could not be considered entirely satisfactory. At very low speeds

  and angles of wing incidence on the order of 70 deg, the model experienced

  large nose-up pitching moments which severely limited the allowable center-of-gravity

  range.

An investigation of the stability and control

  of a high-wing transport vertical-take-off airplane with four engines during

  constant-altitude transitions from hovering to normal forward flight was conducted

  with a remotely controlled free-flight model. The model had four propellers

  distributed along the wing with the thrust axes in the wing chord plane. The

  wing could be rotated to 90 degrees incidence so that the propeller thrust

  axes were vertical for hovering flight. An air jet at the rear of the fuselage

  provided pitch and yaw control for hovering and low-speed flight.

  <b>Fluctuations in Supersonic Inlets</b><br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

The phenomenon of flow fluctuation in supersonic inlets is investigated

  at the following subcritical conditions. Tests were made at Mach number 1.92

  on an inlet having 30-degrees cone and 12 to 17-degrees cowling and no internal

  contraction. The Mach number at the cone surface is 1.20. The subcritical condition

  is stable until the boundary flow is supersonic at the jet boundary. The system

  of throttling is then changed and fluctuation phenomena is completely modified.

  Frequency and amplitude of fluctuation changed when tests were made at Mach

  number 1.92 on an inlet having 20-degrees cone and 13-17-degrees cowling and

  on internal contraction. The Mach number at the cone surface of 1.51 is too

  high. The subcritical condition is not stable and no regulation of volume flow

  is possible. The remaining tests were made at Mach number 2.70. No stable subcritical

  condition was possible for an inlet having 22-degrees cone and 4 to 7-degree

  cowl and internal contraction, when the Mach number at the cone surface was

  2.02, an inlet having 40-degree cone and 16 to 24 degree cowl and Mach number

  at the surface 1.23 was tested. In the final test an inlet having gradual external

  compression and a low mach number at the surface at the entrance was tested,

  but subcritical conditions were not stable because of the existence of separation.

  up to 500 MPH. Of increasing importance is flutter involving all three vibrations;

  bending, torsion, and aileron motion about the hinge. Any two or all of these

  motions must be present simultaneously for flutter exist. Illustrations of

  each of these motions and combinations are presented.

  <b>Flutter TBF-1 16' W.T.</b><br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

Flutter tests were made on a full-scale TBF-1 aileron installation

  in the 16 ft. high-speed tunnel. The model tested was an outer section of a

  production wing panel of the TBF-1 airplane. Aerodynamic tests were made of

  the wing-aileron installation to determine whether the aileron had contributed

  to the failures that have occurred in the service of the airplane. Flutter

  of this tests model occurred at airspeeds of about 150MPH. On the TBF-1 the

  wing panel is attached at 2 points at approximately 10 and 40% chord, therefore,

  the chordwise stiffness is low. Lacking chordwise rigidity, chordwise motion

  occurred. The C.G. of the aileron is forward of the hinge line, and therefore

  classical wing-aileron flutter was not possible. However, the method of attachment

  of the aileron to the wing panel places the C.G. 2.17 in. above the hinge line.

  The aileron is, therefore, deflected by inertia forces when chordwise motion

  and its attendant chordwise accelerations occur. Rearward motion of the wing

  therefore produces of negative aileron angle and forward motion of the wing

  a positive aileron angle. The alternation up and down aileron produces simple

  wing bending due to lift changes. No torsional deflection of the wing evident.

  In order to verify the fact that the chordwise motion was essential to flutter

  condition, the chordwise rigidity was greatly increased by the insertion of

  a steel block between the tunnel wall and wing at approximately 80% chord.

  Flutter did not occur of this test condition and maximum tests speed was 365

  MPH. The results of this analysis indicate that flutter involving chordwise

  motion of the wing can be prevented by 2 methods: (1) By stiffening the wing

  attachment in the chordwise plane. (2) By mass-balancing the aileron in the

  normal-to-chord plane.

  <b>Flutter Tests of XPB2M-1</b><br>

 16mm<br>
 Flutter tests were made on a model of the Martin PBM-1 seaplane

  to determine if a low flutter speed exists because of the elastic coupling

  between wing and engine, the ultimate flutter speed, and the wing divergence

  speed. Certain structural weaknesses were disclosed by the tests. The model,

  made of the plastic pyrolin has characteristic speed ratio of 3.61. Flutter

  speed calculation gave a value of 98.5 MPH corresponding to 355.6 MPH for the

  original seaplane. The calculated divergence speed was 95 MPH and the divergence

  first appeared at 94 MPH. Tin this case, divergence speed is less than flutter

  speed so no flutter appeared. It was concluded that the torsion axis is too

  far rearward, particularly at the tip; and no low flutter velocity is introduced

  by engine, which was proved to have a desirable effect on wing stability. In

  test # 1 the fuselage was freely suspended, angel of attack was 0-degrees,

  and airspeed ranged from 25 to 64 MPH. In test # 2 the left wing & fuselage were fixed, wing tip was overloaded, angles of attack were 0-degrees and 4-degrees, & airspeed ranged from 56.4 to 69 MPH.  In test # 3, for angles of attack 2-degrees and 1.5-degrees and airspeed range 61.3 to 73.5 MPH, the fuselage & lead

  weight was attached to the leading edge to bring center of gravity forward.

  In test # 4 the fuselage was again freely suspended and both wings were free

  with lead weight on the leading edges, angel of attack was 0-degrees and airspeeds

  ranged from 74-96 MPH.

 16mm<br>

 Flight tests were made in the free-flight and free-spinning tunnels

  on a model of the Kaiser-Hughes tailless airplane. In the free-flight tunnel

  the model was tested with original wing tip vertical tails, which gave large

  yaw angles when ailerons were used to hold wings level, and with wing tip tails

  replaced by equal area high aspect ratio tails at the trailing edge, which

  considerably reduced yawing. Unstable oscillations developed when elevators

  were not used. For the tumbling tests in the free-spinning tunnel, models of

  the Kaiser, Bell P-39 and Northrop N-9M airplanes were released in a nose-up

  attitude, simulating a whip stall. The air-speeds were 19 and 39 fps. The P-39

  went into a dive and would not tumble, and the N-9M tumbled sometimes and went

  down 45-degrees to improve lateral stability and control. Ailerons alone were

  used for control and adverse yawing due to the ailerons caused difficulty in

  controlling the model. Weights were added fore and aft on center line to improve

  longitudinal behavior, but stability and control were unaffected. Weights were

  add at wing tips; this caused difficulty in flying the model. Lateral control

  appeared weaker and damping of lateral oscillations was light. C.G. positions

  were 16% and 17% MAC.

 Reel 1 presents flight tests made in the free-flight and free

  spinning-tunnels on a 1/30 scale model of the Consolidated-Vultee Tailless

  airplane. Tests were made with and without slots, with vertical tail surfaces

  on the fuselage, with tip vertical tail surfaces, or no tail surfaces; with

  no propellers or propellers windmilling. In the flaps down condition, extensible

  horizontal tail surfaces appear, but they form fort of the trailing edge of

  the wing in the flaps up condition. Reel 2 presents flight tests made in the

  free-flight tunnel on a 1/35 scale model of revised consolidated-Vultee tailless

  airplane in the flaps up condition. The model has tufts on the root of the

  wings showing air flow over the wing.

  the heavy wing loading of approximately 2.27 lbs./sq.ft., the weight and moments

  of inertia were scaled down from the full-scale airplane. A light with loading

  of approximately 1.79 lbs./ sq. ft. was also used. The control used on the

  model is a 'Flicker' (full-on or full-off) system. In all flights the elevons

  and rudder were applied simultaneously for the lateral control. The control

  travels from the trim positions were +-70degrees elevons, =-50 elevons for

  the longitudinal control, and =-10degrees for lateral control. The lifter coefficient

  <b>Hovering and Transition Flight Tests of a 1/5-Scale Model of a Jet Powered

  Vertical Altitude VTOL Research Airplane. </b><br>1958<br>

 16mm, Silent, Color, 550ft., 15min.<br>
 An experimental investigation has been made to determine the dynamic

  stability and control characteristics of a 1/5-scale flying model of a jet-powered

  vertical-attitude VTOL research airplane in hovering and transition flight.

  The model was powered with either a hydrogen peroxide rocket motor or a compressed-air

  jet exhausting through an ejector tube to simulate the turbojet engine of the

  airplane. The gyroscopic effects of the engine were simulated by a flywheel

  driven by compressed-air jets. In hovering flight the model was controlled

  by jet-reaction controls which consisted of a swiveling nozzle on the main

  jet and a movable nozzle on each wing tip; and in forward flight the model

  was controlled by elevons and a rudder. If the gyroscopic effects of the jet

  engine were not represented, the model could be flown satisfactorily in hovering

  flight without any automatic stabilization devices. When the gyroscopic effects

  of the jet engine were represented, however, the model could not be controlled

  without the aid of artificial stabilizing devices because of the gyroscopic

  coupling of the yawing and pitching motions. The use of pitch and yaw dampers

  made these motions completely stable and the model could then be controlled

  very easily. In the transition flight tests, which were performed only with

  the automatic pitch and yaw dampers operating, it was found that the transition

  was very easy to perform either with or without the engine gyroscopic effects

  simulated, although the model had a tendency to fly in a rolled and sideslipped

  attitude at angles of attack between approximately 25 deg and 45 deg because

  of static directional instability in this range.

  mounting a section of wing on an airplane. A device to provide an atomized

  spray of water was placed ahead of the model wing. The tests were made at altitudes

  to obtain a temperature of 26-degrees F. This method used leather covering

  over the leading edge. Alcohol was applied under pressure to the inner surface

  and forced through the leather. About 40 lbs. of alcohol per hour is required

  to eliminate this type of ice formation on a wing of 50 ft. span. Ice formation

 16mm<br>
 The free-flight tunnel, of which external and sectional views

  are shown, is an open-return closed-throat tunnel which is housed in a metal

  sphere. The air is pulled through the test section by the propeller at the

  rear of the tunnel, which may be tilted to simulate flight path angles over

  a range from 40-degree glide to 15-degree climb. Two operators at the side

  of the tunnel control and the tunnel angle and airspeed. The pilot operates

  the model control remotely from his seat at the rear of the tunnel. The pilot's

  controls consist of a rudder-aileron stick and an elevator stick which operates

  electric switches, which control the current which flows through a light flexible

  cable of electromagnets in the model. The electromagnets are linked to the

  hinged control surfaces and, when the magnets are energized, the surfaces are

  moved. For a take-off, the tunnel angle is brought up and the airspeed increased.

  After take-off, the tunnel angle and airspeed are adjusted to the flight trim

  conditions. The model is landed by reducing the tunnel angle and airspeed.

  The effects of design factors on dynamic stability and control ability are

  illustrated by records mad of model flight tests. From theses tests the effects

  of dihedral and vertical tail area; reducing directional stability control

  with ailerons and rudder interconnected increasing dihedral; increasing dihedral

  and decreasing directional stability and control with ailerons alone; it was

  determined that low dihedral and large vertical tail are desirable. The effects

  of AR and sweep of the wing; Damping in roll of wing-tip tanks; and of fuel

  sloshing on the lateral oscillation were shown. Longitudinal stability was

  shown to depend chiefly on the C.G. location.

An

  investigation of the low-subsonic stability and control characteristics of

  a model of a hypersonic boost-glide configuration having 78 deg. sweep of the

  leading edge has been made in the Langley full-scale tunnel. The model was

  flown over an angle-of-attack range from 10 to 35 deg. Static and dynamic force

  tests were made in the Langley free-flight tunnel. The investigation showed

  that the longitudinal stability and control characteristics were generally

  satisfactory with neutral or positive static longitudinal stability. The addition

  of artificial pitch damping resulted in satisfactory longitudinal characteristics

  being obtained with large amounts of static instability. The most rearward

  center-of-gravity position for which sustained flights could be made either

  with or without pitch damper corresponded to the calculated maneuver point.

  The lateral stability and control characteristics were satisfactory up to about

  15 deg. angle of attack. The damping of the Dutch roll oscillation decreased

  with increasing angle of attack; the oscillation was about neutrally stable

  at 20 deg. angle of attack and unstable at angles of attack of about 25 deg.

  and above. Artificial damping in roll greatly improved the lateral characteristics

  and resulted in flights being made up to 35 deg. angle of attack. 1959<br>

Brief dynamic-model tests have been made at the request of the

  Federal Aviation Agency to investigate the use of a shallow pond of water at

  the end of a runway as a means of arresting jet-transport aircraft when they

  are forced to abort on take-off or overrun on landing. Such a scheme is of

  particular interest for civil aircraft because it requires no modifications

  or attachments to the airplane and no mechanical devices in the arresting system.

  A modification of this scheme that uses a flexible plastic cover over the water

  surface has also been tested. The purpose of this paper is to present the results

  of a dynamic model investigation which would aid in determining whether the

  water-pond arresting system could be used as a means of arresting airplane

  overrun.  <br>

 As a part of a program to investigate the landing impact characteristics

  of conical reentry capsules, some tests have been reported in references 1

  and 2. Further experimental investigations have been made to determine the

  rigid-body impact accelerations of a reentry capsule having the same spherical

  impact surface as the Mercury capsule and are reported herein. The current

  investigation was made to determine impact accelerations with landings on sand

  and on water after a simulated parachute-supported let down. The flotation

  properties of the capsule also have been determined. All tests were made with

  1/6-scale dynamically similar models of the Mercury reentry capsule. The landing

  tests were made at various flight paths to simulate the effect of surface winds

  that might act on the parachute-capsule combination during letdown. A range

  of contact attitudes was investigated to simulate the various landing attitudes

  that might occur if the capsule were swinging under the parachute. The accelerations

  were measured at the center of gravity of the capsule and for some tests the

  accelerations were measured at offset positions corresponding to those a man's

  head might have in the manned capsule. The flotation properties of the capsule

  were investigated at various center-of-gravity locations. Tests were also made

  to determine the effect on the flotation properties of flooding the space between

  the passenger's compartment and the heat shield of the capsule. The effects

  of a man with his survival equipment making an exit through the canister were

  also determined. All values and measurements in the paper are given full scale.

  Originally recorded in 16mm, Silent, Color, 128ft., 3.5min.<br>

Analytical and experimental investigations have been made to determine

  the landing-energy-dissipation characteristics for several types of landing

  gear for manned reentry vehicles. The landing vehicles are considered in two

  categories: those having essentially vertical-descent paths, the parachute-supported

  vehicles, and those having essentially horizontal paths, the lifting vehicles.

  The energy-dissipation devices discussed are crushable materials such as foamed

  plastics and honeycomb for internal application in couch-support systems, yielding

  metal elements as part of the structure of capsules or as alternates for oleos

  in landing-gear struts, inflatable bags, braking rockets, and shaped surfaces

  for water impact. It appears feasible to readily evaluate landing-gear systems

  for internal or external application in hard-surface or water landings by using

  computational procedures and free-body landing techniques with dynamic models.

  The systems investigated have shown very interesting energy-dissipation characteristics

  over a considerable range of landing parameters. Acceptable gear can be developed

  along lines similar to those presented if stroke requirements and human-tolerance

  limits are considered.  <br>

A brief experimental investigation was made of the landing-impact

  characteristics of a 1/9-scale dynamic model of a winged space vehicle. The

  landing tests were made by catapulting a free model onto a hard; surface runway

  and onto water. The model had a conical fuselage and a flat - plate wing with

  a basic delta planform and 75 deg sweepback of the leading edge. The use of

  yielding-metal shock absorbers and various landing-gear arrangements was investigated

  during landing impact. The basic landing gear consisted of a dual rubber-tired

  nose wheel and twin main skids aft of the center of gravity near the wing tips.

  landing motion and acceleration data were obtained over a range of landing

  attitudes, gross weights, and initial sinking speeds. Brief tests were made

  with an alternate nose-wheel location. An all-skid configuration also was briefly

  evaluated for hard-surface and water landings. The landing gear employing yielding

  struts for impact-energy absorption during hard-surface landings resulted in

  accelerations of approximately 5 1/2 g near the nose gear over a range of landing

  parameters. Replacing the nose wheel and tire with a skid did not significantly

  change the accelerations. Landings in smooth water with rigid struts and adequate

  planning area at the nose skid resulted in a maximum landing acceleration of

  approximately 4g.  <br>

  <b>Navy Ditching Tests SB2C-1 Airplane</b><br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

Ditching tests were made using the seaway catapult at Langley

  Field, VA., on a 1/8-scale model of the SB2C-1 airplane with normal gross weight

  of 13,060 lb., and C.G. of 30.2% MAC and 1.2 in. below the thrust line. The

  tank tests indicated a more pessimistic behavior of the airplane than the catapult

  tests. The principal reason for the difference in the ditching behavior was

  that the flaps failed completely almost every time in the catapult tests while

  they seldom failed in the tank tests. The more frequent flap failure in tests

  at the outdoor catapult may be due to the higher impact loads. Higher loads

  might be caused by the rougher water surface (ripples occurred even in calm

  water) or by the slightly higher sinking speed of the model. Tests were run

  in calm water, along the wave crests, across the wave crests; with flaps full

  up or full down; with bomb-sight doors removed or with bomb-sight doors, bomb-lever

  doors, bomb-bay doors removed; at attitudes of 15-degrees, 8-degrees, or 2-degrees;

  over an airspeed range from 58-115.6 knots. Wing low landings and dives caused

  by the tail of the airplane hitting the leeward side of a wave are also shown.

  16mm<br>

Depicts drop tests to determine spin characteristics of a model

  of the NB-1 seaplane. The model was dropped from a height of 100 feet to determine

  the effect of mass distribution on the spinning characteristics. The locations

  of weights on the model were changed along the Z axis thus affecting the moments

  of inertia about the X & Y axes.  The center of gravity remained fixed at all

  times. When the weights were close to the center of gravity, the spin was flat,

  but when the weights were 9/12-inches from the center of gravity, the model

  executed a normal spin.

  amphibian had a 6.33 ft. beam, hull 35.75 ft. long, 43.60 ft. overall length,

  50 ft. wing span, 13,000 lb. maximum gross load, and load coefficient of 0.80.

  Bow spray during the beginning of take off run is shown for gross loads of

  10,800 and 13,000 lb.; C.G. at 26% MAC; flaps deflected 30-degrees; and take-off

  power. Flap spray and flow under step during a take-off run are shown for a

  gross weight of 13,000 lb.; C.G. 35% MAC; flaps deflected 30-degrees; take-off

  power; and elevators deflected to -30-degrees. A constant speed run of 42 knots

  is shown in which the trim was gradually increased from 3-degrees to the upper

  limit of 12-degrees, through the region of intemediate porpoising -8-degrees

  to 10-degrees then gradually decreased to original value. Landings at one-quarter

  take-off power are shown for gross weights of 10,800 and 13,000 lb.; with flaps

  at 60-degrees; C.G. at 24% MAC; over a trim angle range from 13-degrees to

  4-degrees.

A preliminary investigation of the aerodynamic and control characteristics

  of a flexible glider similar to a parachute in construction has been made at

  the Langley Research Center to evaluate its capabilities as a reentry glider.

  Preliminary weight estimates of the proposed vehicle indicate that such a structure

  can be made with extremely low wing loading. Maximum temperatures during the

  reentry maneuver might be held as low as about 1,500 F. The results of wind-tunnel

  and free-glide tests show that the glider when constructed of nonporous material

  performed extremely well at subsonic speeds and could be flown at angles of

  attack from about 200 to 900. At supersonic speeds the wing showed none of

  the unfavorable tendencies exhibited by conventional parachutes at these speeds,

  such as squidding and breathing. Several methods of packing and deploying the

  glider have been successfully demonstrated. The results of this study indicate

  that this flexible-lifting-surface concept may provide a lightweight controllable

  paraglider for manned space vehicles.

Presents tests run in the 16-foot high-speed tunnel on the SB2U-2

  airplane to determine the flutter speed, the frequency at which flutter occurs,

  and the behavior of the airplane at speeds below the flutter speed., The flutter

  which was found to have a frequency between those of torsion and bending, occurred

  at 16 cycles per second and flutter speed was 20% higher than the 125 MPH predicted

  speed. The vibration testing equipment, which has amplifiers, bridges and oscillograph

  recording equipment, used for the test was built by the Glenn L. Martin Co.

  There appeared in the oscillograph record a high frequency type of skin flutter

  which evidently delayed the flutter by increase in the internal damping.

  in the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory at Stanford University. First, a thorough

  study of the flow mechanism has been made using dye injection in a water table.

  The four regimes of flow found are delineated on graphs in terms of the three

  important parameters. Test data from a large water-table unit and a small water-table

  unit are given. Second, data are presented which demonstrate means for producing

  efficient diffusers for total included angles up to at least 45? by use of

  simple, short, flat vanes.

  16mm<br>
Preliminary tests of a miniature tunnel were made.  Spinning tests

  were carried out in a large vertical tunnel of the RAE which is a 30ft. high

  and 12ft. in diameter. The models used are made of balsa wood,1/15th to 1/25th

  full scale. Models are kept in jigs to prevent distortion. They are made accurately

  to scale, care being taken to obtain correct balance and mass distribution.

  Method of balancing the models was shown. The moments of inertia are obtained

  from swinging tests carried out in hydrogen to eliminate effects of the relatively

  dense air. Spins shown at 1/4th of their actual speed. A dangerous flat spin

  was made and then the same model with raised tail was used. This insures a

  steeper spin from which recovery is easy. The use of a dashpot to change control

  positions during a spin was shown.

  <b>Spray Characteristics of Model 203</b><br>

  1945<br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

Spray characteristics tests were made in Tank #1 on a 1/10-scale

  powered dynamic model with a hull having a length-beam ration of 9.0 (NACA

  model 203). The model is the first of a series to investigate the effect of

  high length-beam ration on the stability and spray of multi-engined flying-boats.

  The wing, tail surfaces, power plant, depth of hull, basic deadrise and angle

  of afterbody keel are the same as for the Navy XPBB-1 seaplane. The test conditions

  and spray patterns shown correspond directly to a full-scale XPBB-1 with the

  hull length-beam ration increased and a reduction of hull frontal area of 23%,

  a reduction in volume of 10%, and a reduction of hull surface are of 4%. Take-off

  runs with full power were made at 1 ft/sec [2nd power] acceleration, with flaps

  down 20-degrees, elevators up 10-degrees for gross loads of 62,000 and 92,000

  lbs. Spray striking wing and tail with propellers windmilling as high and severe

  at a gross load of 62,000 lb. The spray without power tends to impair seaworthiness

  during landings only. It follows that when hull dimensions are determined by

  spray characteristics alone, high length-beam ration offers a means of reducing

  hull frontal area and volume.

  <b>Summary Results- Ditching Investigations of Five Transport Films (Training Film 19)</b><br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

The NACA is investigating, with models, the ditching characteristics

  of a series of transport airplanes, including the Lockheed Constellation (with

  and without Speed Pack attached), Lockheed Constitution, Douglas DC-4 and DC-6,

  and Boeing Stratocruiser, in calm water. Scale dynamic models with scale strength

  bottoms, made of balsa wood or cardboard bulkheads and balsa stringers and

  covered with waterproof paper or aluminum sheet, are launched so that they

  glide freely onto the water. The scale strength bottom sections are used to

  determine the extent of the damage that may be expected and the resulting behavior

  of the airplane. The ditchings are made with flaps full-down, at landing attitudes

  ranging from 4-degrees to 12-degrees, and speeds ranging from 81 to 118 mph.

  Transports give better ditchings than bombers because there is less damage

  and the decelerations are lower. However, transports carry more people and

  passengers are normally untrained in ditching procedure so the survival problem

  is more acute. In rough-water ditchings are made perpendicular to the waves

  more damage and violence may occur, depending on the choice of the ditching

  site and portion of the waves contacted.

  as rivet heads; or using a small auxiliary airfoil ahead of the main one to

  obtain turbulence; controlling boundary layer by use of suction slots (NACA

  16mm, Silent, Color<br>

Second progress report on tests of NACA hydro-skis for high-speed

  airplanes. Take-off tests show that, for the speed range of 15-30 MPH full

  size (before the skis emerge), some water is drawn into the intake ducts on

  the original model. However, when the skis emerge, the spray is moving outward

  and only a few tray drops enter the ducts during this transition. The addition

  of a small strip extending only 3.4 in. full size from the fuselage keeps the

  spray clear of the intakes. Take-offs with the strips installed show that the

  water is now kept a considerable distance below the intakes during the critical

  15 to 30 MPH speed range. The water is directed away from the model in addition

  to being kept below the intakes. The strips required to keep spray from entering

  the turbojet intakes are very small and presumably would have such a negligible

  aerodynamic effect that their retraction would not be warranted. 

 <br>
  <br>

  <b>Tank Model 229; Part 1</b><br>

  1947<br>

  16mm<br>

An investigation of the opportunities opened for the seaplane

  by jet propulsion is now under way at Langley Laboratory. This film is a progress

  report on a part of this investigation, tests of NACA hydro-skis for high-speed

  airplanes, which has shown marked possibilities. A 1/2-scale dynamically similar

  model of a hypothetical airplane, representative of current thought on high

  speed design is being used for the investigation. The fuselage form chosen

  for the airplane is such that turbojet and rocket powered plants could exhaust

  at the rear, and a possible turbojet intake location is shown on the top of

  the fuselage. NACA twin-ski arrangement hydro-skis, curved to permit flush

  retraction into the fuselage, are retractable planning surfaces extended below

  the airplane during take-off and landing and retracted in flight to eliminate

  their drag. The area of the skis is no more than 1/3 the area required for

  snow skis. For the take-off tests, the model is attached to the towing carriage

  of Tank #2 so that it is free to move vertically and to pitch about it's center

  of gravity; it has a gross weight corresponding to 13,140 lbs; floats with

  the wing tips slightly under the water and the wings thus provide lateral stability;

  runs as a displacement body, until a speed corresponding to 40 MPH full-size

  is reached, hen the hydro-skis emerge from the water; from this speed to take-off

  (148 MPH) the model rides on the hydro-skis; and the entire take-off is stable

  even though controls are fixed. It is assumed that the airplane has consumed

  fuel until its weight is reduced to 8,740 lbs. before landing, and for the

  landing tests, the model weight is reduced accordingly. The mode is catapulted;

  from the seaway catapult at Langley Field, Va., over open water as a free body

  and lands without benefit of longitudinal or lateral control such as a pilot

  could apply. On landing, the model rides on the hydro-skis until it decelerates

  to a speed considerably lower than the take-off emergence speed before dropping

  to a level where it is supported by buoyancy. The stability in roll during

  landing is very good. Waves up to 2 ft. high full-size have a very slight effect

  on the landing characteristics. The resistance during take-off is great enough

  to require the use of JATO. With a reasonable amount of research the resistance

  could be reduced sufficiently to eliminate the need. Many phases of research

  on hydro-skis are yet to be done; however, the results from preliminary experiments

  show that their use makes possible the design of an airplane that is extra-ordinarily

  clean aerodynamically and is capable of taking off and landing in any sheltered

  body of water.

An experimental study was made on five 2024-T3 aluminum-alloy

  multiweb wing structures (MW-2-(4), MW-4-(3), mw-16, MW-17, and MW-18), at

  a Mach number of 2 and an angle of attack of 2 deg under simulated supersonic

  flight conditions. These models, of 20-inch chord and semi-span and 5-percent-thick

  circular-arc airfoil section, were identical except for the type and amount

  of chordwise stiffening. One model with no chordwise ribs between root and

  tip bulkhead fluttered and failed dynamically partway through its test. Another

  model with no chordwise ribs (and a thinner tip bulkhead) experienced a static

  bending type of failure while undergoing flutter. The three remaining models

  with one, two, or three chordwise ribs survived their tests. The test results

  indicate that the chordwise shear rigidity imparted to the models by the addition

  of even one chordwise rib precludes flutter and subsequent failure under the

  imposed test conditions. This paper presents temperature and strain data obtained

  from the tests and discusses the behavior of the models.

A wind-tunnel investigation was made to study the behavior of

  a model helicopter rotor under extreme operating conditions. A 1/8-scale model

  of the front rotor of a tandem helicopter was built and tested to obtaining

  blade motion and rotor aerodynamic characteristics for conditions that could

  be encountered in high-speed pullout maneuvers. The data are presented without

  <b>Wind Tunnel Tests of Opening Characteristics of Various Baseball-Type

  Hemispherical Parachute Demonstration </b><br>1948<br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

Opening characteristics tests of various Baseball type hemispherical

  parachutes were made in the 7x10-foot tunnel. Types D-385, 389, 390, 391, 392,

  393, and 394 of diameters 12 in. and 30 in. were opened in the tunnel at airspeed

  of 200 MPH. Type D-358 opened to a pear shape and retained this shape as airspeed

  was reduced to zero. Type D-389 opened only partially and the canopy started

  tearing. Type D-391 did not open and the canopy started tearing. These three

  parachutes had floating hemlines, but the rest had tacked hemlines. Type D-392

  opened completely except that loops were slightly extended. Types 3-393 and

  D-390 did not open and the canopies started tearing, but as the airspeed was

  lowered, the parachutes tended to open a little. Type D-394 was opened to a

  slight pear shape and as the airspeed decreased, the parachute opened a little

  more. Results of the tests indicate that good openings require: long shroud

  lines, tacked hemlines, and low-porosity lower panel. The porosities of the

  lower panels varied from 96-318.

  of the XFG-1 glider in the free-flight tunnel at the request of the Army Air

  Force Air Technical Service Command, Wright Field. The model was ballasted

  to simulate a gross weight of 5100 lb. at 15,00 ft. with the C.G. at 15% MAC.

  Trifurcated tow arrangement used with a four span towline. Through speed range

  with spoilers off model appears fairly stable at times, unstable at others;

  with spoilers on it is very steady laterally but a gradually worsening pitching

  oscillation becomes apparent at higher speeds. At a velocity of 68 MPH, with

  spoilers retracted, lateral stability unsatisfactory; but with spoilers deflected,

  lateral and longitudinal stability are satisfactory. The speed range is from

  40 to 95 MPH and the flight path is 5-degree climb.

  16mm, Silent, Color<br>

Dive tests of XP-51 in flight were made for the purpose of obtaining

  fundamental data on the aerodynamic loads at high speed. The pictures show

  the location of the compression shock on the upper surface of the wing, the

  turbulent behavior of the flow behind the shock and resulting vibration of

  the airplane at the higher values of Mach number. These phenomena are correlated

  with pressure distribution and drag measurements made during the tests. Dives

  were made to mach numbers of 0.73, 0.78, and 0.80 with acceleration in the

  pull-out at 5.0g, 5.1g, and 5.3g, respectively. The vibration, resulting from

  the turbulent wing wake striking the tail at the highest Mach number and acceleration,

  was severe. No faster dives were attempted for the reason. The pressure diagrams

  for the upper surface of the wing show the location of minimum pressure & of

  the shock at 3 stages of the dive and pull-out. Instruments shown in the picture

  include altimeter, Mach number meter, and dive-angle indicator. Wing tufts

  disclosed change in flow conditions behind the shock. The total drag of the

  airplane as well as the profile drag on one section of the wing was measured

  in the dives.

  1946<br>

  16mm, Silent, Black & White<br>

Transonic flutter tests were made in the 16 ft. high-speed tunnel

  at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory on a partial-span wing of the Lockheed

  YP-80A in an attempt to eliminate the flutter. Shadowgraphs were taken at approximately

  0.81 Mach number and zero lift in order to visualize the shock waves. In each

  case the aileron was restrained until the desired Mach number was attained

  and after a short flutter the aileron was again restrained. Aileron flutter

  with control cables loose was shown. Shadowgraphs for the standard wing and

  aileron showed that when the aileron fluttered the shock waves followed its

  motion with approximately 45-degrees lag. The flutter is believed to be the

  result of coupling between the aileron and shock motion through the change

  in separation associated with shock. Various modifications to the wing and

  aileron, as: spoilers on upper and lower surfaces at 50%-chord; bulges on upper

  and lower surfaces at 50% and 70%-chord; addition to the upper surface so as

  to taper the wing thickness from 15% of the chord at the tunnel wall to 13%

  at the tip; holes in the upper only, and in upper and lower wing surface 3

  in. forward of aileron hinge; change in aileron contour so as to have flat

  sides with an included angle of 12-degrees; were all tested. None of the aerodynamic

  means which have been tried to date were successful in preventing the flutter.

  A small amount of damping prevented flutter at the highest Mach number attained

  in the wind tunnel, 0.825.
