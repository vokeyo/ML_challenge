A display of northern lights started 9:15 p.m. of the 2nd. The 
display was characterized by rapid changes in the shapes and sizes 
of the streamers, which at times reached about 15 degrees south of 
zenith. They were of a dull greenish color, and shortly after 
first appearing were in a brilliant light which gradually lost 
intensity and practically disappeared by 11:00 p.m. A short time 
later, however, they reoccurred in a brilliance exceeding that of 
the first display. Gradual fading then set in, and the northern 
lights disappeared entirely at 3:08 a.m. of the 3rd.

midnight to 4:30 a.m. again on the night of the 18th and 19th 
beginning at 6:50 p.m. and continuing except for a period near 
midnight until dawn. The first one was observed as a pale glow 
along the horizon up to about 8o but by 12:45 a.m. the shafts of 
pale green appeared and continued until the end. The display on 
the night of the 18-19th was the most brilliant witnessed in this 
section for many years, with the streamers of pale green vibrating 
and appearing from all quadrants converging at the zenith.

Aurora Borealis became brilliant before 8:00 p.m., attaining 
greatest intensity 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. At 8:25, the most noticeable 
feature was a dark bow in northern sky from which streamers darted 
toward the zenith. At 8:35 a light streak extended from horizon 
Az. 290o, entirely across the dome, through the zenith, to Az. 
270o on the eastern horizon. At the frequent intervals streaks 
like searchlight beams converged from all directions to a focal 
point near the zenith. Adequate description is precluded by the 
variety of manifestations and rapidity of changes, far exceeding 
those noted by this observer in March, 1918, the only comparable 
display recalled. Colors of streamers most pronounced in western 
sky, and were pink, red, and green predominating. No portion of 
the dome but what showed some display at one time or another. 
Landscape illumination was equivalent to that of a clear moon at 
quarter. Display faded somewhat after 11 p.m., but still faintly 
visible for some time thereafter, and some evidences of it 
continued to 4:30 a.m. of the 19th.

On the 18th, an aurora was observed from 1:00 to 1:30 a.m. It was 
very slight and no streamers were noted.

Again, on the 18th, an especially brilliant aurora was first 
observed at 7:15 p.m., and noted at times till after midnight; 
last observed at 1:30 a.m. It was most brilliant between 9:00 and 
10:00 p.m., when bands of light extended from a point in the east 
through the zenith to a point in the west. It was a beautiful 
sight with pale pink and green colors predominating. The lights 
were so bright that the effect was not unlike bright moonlight on 
the landscape. On this occasion the arch was unusually high. It 
was still very prominent till after 10:30 p.m. The lights were 
still discernable at 1:30 a.m. on the 19th, but weakening at that 
time.

1941     9   18  PROVIDENCE          RHODE ISLAND
A spectacular auroral display was observed from 8:00 p.m. to about 
midnight. The Aurora was described by Prof. Charles H. Smiley, of 
Brown University as "a most remarkable one". Masses of streamers 
formed a perfect arch across the northern sky, and continued to 
move slowly upward changing its shape from minute to minute until 
it stretched from east to west directly overhead. Between 8 and 9 
p.m. the shafts of light streaming upward formed a nearly perfect 
circle at the zenith, known to astronomers as a "corona", a 
phenomenon rarely seen in this vicinity. Light green in color 
during much of the display, but later it showed bright flashes of 
red and at one time the lower ends of the streamers were edged 
with rainbow tints, that came and went with the rapidity of 
lightning.

Northern lights were observed four times during the month, the 
brightest being the evening of the twenty ninth. At that time 
bright streamers flared from luminous clouds close to the northern 
horizon to the zenith. At 7:45 the glow covered two thirds of the 
sky and made enough illumination that quarter inch print could be 
read by it. The display of the evening of the thirtieth was not as 
bright and consisted only of glow surrounding irregular brighter 
blotches restricted to the northern quadrant and not more than 45o 
in altitude. The two displays seen earlier in the month were quite 
weak, both appeared as glow emanating from an arch shaped base 
with faint streamers also visible. Both were in the northwest 
quadrant.

The aurora observed on the evening of the 23rd was spectacular. It 
was first seen shortly after the sun had disappeared and it 
increased rapidly in brilliance and extent as twilight faded. The 
first appearance was an arch from northwest to northeast with 
short streamers, the streamers increased and the arch became 
higher and wider with the development of a smaller arch within. At 
about 1945 the lights were shooting to the zenith as though the 
northern semicircle of horizon were a great oil wick, later on the 
southern portion of the sky was filled by curtains and streamers. 
The greatest brilliance was between 2000 and 2100, the time of 
disappearance was not noted. The display was marked throughout by 
flashes of an intense red color.

An unusual display of Aurora Borealis was observed. It appeared 
first, at about 8:15 p.m., as a somewhat indistinct patch of light 
roughly elliptical in shape extending in a general east-west 
direction, south of the zenith at an elevation of about thirty 
degrees. Display continued through midnight and reached its 
greatest brilliance between 10:00 p.m. and midnight. When observed 
at approximately 10:15 p.m., bands and streamers of auroral light 
were visible in all quadrants, and the streamers seemed to 
converge at a slight distance to the right of the zenith. The 
effect was described by one observer as "an umbrella of tinted 
lights". Pink, green, red and occasionally purple colors were 
observed, and during some periods the coloring was distinct. 
Streamers exhibited the customary pulsations, accompanied by light 
waves passing overhead very rapidly from north to south.
