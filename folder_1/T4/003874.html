<title>ATSDR - MMG: Arsenic Trioxide</title>
<meta name="description" content="There are many forms of arsenic, but this medical Management Guideline focuses specifically on arsenic trioxide (As2O3), one of the most toxic and prevalent forms. Arsenic trioxide is a white or transparent solid in the form of glassy, shapeless lumps or a crystalline powder that resembles sugar. It has no odor or taste. It forms readily when elemental metallic arsenic is heated to high temperatures or burned. When arsenic trioxide is burned, it releases toxic fumes and arsine gas which is highly toxic. Synonyms include arsenic oxide, arsenious acid, arsenious oxide, arsenious trioxide, arsenous acid anhydride, crude arsenic, arsenolite, and white arsenic.">

<h4>Description</h4>

                  <p>There are many forms of arsenic, but 
                    this medical Management Guideline focuses specifically on 
                    arsenic trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), one of the 
                    most toxic and prevalent forms. Arsenic trioxide is a white 
                    or transparent solid in the form of glassy, shapeless lumps 
                    or a crystalline powder that resembles sugar. It has no odor 
                    or taste. It forms readily when elemental metallic arsenic 
                    is heated to high temperatures or burned. When arsenic trioxide 
                    is burned, it releases toxic fumes and arsine gas which is 
                    highly toxic. </p>
                    
<h4>Routes of Exposure</h4>
<h5>Inhalation</h5>
                  <p>Arsenic trioxide dust is readily absorbed 
                    from the lungs, but inhaled quantities are usually insufficient 
                    to cause acute systemic toxicity. Arsenic trioxide has no 
                    odor. Thus, odor provides no warning of hazardous airborne 
                    concentrations.</p>
                
<h5>Skin/Eye Contact</h5>
                  <p>Direct contact with arsenic trioxide 
                    dust can cause localized skin irritation, but systemic absorption 
                    through the skin is negligible. Skin contact is unlikely to 
                    cause systemic effects unless the dermal barrier is compromised. 
                    Arsenic trioxide dust is irritating to the eyes.</p>

<h5>Ingestion</h5>
                  <p>Ingestion is the most important route 
                    of acute exposure of arsenic trioxide. Ingested arsenic trioxide 
                    is quickly absorbed and can be extremely hazardous. Significant 
                    tissue and organ damage and death may result. Most acute intoxications 
                    are from suicidal or homicidal ingestion. </p>
                    
<h4>Sources/Uses</h4>
                  <p>Arsenic is ubiquitous in the natural 
                    environment. Arsenic trioxide is one of the arsenites (inorganic 
                    forms of arsenic in the trivalent state [As<sup>3+</sup>]), 
                    found in nature and is produced mainly from by-products of 
                    copper smelting. It is no longer commercially manufactured 
                    in the United States, but is imported primarily for use in 
                    manufacturing other arsenic compounds used as wood preservatives, 
                    insecticides, and herbicides. It is also used in metallurgical 
                    processes, and in the manufacturing of glass and ceramics. 
                    Arsenic compounds were formerly used medicinally in humans 
                    (e.g., Fowler's solution), but these uses have largely been 
                    abandoned. Inorganic arsenic compounds, however, can be found 
                    in some homeopathic and folk remedies.</p>

<h4>Standards and Guidelines</h4>
                  <p>OSHA PEL (permissible exposure limit) 
                    = 10 &#956;g/m&sup3; (averaged over an 8-hour workshift) for 
                    inorganic arsenic compounds.</p>
                  <p>NIOSH IDLH (immediately dangerous to 
                    life or health) = 5 mg As/m&sup3; (for all inorganic arsenic 
                    compounds).</p>

<h4>Physical Properties</h4>
                  <p><i>Description</i>: white or transparent 
                    solid in the form of glassy, shapeless lumps or a crystalline 
                    powder that resembles sugar.</p>
                  <p> <i>Warning properties</i>: inadequate; 
                    odorless and tasteless; airborne arsenic trioxide may produce 
                    a burning sensation to the nose, mouth, and eyes and cause 
                    coughing, shortness of breath, headache, sore throat, and 
                    dizziness. </p>

                    in water (37 g/L at 20&#186;C, 115 g/L at 100&#186;C); slightly 
                    soluble in alcohol; soluble in dilute HCl solutions.</p>
                  <p><i>Flammability</i>: not flammable, but 
                    emits highly toxic arsine gas and oxides of arsenic fumes 
                    when burned.</p>
                    
<h4>Incompatibilities</h4>
                  <p>Flammable reactions can occur in the 
                    presence of strong oxidizers. If arsenic trioxide is exposed 
                    to hydrogen gas or to the combination of acid (acid fumes) 
                    or water and active metals, the reaction can form toxic arsine 
                    gas (see <i>Medical Management Guideline for Arsine</i>).</p>

<a name="bookmark02"></a><h3>Health Effects</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Toxic effects of arsenic trioxide usually result from 
                      ingestion. Small amounts of arsenic trioxide can lead to 
                      multiple organ damage and death. Acute signs and symptoms 
                      include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 
                      cerebral edema, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and hypovolemic 
                      shock. Symptoms are dose dependent and can be delayed.</li>
                    <li>Dermal contact and inhalation of airborne arsenic trioxide 
                      can cause localized irritation and usually does not result 
                      in systemic effects.<br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  
<h4>Acute Exposure</h4>
              
                  <p>The toxic effects caused by acute exposure 
                    to arsenic trioxide are due in large part to its ability to 
                    bind to cellular proteins containing sulfhydryl groups. This 
                    inhibits the production of energy needed to maintain tissue 
                    functions, and results in a decrease in glutathione, which 
                    is necessary for the metabolic detoxification of arsenic. 
                    The primary target organs are the gastrointestinal tract, 
                    heart, brain and kidney. Eventually the skin, bone marrow 
                    and peripheral nervous system are also affected. Arsenic trioxide 
                    has direct toxic effects on endothelial cells, increasing 
                    the permeability of small blood vessels.</p>
                  <p>Children do not always respond to chemicals 
                    in the same way that adults do. Different protocols for managing 
                    their care may be needed.</p>
                  <p> This medical management guide focuses 
                    specifically on arsenic trioxide (an arsenite), which is one 
                    of the most toxic forms of arsenic. As little as 1 to 2.5 
                    mg/kg of arsenic trioxide is a potentially fatal dose. Toxicity 
                    from natural sources of arsenic is rare except from drinking 
                    highly contaminated groundwater or from breathing highly contaminated 
                    air (e.g., from burning of arsenic-containing coal indoors 
                    without adequate ventilation). Other inorganic forms of arsenic 
                    called arsenates are in the pentavalent state (As<sup>5+</sup>) 
                    and are several times less toxic than the arsenites. Elemental 
                    arsenic has a gray metal-like appearance, is insoluble in 
                    water or body fluids, and is not considered poisonous. Organic 
                    arsenic, also known as fish or seaweed arsenic (arsenocholine, 
                    arsenobetaine, or arsenosugars) is mostly found in seafood 
                    such as bivalves, bottom-feeding fish, and seaweed and has 
                    a lower toxicity.</p>

                  <p> Initial symptoms occurring within 30 
                    minutes to several hours include burning of the lips, pharyngeal 
                    constriction, severe abdominal pain and nausea. A metallic 
                    or garlic taste and intense thirst also occur. Inflammation 
                    and necrosis of the mucosa and submucosa can lead to bloody 
                    or &quot;rice water&quot; diarrhea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal 
                    perforation and bleeding. Bleeding and/or fluid loss can result 
                    in electrolyte abnormalities, shock, and death. </p>

<h5>CNS</h5>

                  <p>Encephalopathy (cerebral edema), headache, 
                    lethargy, delirium, hallucinations, seizures, or coma can 
                    occur. Cerebral lesions consisting of multiple, symmetrical 
                    foci of hemorrhagic necrosis occur in the gray and white matter. 
                  </p>
					
<h5>Peripheral Neurologic</h5>

                  <p> Peripheral neuropathy resembling Guillain-Barr&eacute; 
                    syndrome (ascending flaccid paralysis) is common acutely or 
                    subacutely. Sensory symptoms predominate early, with patients 
                    complaining of &quot;pins and needles&quot; or electrical 
                    shock like pains in the lower extremities. This may be followed 
                    by numbness and motor weakness.</p>
                
<h5>Cardiovascular</h5>
              
                  <p>Increased capillary permeability (third-spacing 
                    and vasodilation) can result in hypovolemic shock. Sinus tachycardia 
                    can be an early sign of poisoning. Polymorphous ventricular 
                    tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and congestive heart 
                    failure can occur. Electrocardiographic findings can include, 
                    prolongation of the QT interval, ST depression, and flattened 
                    T waves.</p>
					
<h5>Respiratory</h5>
                  <p>Pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress 
                    syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure due to weakness of 
                    the respiratory muscles can occur following ingestion. Coughing, 
                    chest pain, dyspnea, and general irritation of the upper respiratory 
                    tract can occur following inhalation.</p>
                  <p> Exposure to certain chemicals can lead 
                    to Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS), a chemically- 
                    or irritant-induced type of asthma.</p>
                  <p> Children may be more vulnerable because 
                    of relatively increased minute ventilation per kg and failure 
                    to evacuate an area promptly when exposed.</p>

<h5>Musculoskeletal</h5>
                  <p>Myalgia, weakness, muscular atrophy and 
                    rhabdomyolysis can occur.</p>
                    
<h5>Renal</h5>
                  <p>Initial glomerular damage leading to 
                    proteinuria is common following high arsenic exposure. Tubular 
                    necrosis and degeneration, oliguria with proteinuria, hematuria 
                    and acute renal failure are also frequently observed. </p>
                    
<h5>Hepatic</h5>
                  <p> Hepatocellular injury after acute exposure 
                    to inorganic arsenicals is uncommon, but fatty infiltration 
                    of the liver, central necrosis, and cirrhosis may occur. Hepatitis 
                    may also develop due to altered intrahepatic heme metabolism, 
                    increased synthesis of bilirubin, and altered interhepatocyte 
                    protein transport.</p>
                    
<h5>Dermal</h5>
                  <p>Flushing, diaphoresis, edema (especially 
                    periorbital), hyperkeratosis, and brawny desquamation or exfoliative 
                    dermatitis can occur.</p>                
                    
<h5>Ocular</h5>
                  <p>Conjunctivitis, photophobia, and dimness 
                    of vision, diplopia, and lacrimation can occur.</p>        
                    
<h5>Potential Sequelae</h5>
                  <p>If the immediate effects of acute arsenic 
                    poisoning are survived, a variety of delayed effects, including 
                    peripheral neuropathy and bone marrow suppression (anemia, 
                    leukopenia, pancytopenia), may develop. New or persistent 
                    encephalopathy, dysrhythmias, and nail changes (Mee's lines) 
                    can also occur. Peripheral neuropathy involves sensory and 
                    motor neurons in a stocking-glove distribution. Initially 
                    painful dysesthesias (i.e., &quot;pins and needles&quot; or 
                    an electric shock-like sensation) are prominent. Early treatment 
                    with the chelator dimercaprol, also known as BAL (British 
                    AntiLewisite), may not eliminate the risk of delayed effects. 
                    Survival of the acute phase of arsenic poisoning is highly 
                    dependent on the dose received and the timing and extent of 
                    treatment. Recovery from subsequent peripheral neuropathy 
                    is usually only partial and may require months to years.</p>              
					
<h3>Chronic Exposure</h3>
                  <p>Chronic exposure is characterized by 
                    malaise, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, anemia, jaundice, 
                    gastrointestinal complaints, and characteristic skin lesions 
                    including hyperkeratosis (small corn-like elevations) and 
                    hyperpigmentation. Hyperkeratosis usually appears on the palms 
                    or soles. Pigmentation changes and hyperkeratosis can take 
                    3 to 7 years to appear. Chronic inhalation can also lead to 
                    conjunctivitis, irritation of the throat and respiratory tract, 
                    and perforation of the nasal septum. Chronic exposure can 
                    cause allergic contact dermatitis. Chronic exposure may be 
                    more serious for children because of their potential longer 
                    latency period.</p>          

<h5>Carcinogenicity</h5>
                  <p>The Department of Health and Human Services 
                    (DHHS), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 
                    the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National 
                    Toxicology Program (NTP) have classified arsenic as a human 
                    carcinogen based on sufficient evidence from human data. Arsenic 
                    trioxide causes skin and lung cancer, and may cause internal 
                    cancers such as liver, bladder, kidney, colon, and prostate 
                    cancers.</p>
                
<h4>Reproductive and Developmental Effects</h4> 
                  <p>Arsenic ions released from arsenic trioxide 
                    within the body can cross the placenta and affect the developing 
                    fetus; arsenic is also excreted in breast milk. Experimental 
                    animal studies support an association between high ingested 
                    arsenic dose and fetal toxicity. Arsenic trioxide is not included 
                    in <i>Reproductive and Developmental Toxicants</i>, a 1991 
                    report published by the General Accounting Office (GAO) that 
                    lists 30 chemicals of concern because of widely acknowledged 
                    reproductive and developmental consequences.</p>
                  <p> Special consideration regarding the 
                    exposure of pregnant women may be warranted, since arsenic 
                    trioxide has been shown to be mutagenic and clastogenic, and 
                    is suspected of being teratogenic; thus, medical counseling 
                    is recommended for the acutely exposed pregnant woman.</p>

<a name="bookmark03"></a> <h3>Prehospital Management</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Exposed persons whose skin or clothing is contaminated 
                      with arsenic trioxide can contaminate rescuers by direct 
                      contact or through release of inhalable dust.</li>
                    <li>There is no serious risk of secondary contamination after 
                      clothing is removed and the skin is washed.</li>
                    <li>Arsenic trioxide is irritating to the skin, eyes, and 
                      respiratory tract. Systemic effects can occur from all routes 
                      of exposure and may include severe gastrointestinal injury, 
                      life-threatening shock, and nerve damage.</li>
                    <li>There is no specific antidote for arsenic trioxide. Prehospital 
                      treatment consists of supportive care and gastric decontamination. 
                      Chelation therapy is strongly recommended<br>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                        
<h4>Hot Zone</h4>
                  <p>Rescuers should be trained and appropriately 
                    attired before entering the Hot Zone. If the proper equipment 
                    is not available, or if the rescuers have not been trained 
                    in its use, call for assistance from a local or regional HAZMAT 
                    team or other properly equipped response organization.</p>
                    
<h5>Rescuer Protection</h5>
                  <p>Arsenic trioxide dust is readily absorbed 
                    through inhalation and can irritate the respiratory tract. 
                    Although it is poorly absorbed dermally, skin contact should 
                    be avoided because arsenic trioxide can irritate the skin.</p>
                  <p><i>Respiratory Protection</i>: Positive-pressure, 
                    self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is recommended in 
                    response situations that involve exposure to potentially unsafe 
                    levels of arsenic trioxide or combustion products (arsine 
                    and arsenic trioxide fumes).</p>
                  <p> <i>Skin Protection</i>: Chemical-protective 
                    clothing is recommended when contact with arsenic trioxide 
                    is expected because skin irritation might occur.</p>

<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
                  <p>Quickly access for a patent airway, ensure 
                    adequate respiration and pulse. If trauma is suspected, manually 
                    maintain cervical immobilization and apply a cervical collar 
                    and a backboard when feasible. Apply direct pressure to stop 
                    any heavy bleeding. Maintain adequate circulation.</p>

<h5>Victim Removal</h5>
                  <p>If victims can walk, lead them out of 
                    the Hot Zone to the Decontamination Zone. Victims who are 
                    unable to walk should be removed on backboards or gurneys. 
                    If these are not available, carefully carry or drag victims 
                    to safety.</p>
                  <p> Consider appropriate management of chemically 
                    contaminated children, anticipate separation anxiety if a 
                    child is separated from a parent or other adult.</p>

<h4>Decontamination Zone</h4>
                  <p>All victims exposed to arsenic trioxide 
                    require decontamination (see <i>Basic Decontamination</i>, 
                    below).</p>

<p><b>Rescuer Protection</b></p>
                 <p>If exposure levels are determined to 
                    be safe, decontamination may be conducted by personnel wearing 
                    a lower level of protection than that required in the Hot 
                    Zone (described above).</p>

<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
                  <p>Quickly access for a patent airway, ensure 
                    adequate respiration and pulse. Maintain adequate circulation. 
                    If trauma is suspected, manually maintain cervical immobilization 
                    and apply a cervical collar and a backboard when feasible. 
                    Administer supplemental oxygen as required. Assist ventilation 
                    with a bag-valve-mask device if necessary. Apply direct pressure 
                    to control any bleeding.</p>

<h5>Basic Decontamination</h5>
                  <p>Victims who are able may assist with 
                    their own decontamination. Remove and double-bag contaminated 
                    clothing and all personal belongings.</p>
                  <p>Wash exposed skin and hair with mild 
                    soap and water (preferably under a shower). Rinse thoroughly 
                    with water. Use caution to avoid hypothermia when decontaminating 
                    children or the elderly. Use blankets or warmers when appropriate.</p>
                  <p>Flush exposed or irritated eyes with 
                    plain water or saline for at least <b>15 minutes</b>. Remove 
                    contact lenses if easily removable without additional trauma 
                    to the eye. If pain or injury is evident, continue irrigation 
                    while transferring the victim to the Support Zone.</p>
                  <p> In cases of ingestion, <b>do not induce 
                    emesis</b>. Aggressive decontamination with gastric lavage 
                    is recommended within 1 hour of ingestion of a life-threatening 
                    amount of poison. The effectiveness of activated charcoal 
                    in binding arsenic trioxide is questionable, but administration 
                    of a charcoal slurry is recommended pending further evaluation 
                    in cases of ingestion of unknown quantities (at 1 gm/kg, usual 
                    adult dose 60-90 g, child dose 25-50 g). A soda can and straw 
                    may be of assistance when offering charcoal to a child. </p>
                  <p> Consider appropriate management of chemically 
                    contaminated children at the exposure site. Also, provide 
                    reassurance to the child during decontamination, especially 
                    if separation from a parent occurs. If possible, seek assistance 
                    from a child separation expert.</p>

<h5>Transfer to Support Zone</h5>
                  <p>As soon as basic decontamination is complete, 
                    move the victim to the Support Zone.</p>

<h4>Support Zone</h4>
                  <p>Be certain that victims have been decontaminated 
                    properly (see <i>Decontamination Zone</i>, above). Victims 
                    who have undergone decontamination pose no serious risk of 
                    secondary contamination to rescuers. In such cases, Support 
                    Zone personnel require no specialized protective gear.</p>

<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
                  <p>Quickly access for a patent airway, ensure 
                    adequate respiration and pulse. If trauma is suspected, manually 
                    maintain cervical immobilization and apply a cervical collar 
                    and a backboard when feasible. Administer supplemental oxygen 
                    as required. Assist ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device, 
                    if necessary. Maintain adequate circulation. Apply direct 
                    pressure to control any bleeding. Establish intravenous access, 
                    if necessary. Place on a cardiac monitor.</p>
                  <p>If evidence of shock or hypotension is 
                    observed begin fluid administration. For adults, bolus 1,000 
                    mL/hour if blood pressure is under 80 mm Hg; if systolic pressure 
                    is over 90 mm Hg, an infusion rate of 150 to 200 mL/hour is 
                    sufficient. For children with compromised perfusion administer 
                    a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over 10 to 20 minutes, then 
                    infuse at 2 to 3 mL/kg/hour.</p>

<h5>Additional Decontamination</h5>
                  <p>Continue irrigating exposed skin and 
                    eyes, as appropriate. In cases of ingestion, <b>do not induce 
                    emesis</b>. Aggressive decontamination with gastric lavage 
                    is recommended within 1 hour of ingestion of a life-threatening 
                    amount of poison. The effectiveness of activated charcoal 
                    in binding arsenic trioxide is questionable, but administration 
                    of a charcoal slurry is recommended pending further evaluation 
                    in cases of ingestion of unknown quantities (at 1 gm/kg, usual 
                    adult dose 60-90 g, child dose 25-50 g). A soda can and straw 
                    may be of assistance when offering charcoal to a child.</p>

<h5>Advanced Treatment</h5>
                 <p> In cases of respiratory compromise secure 
                    airway and respiration via endotracheal intubation. If not 
                    possible, perform cricothyroidotomy if equipped and trained 
                    to do so.</p>
                  <p> Treat patients who have bronchospasm 
                    with aerosolized bronchodilators. The use of bronchial sensitizing 
                    agents in situations of multiple chemical exposures may pose 
                    additional risks. Also consider the health of the myocardium 
                    before choosing which type of bronchodilator should be administered. 
                    Cardiac sensitizing agents may be appropriate; however, the 
                    use of cardiac sensitizing agents after exposure to certain 
                    chemicals may pose enhanced risk of cardiac arrhythmias (especially 
                    in the elderly). Arsenic trioxide poisoning is not known to 
                    pose additional risk during the use of bronchial or cardiac 
                    sensitizing agents. </p>
                  <p> Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed cautioning for myocardial variability.</p>
                  <p>Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or have seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias should be treated 
                    according to advanced life support (ALS) protocols.</p>
                  <p> If massive exposure is suspected or 
                    if the patient is hypotensive, infuse intravenous saline or 
                    lactated Ringer's solution. For adults, bolus 1,000 mL/hour 
                    if blood pressure is under 80 mm Hg; if systolic pressure 
                    is over 90 mm Hg, an infusion rate of 150 to 200 mL/hour is 
                    sufficient. For children with compromised perfusion administer 
                    a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over 10 to 20 minutes, then 
                    infuse at 2 to 3 mL/kg/hour.</p>
                   
<h5>Transport to Medical Facility</h5>
                  <p>Only decontaminated patients or patients 
                    not requiring decontamination should be transported to a medical 
                    facility. &quot;Body bags&quot; are not recommended.</p>
                  <p> Report to the base station and the receiving 
                    medical facility the condition of the patient, treatment given, 
                    and estimated time of arrival at the medical facility.</p>
                  <p> If the patient has ingested arsenic 
                    trioxide, prepare the ambulance in case the patient vomits 
                    toxic material or has diarrhea. Have ready several towels 
                    and open plastic bags to quickly clean up and isolate vomitus.</p>                 

<h4>Multi-Casualty Triage</h4>
                  <p>Consult with the base station physician 
                    or the regional poison control center for advice regarding 
                    triage of multiple victims.</p>
                  <p>Patients with evidence of significant 
                    exposure and all patients who have ingested arsenic trioxide 
                    should be transported to a medical facility for evaluation.</p>
                  <p>Asymptomatic patients who have not had 
                    direct exposure to arsenic trioxide may be discharged from 
                    the scene, after their names, addresses, and telephone numbers 
                    are recorded. These patients should be advised to seek medical 
                    care promptly if symptoms develop (see <i>Patient Information 
                    Sheet</i> below).</p>

<a name="bookmark04"></a> <h3>Emergency Department Management</h3> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Patients whose skin or clothing is contaminated with arsenic 
                      trioxide can contaminate rescuers by direct contact or through 
                      release of inhalable dust.</li>
                    <li>Patients do not pose a serious risk of secondary contamination 
                      after their clothing is removed and their skin is washed.</li>
                    <li>Arsenic trioxide is irritating to the skin, eyes, and 
                      respiratory tract. Systemic effects can occur from all routes 
                      of exposure and may include gastrointestinal injury, life-threatening 
                      shock, and nerve damage.</li>
                    <li>There is no specific antidote for arsenic trioxide. Treatment 
                      consists of supportive care and gastric decontamination. 
                      Chelation therapy is strongly recommended.</li>
                  </ul>
                
<h4>Decontamination Area</h4>
                  <p>Previously decontaminated patients may 
                    be transferred directly to the Critical Care Area. Others 
                    require decontamination as described below. Because arsenic 
                    trioxide can irritate the skin, thus increasing the probability 
                    of dermal absorption, chemical-protective clothing is recommended 
                    when contact with arsenic trioxide is expected.</p>
                  <p> Be aware that use of protective equipment 
                    by the provider may cause fear in children, resulting in decreased 
                    compliance with further management efforts.</p>
                  <p> Because of their relatively larger surface 
                    area:weight ratio, children are more vulnerable to toxicants 
                    absorbed through the skin. Also, emergency room personnel 
                    should examine children's mouths because of the frequency 
                    of hand-to-mouth activity among children.</p>
                
<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
                  <p>Evaluate and support the airway, breathing, 
                    and circulation. Secure airway and respiration via endotracheal 
                    intubation. If not possible, perform cricothyroidotomy if 
                    equipped and trained to do so.</p>
                  <p> Treat patients who have bronchospasm 
                    with aerosolized bronchodilators. The use of bronchial sensitizing 
                    agents in situations of multiple chemical exposures may pose 
                    additional risks. Also consider the health of the myocardium 
                    before choosing which type of bronchodilator should be administered. 
                    Cardiac sensitizing agents may be appropriate; however, the 
                    use of cardiac sensitizing agents after exposure to certain 
                    chemicals may pose enhanced risk of cardiac arrhythmias (especially 
                    in the elderly). Arsenic trioxide poisoning is not known to 
                    pose additional risk during the use of bronchial or cardiac 
                    sensitizing agents. </p>
                  <p> Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed cautioning for myocardial variability.</p>
                  <p>Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or have seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias should be treated 
                    in the conventional manner.</p>

<h5>Basic Decontamination</h5>
                  <p>Patients who are able and cooperative 
                    may assist with their own decontamination. Remove and double-bag 
                    contaminated clothing and all personal belongings.</p>
                  <p>Wash exposed skin and hair with mild 
                    soap and water (preferably under a shower). Rinse thoroughly 
                    with water.</p>
                  <p>Flush exposed or irritated eyes with 
                    plain water or saline for at least <b>15 minutes</b>. Remove 
                    contact lenses if present and easily removable without additional 
                    trauma to the eye. If ocular pain or injury is evident, continue 
                    irrigation while transferring the victim to the Critical Care 
                    Area.</p>
                  <p>In cases of ingestion, <b>do not induce 
                    emesis</b>. Consider gastric lavage for recent large ingestion. 
                    (More information is provided in <i>Ingestion Exposure</i> 
                    under <i>Critical Care Area </i>below).</p>

<h4>Critical Care Area</h4>
                  <p>Be certain that appropriate decontamination 
                    has been carried out (see <i>Decontamination Area</i> above).</p>

<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
                  <p>Evaluate and support the airway, breathing, 
                    and circulation as in ABC Reminders above. Children may be 
                    more vulnerable to corrosive agents than adults because of 
                    the relatively smaller diameter of their airways. Establish 
                    intravenous access in symptomatic patients. Continuously monitor 
                    cardiac rhythm.</p>
                  <p> Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or have seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias should be treated 
                    in the conventional manner. </p>

<h5>Inhalation Exposure</h5>
                  <p>Administer supplemental oxygen by mask 
                    to patients who have respiratory complaints. For serious exposure, 
                    respiratory tract irritation can progress to pulmonary edema, 
                    maintain adequate oxygenation and provide mechanical support 
                    if needed. Treat patients who have bronchospasm with aerosolized 
                    bronchodilators. The use of bronchial sensitizing agents in 
                    situations of multiple chemical exposures may pose additional 
                    risks. Also consider the health of the myocardium before choosing 
                    which type of bronchodilator should be administered. Dopamine 
                    or norepinephrine may be appropriate in management of shock; 
                    however, the use of cardiac sensitizing agents after exposure 
                    to certain chemicals may pose enhanced risk of cardiac arrhythmias 
                    (especially in the elderly). Arsenic trioxide poisoning is 
                    not known to pose additional risk during the use of bronchial 
                    or cardiac sensitizing agents. </p>
                  <p> Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed cautioning for myocardial variability.</p>

<h5>Skin Exposure</h5>
                  <p>Dermal exposure to arsenic trioxide may 
                    cause skin irritation. Treat symptomatically.</p>

<h5>Eye Exposure</h5>
                  <p>Ensure that adequate eye irrigation has 
                    been completed. Test visual acuity. Examine the eyes for corneal 
                    damage and treat appropriately. Consult an ophthalmologist 
                    for patients who have apparent or suspected corneal injury.</p>

<h5>Ingestion Exposure</h5>              
                 <p>Fluid repletion should begin as soon 
                    as possible in severe acute poisoning. Central venous or pulmonary 
                    wedge pressure monitoring can be useful in managing severe 
                    exposures where hypotension is a risk.</p>
                  <p><b>Do not induce emesis</b>. In case 
                    of recent ingestion (less than 1 hour), and if spontaneous 
                    emesis has not occurred, consider performing gastric lavage 
                    to prevent further absorption. Insert an orogastric tube and 
                    begin lavage with water or normal saline as soon as possible. 
                    Continue lavage until the return is clear. Activated charcoal 
                    may not bind significant amounts but is recommended (at 1 
                    gm/kg, usual adult dose 60-90 g, child dose 25-50 g).</p>
                  <p>Arsenic is radiopaque and an abdominal 
                    radiograph should be obtained in cases of ingestion. If opacities 
                    compatible with arsenic are noted on the radiograph, consider 
                    whole bowel irrigation (e.g., with a polyethylene glycol [PEG-3350] 
                    electrolyte lavage solution).</p>
                  <p>Consider alkalization of urine (pH 7.5) 
                    to protect kidney from deposition of red cell breakdown products. 
                    Assure adequate renal function before administering sodium 
                    bicarbonate. </p>

<h5>Antidotes and Other Treatments</h5>
                  <p>Chelation therapy curtails the distribution 
                    of arsenic in the bodyand reduces the body burden. The decision 
                    to chelate for a patient should be made only by professionals 
                    experienced in the use of chelation, preferably in consultation 
                    with a regional poison control center or a medical toxicologist. 
                    Patients with a clear history of exposure to arsenic with 
                    significant GI and/or cardiovascular symptoms may require 
                    chelation before laboratory confirmation. As time increases 
                    after exposure, chelation therapy becomes less effective in 
                    reducing the severity of poisoning and in reducing the risks 
                    of serious delayed effects. Do not chelate asymptomatic patients 
                    without the guidance of a 24-hour urinary arsenic level.</p>
                  <p>In acutely ill patients, the agent most 
                    frequently recommended is dimercaprol, also known as BAL (British 
                    AntiLewisite). The standard dosage regimen is 3 to 5 mg/kg 
                    IM every 4-6 hours until the 24-hour urinary arsenic level 
                    falls below 50 &#956;g/L, unless an orally administered chelating 
                    agent (e.g., DMSA, see below) is substituted. This regimen 
                    may be adjusted depending upon the severity of the exposure 
                    and the symptoms.</p>
                  <p><b>Contraindications to BAL include preexisting 
                    renal disease, pregnancy (except in life-threatening circumstances) 
                    and concurrent use of medicinal iron (BAL and iron together 
                    form a complex that is very toxic).</b></p>
                  <p>An increased risk for hemolysis should 
                    also be considered when administering BAL to patients with 
                    glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; arsenic trioxide 
                    is itself an inhibitor of G-6-PD.</p>
                  <p>Chelation therapy should be continued 
                    until the 24-hour urinary arsenic level falls below 50 &#956;g/L. 
                    Alkalization of the urine stabilizes the dimercaprol-metal 
                    complex and has been proposed to protect the kidneys during 
                    chelation therapy. If any degree of acute renal insufficiency 
                    develops during chelation, hemodialysis should be considered 
                    to remove the dimercaprol-arsenic complex. Side effects of 
                    BAL administered at 2.5 mg/kg are mostly pain at the injection 
                    site. At an intramuscular dose of 5 mg/kg, the effects can 
                    include hypertension, nausea, vomiting, headache, lacrimation, 
                    rhinorrhea, salivation, and diaphoresis.</p>
                  <p>Oral agents such as 2,3-demercaptosuccinic 
                    acid (DMSA or Succimer&reg;) or D-penicillamine have been 
                    used as alternatives to BAL. DMSA is approved for the treatment 
                    of pediatric lead poisoning in the United States; it also 
                    has been used successfully to chelate arsenic in humans, and 
                    is being further evaluated for this use. Water-soluble chelating 
                    agents like DMSA are less toxic than BAL and are often substituted 
                    when the patient's condition improves. DMSA might also be 
                    preferable for patients with renal insufficiency, but GI motility 
                    is a prerequisite, as well as GI decontamination (to prevent 
                    increased arsenic absorption).</p>
                  <p>The use of D-penicillamine as an oral 
                    chelating agent is controversial. It has been used successfully 
                    in children, but should be avoided in penicillin allergic 
                    patients.</p>
                
<h5>Laboratory Tests</h5>
                  <p>Routine laboratory studies for seriously 
                    exposed patients include CBC, serum electrolytes, urinalysis 
                    and liver enzyme and kidney function tests. Chest radiographs 
                    and pulse oximetry (or ABG measurements) are recommended for 
                    patients who have respiratory symptoms. An abdominal radiograph 
                    can detect radiopaque ingested arsenic. Additionally, 24-hour 
                    urine arsenic levels are useful for monitoring symptomatic 
                    patients. A chelated or non-chelated level above 100 &#956;g 
                    is usually considered abnormal. Normal total urinary arsenic 
                    levels are less than 50 &#956;g/L in the absence of recent 
                    consumption of seafood that contains organic forms of arsenic 
                    (i.e., fish arsenic).</p>
                  <p>A high blood arsenic level (normal being 
                    less than 7 &#956;g/100 mL) might confirm a diagnosis of poisoning. 
                    However, arsenic moves quickly out of the bloodstream (its 
                    initial half-life in blood is 1 to 2 hours) and a normal value 
                    does not exclude poisoning. If the blood arsenic level is 
                    normal, but the 24-hour urinary arsenic excretion is elevated, 
                    and there is a compatible clinical presentation, the diagnosis 
                    can still be made.</p>
                  <p><b>Note</b>: If the patient has eaten 
                    seafood containing organic arsenic (fish arsenic) within the 
                    past 48 hours, total urinary arsenic might be significantly 
                    elevated (urinary arsenic of up to 1,700 &#956;g/L has been 
                    measured following a large shellfish meal). Some laboratories 
                    can speciate arsenic into the nontoxic organic arsenics found 
                    in seafood and the toxic inorganic forms, although results 
                    are often not quickly available.</p>

<h4>Disposition and Follow-up</h4>
                  <p>Hospitalize patients who have ingested 
                    a significant amount of arsenic trioxide, those who have had 
                    significant inhalation exposure, and those who require chelation 
                    therapy.</p>
                    
                    
<h4>Delayed Effects</h4>
                  <p>Delayed effects can occur after an acute 
                    arsenic exposure that resulted in significant acute effects. 
                    Delayed effects include peripheral neuropathy, bone marrow 
                    suppression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia), encephalophathy, 
                    cardiomyopathy, and dermatologic lesions. Although timely 
                    chelation therapy reduces the occurrence of delayed effects, 
                    follow-up should include particular attention to these organ 
                    systems.</p>  

<h5>Patient Release</h5>
                  <p>Asymptomatic patients who have minimal 
                    exposure, normal initial examinations, and no signs of toxicity 
                    after 6 to 8 hours of observation may be discharged with instructions 
                    to seek medical attention promptly if symptoms develop (see 
                    the <i>Arsenic Trioxide-Patient Information Sheet</i> below).</p>

<h5>Follow-up</h5>
                  <p>Obtain the name of the patient's primary 
                    care physician so that the hospital can send a copy of the 
                    ED visit to the patient's doctor.</p>
                  <p> Patients who remain asymptomatic after 
                    exposure require no follow-up. Discharged patients who had 
                    relatively minor or transient symptoms following an ingestion 
                    exposure should initiate a 24-hour urine collection for arsenic 
                    measurement. Follow-up should include evaluation of urinary 
                    arsenic levels, and consultation with the regional poison 
                    center regarding outpatient chelation. For severely exposed 
                    patients with significant symptoms of acute poisoning, follow-up 
                    evaluation of neurologic, circulatory, renal, pulmonary, hematologic, 
                    and hepatic function should be arranged. Patients who have 
                    corneal lesions should be reexamined within 24 hours.</p>

<h4>Reporting</h4>
                  <p>If a work-related incident has occurred, 
                    you may be legally required to file a report; contact your 
                    state or local health department.</p>
                  <p>Other persons may still be at risk in 
                    the setting where this incident occurred. If the incident 
                    occurred in the workplace, discussing it with company personnel 
                    may prevent future incidents. If a public health risk exists, 
                    notify your state or local health department or other responsible 
                    public agency. When appropriate, inform patients that they 
                    may request an evaluation of their workplace form OSHA or 
                    NIOSH. See Appendices III and IV for a list of agencies that 
                    may be of assistance.</p>

                    arsenic trioxide. </p>

                  </p>

<b>What is arsenic 
                  trioxide?</b>
                  <p>Arsenic is an element found naturally 
                    in the environment. There are many arsenic compounds of commercial 
                    importance. One of the most toxic of these is arsenic trioxide. 
                    Arsenic trioxide is a white or transparent solid that has 
                    no taste or odor and low flammability. Arsenic trioxide is 
                    used in the manufacture of wood preservatives, as an insecticide 
                    and herbicide, in metallurgy, and in glass and ceramic manufacturing.</p>

<b>What immediate 
                  health effects can be caused by exposure to arsenic trioxide?</b>
                  <p>Breathing arsenic trioxide can cause 
                    nose and throat irritation, but generally, a person cannot 
                    inhale enough to severely harm internal organs. Skin or eye 
                    contact can cause irritation.</p>
                  <p>Intentional or unintentional swallowing 
                    of even a tiny amount of arsenic trioxide can cause severe 
                    vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and shock, as well as 
                    seizures; coma; damage to the liver, kidneys, nerves, and 
                    bone marrow; and death.</p>

<b>Can arsenic trioxide 
                  poisoning be treated?</b>
                  <p>Washing arsenical residues from the skin 
                    or eyes usually reduces the irritant effect. If arsenic trioxide 
                    is swallowed, measures can be taken to remove it from the 
                    body. In severe cases, medicines called chelating agents are 
                    given to remove arsenic from the body and eliminate it in 
                    the urine. Severely affected individuals must be hospitalized. 
                    In some cases, permanent nerve damage can result even if chelation 
                    therapy is used.</p>

<b>Are any future 
                  health effects likely to occur?</b>              
                  <p>Arsenic trioxide can cause adverse health 
                    effects in the liver, kidney, brain, nervous system, or bone 
                    marrow for months or years after a severe poisoning.</p>

<b>What, tests can be done if a person has been exposed to aniline?</b>
                  <p>Specific blood tests for the presence of methemoglobin may 
					be useful. If a severe exposure has occurred, blood and 
					urine analyses, and other tests may show whether damage has 
					been done to the liver, heart, and brain. Testing is not 
					needed in every case.</p>
                
<b>What tests can 
                  be done if a person is exposed to arsenic trioxide?</b>
                  <p>Blood and urine tests for arsenic can 
                    be done to confirm exposures. In cases of ingestion, arsenic 
                    might show up in the intestines or stomach on x-rays. Arsenic 
                    levels in urine can be monitored to tell when the arsenic 
                    has been eliminated form the body. Monitoring for past or 
                    long-term exposure can be carried out by analysis of arsenic 
                    levels in hair or nails.</p>
                
                
                <b>Where can more 
                  information about arsenic trioxide be found?</b>
                  <p>More information about arsenic trioxide 
                    can be obtained from your regional poison control center; 
                    your state, county, or local health department; the Agency 
                    for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR); your doctor; 
                    or a clinic in your area that specializes in occupational 
                    and environmental health. If the exposure happened at work, 
                    you may wish to discuss it with your employer, the Occupational 
                    Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or the National Institute 
                    for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Ask the person 
                    who gave you this form for help in locating these telephone 
                    numbers.</p>
