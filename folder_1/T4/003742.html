</small>

<p><b>61.052&nbsp; Dissolution of marriage.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;No judgment of dissolution of marriage shall be granted unless one of the following facts appears, which shall be pleaded generally:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage is irretrievably broken.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental incapacity of one of the parties. However, no dissolution shall be allowed unless the party alleged to be incapacitated shall have been adjudged incapacitated according to the provisions of s. 744.331 for a preceding period of at least 3 years. Notice of the proceeding for dissolution shall be served upon one of the nearest blood relatives or guardian of the incapacitated person, and the relative or guardian shall be entitled to appear and to be heard upon the issues. If the incapacitated party has a general guardian other than the party bringing the proceeding, the petition and summons shall be served upon the incapacitated party and the guardian; and the guardian shall defend and protect the interests of the incapacitated party. If the incapacitated party has no guardian other than the party bringing the proceeding, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to defend and protect the interests of the incapacitated party. However, in all dissolutions of marriage granted on the basis of incapacity, the court may require the petitioner to pay alimony pursuant to the provisions of s. 61.08.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the evidence at the hearing, which evidence need not be corroborated except to establish that the residence requirements of s. 61.021 are met which may be corroborated by a valid Florida driver's license, a Florida voter's registration card, a valid Florida identification card issued under s. 322.051, or the testimony or affidavit of a third party, the court shall dispose of the petition for dissolution of marriage when the petition is based on the allegation that the marriage is irretrievably broken as follows:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no minor child of the marriage and if the responding party does not, by answer to the petition for dissolution, deny that the marriage is irretrievably broken, the court shall enter a judgment of dissolution of the marriage if the court finds that the marriage is irretrievably broken.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is a minor child of the marriage, or when the responding party denies by answer to the petition for dissolution that the marriage is irretrievably broken, the court may:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Order either or both parties to consult with a marriage counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, minister, priest, rabbi, or any other person deemed qualified by the court and acceptable to the party or parties ordered to seek consultation; or
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue the proceedings for a reasonable length of time not to exceed 3 months, to enable the parties themselves to effect a reconciliation; or
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take such other action as may be in the best interest of the parties and the minor child of the marriage.
<br><br>If, at any time, the court finds that the marriage is irretrievably broken, the court shall enter a judgment of dissolution of the marriage. If the court finds that the marriage is not irretrievably broken, it shall deny the petition for dissolution of marriage.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;During any period of continuance, the court may make appropriate orders for the support and alimony of the parties; the parenting plan, support, maintenance, and education of the minor child of the marriage; attorney's fees; and the preservation of the property of the parties.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;A judgment of dissolution of marriage shall result in each spouse having the status of being single and unmarried. No judgment of dissolution of marriage renders the child of the marriage a child born out of wedlock.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may enforce an antenuptial agreement to arbitrate a dispute in accordance with the law and tradition chosen by the parties.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any injunction for protection against domestic violence arising out of the dissolution of marriage proceeding shall be issued as a separate order in compliance with chapter 741 and shall not be included in the judgment of dissolution of marriage.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial pleading for a dissolution of marriage as a separate attachment to the pleading, each party is required to provide his or her social security number and the full names and social security numbers of each of the minor children of the marriage.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, each party is required to provide his or her social security number in accordance with this section. Each party is also required to provide the full name, date of birth, and social security number for each minor child of the marriage. Disclosure of social security numbers obtained through this requirement shall be limited to the purpose of administration of the Title IV-D program for child support enforcement.

<p><b>61.075&nbsp; Equitable distribution of marital assets and liabilities.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, in addition to all other remedies available to a court to do equity between the parties, or in a proceeding for disposition of assets following a dissolution of marriage by a court which lacked jurisdiction over the absent spouse or lacked jurisdiction to dispose of the assets, the court shall set apart to each spouse that spouse's nonmarital assets and liabilities, and in distributing the marital assets and liabilities between the parties, the court must begin with the premise that the distribution should be equal, unless there is a justification for an unequal distribution based on all relevant factors, including:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution to the marriage by each spouse, including contributions to the care and education of the children and services as homemaker.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic circumstances of the parties.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of the marriage.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any interruption of personal careers or educational opportunities of either party.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of one spouse to the personal career or educational opportunity of the other spouse.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The desirability of retaining any asset, including an interest in a business, corporation, or professional practice, intact and free from any claim or interference by the other party.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of each spouse to the acquisition, enhancement, and production of income or the improvement of, or the incurring of liabilities to, both the marital assets and the nonmarital assets of the parties.
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;The desirability of retaining the marital home as a residence for any dependent child of the marriage, or any other party, when it would be equitable to do so, it is in the best interest of the child or that party, and it is financially feasible for the parties to maintain the residence until the child is emancipated or until exclusive possession is otherwise terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction. In making this determination, the court shall first determine if it would be in the best interest of the dependent child to remain in the marital home; and, if not, whether other equities would be served by giving any other party exclusive use and possession of the marital home.
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The intentional dissipation, waste, depletion, or destruction of marital assets after the filing of the petition or within 2 years prior to the filing of the petition.
<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other factors necessary to do equity and justice between the parties.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the court awards a cash payment for the purpose of equitable distribution of marital assets, to be paid in full or in installments, the full amount ordered shall vest when the judgment is awarded and the award shall not terminate upon remarriage or death of either party, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, but shall be treated as a debt owed from the obligor or the obligor's estate to the obligee or the obligee's estate, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;In any contested dissolution action wherein a stipulation and agreement has not been entered and filed, any distribution of marital assets or marital liabilities shall be supported by factual findings in the judgment or order based on competent substantial evidence with reference to the factors enumerated in subsection (1). The distribution of all marital assets and marital liabilities, whether equal or unequal, shall include specific written findings of fact as to the following:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear identification of nonmarital assets and ownership interests;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of marital assets, including the individual valuation of significant assets, and designation of which spouse shall be entitled to each asset;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of the marital liabilities and designation of which spouse shall be responsible for each liability;
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other findings necessary to advise the parties or the reviewing court of the trial court's rationale for the distribution of marital assets and allocation of liabilities.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment distributing assets shall have the effect of a duly executed instrument of conveyance, transfer, release, or acquisition which is recorded in the county where the property is located when the judgment, or a certified copy of the judgment, is recorded in the official records of the county in which the property is located.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the court finds good cause that there should be an interim partial distribution during the pendency of a dissolution action, the court may enter an interim order that shall identify and value the marital and nonmarital assets and liabilities made the subject of the sworn motion, set apart those nonmarital assets and liabilities, and provide for a partial distribution of those marital assets and liabilities. An interim order may be entered at any time after the date the dissolution of marriage is filed and served and before the final distribution of marital and nonmarital assets and marital and nonmarital liabilities.
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an interim order shall be entered only upon good cause shown and upon sworn motion establishing specific factual basis for the motion. The motion may be filed by either party and shall demonstrate good cause why the matter should not be deferred until the final hearing.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court shall specifically take into account and give appropriate credit for any partial distribution of marital assets or liabilities in its final allocation of marital assets or liabilities. Further, the court shall make specific findings in any interim order under this section that any partial distribution will not cause inequity or prejudice to either party as to either party's claims for support or attorney's fees.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any interim order partially distributing marital assets or liabilities as provided in this subsection shall be pursuant to and comport with the factors in subsections (1) and (3) as such factors pertain to the assets or liabilities made the subject of the sworn motion.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this subsection, the term "good cause" means extraordinary circumstances that require an interim partial distribution.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this section:
<p>(a)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marital assets and liabilities" include:
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets acquired and liabilities incurred during the marriage, individually by either spouse or jointly by them.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhancement in value and appreciation of nonmarital assets resulting either from the efforts of either party during the marriage or from the contribution to or expenditure thereon of marital funds or other forms of marital assets, or both.
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interspousal gifts during the marriage.
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;All vested and nonvested benefits, rights, and funds accrued during the marriage in retirement, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, deferred compensation, and insurance plans and programs.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;All real property held by the parties as tenants by the entireties, whether acquired prior to or during the marriage, shall be presumed to be a marital asset. If, in any case, a party makes a claim to the contrary, the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the claim that the subject property, or some portion thereof, is nonmarital.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;All personal property titled jointly by the parties as tenants by the entireties, whether acquired prior to or during the marriage, shall be presumed to be a marital asset. In the event a party makes a claim to the contrary, the burden of proof shall be on the party asserting the claim that the subject property, or some portion thereof, is nonmarital.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of proof to overcome the gift presumption shall be by clear and convincing evidence.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonmarital assets and liabilities" include:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets acquired and liabilities incurred by either party prior to the marriage, and assets acquired and liabilities incurred in exchange for such assets and liabilities;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets acquired separately by either party by noninterspousal gift, bequest, devise, or descent, and assets acquired in exchange for such assets;
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;All income derived from nonmarital assets during the marriage unless the income was treated, used, or relied upon by the parties as a marital asset;
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets and liabilities excluded from marital assets and liabilities by valid written agreement of the parties, and assets acquired and liabilities incurred in exchange for such assets and liabilities; and
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any liability incurred by forgery or unauthorized signature of one spouse signing the name of the other spouse. Any such liability shall be a nonmarital liability only of the party having committed the forgery or having affixed the unauthorized signature. In determining an award of attorney's fees and costs pursuant to s. 61.16, the court may consider forgery or an unauthorized signature by a party and may make a separate award for attorney's fees and costs occasioned by the forgery or unauthorized signature. This subparagraph does not apply to any forged or unauthorized signature that was subsequently ratified by the other spouse.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut-off date for determining assets and liabilities to be identified or classified as marital assets and liabilities is the earliest of the date the parties enter into a valid separation agreement, such other date as may be expressly established by such agreement, or the date of the filing of a petition for dissolution of marriage. The date for determining value of assets and the amount of liabilities identified or classified as marital is the date or dates as the judge determines is just and equitable under the circumstances. Different assets may be valued as of different dates, as, in the judge's discretion, the circumstances require.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;All assets acquired and liabilities incurred by either spouse subsequent to the date of the marriage and not specifically established as nonmarital assets or liabilities are presumed to be marital assets and liabilities. Such presumption is overcome by a showing that the assets and liabilities are nonmarital assets and liabilities. The presumption is only for evidentiary purposes in the dissolution proceeding and does not vest title. Title to disputed assets shall vest only by the judgment of a court. This section does not require the joinder of spouses in the conveyance, transfer, or hypothecation of a spouse's individual property; affect the laws of descent and distribution; or establish community property in this state.
<p>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may provide for equitable distribution of the marital assets and liabilities without regard to alimony for either party. After the determination of an equitable distribution of the marital assets and liabilities, the court shall consider whether a judgment for alimony shall be made.
<p>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;To do equity between the parties, the court may, in lieu of or to supplement, facilitate, or effectuate the equitable division of marital assets and liabilities, order a monetary payment in a lump sum or in installments paid over a fixed period of time.
<p>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;Special equity is abolished. All claims formerly identified as special equity, and all special equity calculations, are abolished and shall be asserted either as a claim for unequal distribution of marital property and resolved by the factors set forth in subsection (1) or as a claim of enhancement in value or appreciation of nonmarital property.

<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether exclusive use and possession of the marital home is being awarded, and the basis for the award;
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether alimony is being awarded to the party in possession and whether the alimony is being awarded to cover, in part or otherwise, the mortgage and taxes and other expenses of and in connection with the marital home;

<p><b>61.079&nbsp; Premarital agreements.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;SHORT TITLE.--This section may be cited as the "Uniform Premarital Agreement Act" and this section applies only to proceedings under the Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS.--As used in this section, the term:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Premarital agreement" means an agreement between prospective spouses made in contemplation of marriage and to be effective upon marriage.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Property" includes, but is not limited to, an interest, present or future, legal or equitable, vested or contingent, in real or personal property, tangible or intangible, including income and earnings, both active and passive.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;FORMALITIES.--A premarital agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. It is enforceable without consideration other than the marriage itself.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTENT.--
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Parties to a premarital agreement may contract with respect to:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights and obligations of each of the parties in any of the property of either or both of them whenever and wherever acquired or located;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to buy, sell, use, transfer, exchange, abandon, lease, consume, expend, assign, create a security interest in, mortgage, encumber, dispose of, or otherwise manage and control property;
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any other event;
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment, modification, waiver, or elimination of spousal support;
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The making of a will, trust, or other arrangement to carry out the provisions of the agreement;
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ownership rights in and disposition of the death benefit from a life insurance policy;
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of law governing the construction of the agreement; and
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other matter, including their personal rights and obligations, not in violation of either the public policy of this state or a law imposing a criminal penalty.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The right of a child to support may not be adversely affected by a premarital agreement.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;EFFECT OF MARRIAGE.--A premarital agreement becomes effective upon marriage of the parties.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;AMENDMENT; REVOCATION OR ABANDONMENT.--After marriage, a premarital agreement may be amended, revoked, or abandoned only by a written agreement signed by the parties. The amended agreement, revocation, or abandonment is enforceable without consideration.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;ENFORCEMENT.--
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;A premarital agreement is not enforceable in an action proceeding under the Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The party did not execute the agreement voluntarily;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement was the product of fraud, duress, coercion, or overreaching; or
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement was unconscionable when it was executed and, before execution of the agreement, that party:
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party;
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, any right to disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party beyond the disclosure provided; and
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge of the property or financial obligations of the other party.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and that modification or elimination causes one party to the agreement to be eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution, a court, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;An issue of unconscionability of a premarital agreement shall be decided by the court as a matter of law.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;ENFORCEMENT; VOID MARRIAGE.--If a marriage is determined to be void, an agreement that would otherwise have been a premarital agreement is enforceable only to the extent necessary to avoid an inequitable result.
<p>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;LIMITATION OF ACTIONS.--Any statute of limitations applicable to an action asserting a claim for relief under a premarital agreement is tolled during the marriage of the parties to the agreement. However, equitable defenses limiting the time for enforcement, including laches and estoppel, are available to either party.
<p>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;APPLICATION TO PROBATE CODE.--This section does not alter the construction, interpretation, or required formalities of, or the rights or obligations under, agreements between spouses under s. 732.701 or s. 732.702.

<p><b>61.08&nbsp; Alimony.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, the court may grant alimony to either party, which alimony may be rehabilitative or permanent in nature. In any award of alimony, the court may order periodic payments or payments in lump sum or both. The court may consider the adultery of either spouse and the circumstances thereof in determining the amount of alimony, if any, to be awarded. In all dissolution actions, the court shall include findings of fact relative to the factors enumerated in subsection (2) supporting an award or denial of alimony.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining a proper award of alimony or maintenance, the court shall consider all relevant economic factors, including but not limited to:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard of living established during the marriage.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of the marriage.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The age and the physical and emotional condition of each party.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial resources of each party, the nonmarital and the marital assets and liabilities distributed to each.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;When applicable, the time necessary for either party to acquire sufficient education or training to enable such party to find appropriate employment.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of each party to the marriage, including, but not limited to, services rendered in homemaking, child care, education, and career building of the other party.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;All sources of income available to either party.
<br><br>The court may consider any other factor necessary to do equity and justice between the parties.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent necessary to protect an award of alimony, the court may order any party who is ordered to pay alimony to purchase or maintain a life insurance policy or a bond, or to otherwise secure such alimony award with any other assets which may be suitable for that purpose.
<p>(4)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to any order requiring the payment of alimony entered on or after January 1, 1985, unless the provisions of paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) apply, the court shall direct in the order that the payments of alimony be made through the appropriate depository as provided in s. 61.181.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to any order requiring the payment of alimony entered before January 1, 1985, upon the subsequent appearance, on or after that date, of one or both parties before the court having jurisdiction for the purpose of modifying or enforcing the order or in any other proceeding related to the order, or upon the application of either party, unless the provisions of paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) apply, the court shall modify the terms of the order as necessary to direct that payments of alimony be made through the appropriate depository as provided in s. 61.181.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no minor child, alimony payments need not be directed through the depository.
<p>(d)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a minor child of the parties and both parties so request, the court may order that alimony payments need not be directed through the depository. In this case, the order of support shall provide, or be deemed to provide, that either party may subsequently apply to the depository to require that payments be made through the depository. The court shall provide a copy of the order to the depository.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the provisions of subparagraph 1. apply, either party may subsequently file with the depository an affidavit alleging default or arrearages in payment and stating that the party wishes to initiate participation in the depository program. The party shall provide copies of the affidavit to the court and the other party or parties. Fifteen days after receipt of the affidavit, the depository shall notify all parties that future payments shall be directed to the depository.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;In IV-D cases, the IV-D agency shall have the same rights as the obligee in requesting that payments be made through the depository.

<p><b>61.122&nbsp; Parenting plan recommendation; presumption of psychologist's good faith; prerequisite to parent's filing suit; award of fees, costs, reimbursement.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;A psychologist who has been appointed by the court to develop a parenting plan recommendation in a dissolution of marriage, a case of domestic violence, or a paternity matter involving the relationship of a child and a parent, including time-sharing of children, is presumed to be acting in good faith if the psychologist's recommendation has been reached under standards that a reasonable psychologist would use to develop a parenting plan recommendation.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrative complaint against a court-appointed psychologist which relates to a parenting plan recommendation conducted by the psychologist may not be filed anonymously. The individual who files an administrative complaint must include in the complaint his or her name, address, and telephone number.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent who desires to file a legal action against a court-appointed psychologist who has acted in good faith in developing a parenting plan recommendation must petition the judge who presided over the dissolution of marriage, case of domestic violence, or paternity matter involving the relationship of a child and a parent, including time-sharing of children, to appoint another psychologist. Upon the parent's showing of good cause, the court shall appoint another psychologist. The court shall determine as to who is responsible for all court costs and attorney's fees associated with making such an appointment.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a legal action, whether it be a civil action, a criminal action, or an administrative proceeding, is filed against a court-appointed psychologist in a dissolution of marriage, case of domestic violence, or paternity matter involving the relationship of a child and a parent, including time-sharing of children, the claimant is responsible for all reasonable costs and reasonable attorney's fees associated with the action for both parties if the psychologist is held not liable. If the psychologist is held liable in civil court, the psychologist must pay all reasonable costs and reasonable attorney's fees for the claimant.

<p><b>61.13&nbsp; Support of children; parenting and time-sharing; powers of court.</b>--
<p>(1)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a proceeding under this chapter, the court may at any time order either or both parents who owe a duty of support to a child to pay support to the other parent or, in the case of both parents, to the person with custody in accordance with the child support guidelines schedule in s. 61.30. The court initially entering an order requiring one or both parents to make child support payments has continuing jurisdiction after the entry of the initial order to modify the amount and terms and conditions of the child support payments when the modification is found necessary by the court in the best interests of the child, when the child reaches majority, when there is a substantial change in the circumstances of the parties, when s. 743.07(2) applies, or when a child is emancipated, marries, joins the armed services, or dies. The court initially entering a child support order has continuing jurisdiction to require the obligee to report to the court on terms prescribed by the court regarding the disposition of the child support payments.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each order for support shall contain a provision for health care coverage for the minor child when the coverage is reasonably available. Coverage is reasonably available if either the obligor or obligee has access at a reasonable rate to a group health plan. The court may require the obligor either to provide health care coverage or to reimburse the obligee for the cost of health care coverage for the minor child when coverage is provided by the obligee. In either event, the court shall apportion the cost of coverage, and any noncovered medical, dental, and prescription medication expenses of the child, to both parties by adding the cost to the basic obligation determined pursuant to s. 61.30(6). The court may order that payment of uncovered medical, dental, and prescription medication expenses of the minor child be made directly to the obligee on a percentage basis.
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a non-Title IV-D case, a copy of the court order for health care coverage shall be served on the obligor's union or employer by the obligee when the following conditions are met:
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligor fails to provide written proof to the obligee within 30 days after receiving effective notice of the court order that the health care coverage has been obtained or that application for coverage has been made;
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligee serves written notice of intent to enforce an order for health care coverage on the obligor by mail at the obligor's last known address; and
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligor fails within 15 days after the mailing of the notice to provide written proof to the obligee that the health care coverage existed as of the date of mailing.
<p>2.a.&nbsp;&nbsp;A support order enforced under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act which requires that the obligor provide health care coverage is enforceable by the department through the use of the national medical support notice, and an amendment to the support order is not required. The department shall transfer the national medical support notice to the obligor's union or employer. The department shall notify the obligor in writing that the notice has been sent to the obligor's union or employer, and the written notification must include the obligor's rights and duties under the national medical support notice. The obligor may contest the withholding required by the national medical support notice based on a mistake of fact. To contest the withholding, the obligor must file a written notice of contest with the department within 15 business days after the date the obligor receives written notification of the national medical support notice from the department. Filing with the department is complete when the notice is received by the person designated by the department in the written notification. The notice of contest must be in the form prescribed by the department. Upon the timely filing of a notice of contest, the department shall, within 5 business days, schedule an informal conference with the obligor to discuss the obligor's factual dispute. If the informal conference resolves the dispute to the obligor's satisfaction or if the obligor fails to attend the informal conference, the notice of contest is deemed withdrawn. If the informal conference does not resolve the dispute, the obligor may request an administrative hearing under chapter 120 within 5 business days after the termination of the informal conference, in a form and manner prescribed by the department. However, the filing of a notice of contest by the obligor does not delay the withholding of premium payments by the union, employer, or health plan administrator. The union, employer, or health plan administrator must implement the
withholding as directed by the national medical support notice unless notified by the department that the national medical support notice is terminated.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Title IV-D case, the department shall notify an obligor's union or employer if the obligation to provide health care coverage through that union or employer is terminated.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a non-Title IV-D case, upon receipt of the order pursuant to subparagraph 1., or upon application of the obligor pursuant to the order, the union or employer shall enroll the minor child as a beneficiary in the group health plan regardless of any restrictions on the enrollment period and withhold any required premium from the obligor's income. If more than one plan is offered by the union or employer, the child shall be enrolled in the group health plan in which the obligor is enrolled.
<p>4.a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of the national medical support notice under subparagraph 2. in a Title IV-D case, the union or employer shall transfer the notice to the appropriate group health plan administrator within 20 business days after the date on the notice. The plan administrator must enroll the child as a beneficiary in the group health plan regardless of any restrictions on the enrollment period, and the union or employer must withhold any required premium from the obligor's income upon notification by the plan administrator that the child is enrolled. The child shall be enrolled in the group health plan in which the obligor is enrolled. If the group health plan in which the obligor is enrolled is not available where the child resides or if the obligor is not enrolled in group coverage, the child shall be enrolled in the lowest cost group health plan that is available where the child resides.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;If health care coverage or the obligor's employment is terminated in a Title IV-D case, the union or employer that is withholding premiums for health care coverage under a national medical support notice must notify the department within 20 days after the termination and provide the obligor's last known address and the name and address of the obligor's new employer, if known.
<p>5.a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount withheld by a union or employer in compliance with a support order may not exceed the amount allowed under s. 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. s. 1673(b), as amended. The union or employer shall withhold the maximum allowed by the Consumer Credit Protection Act in the following order:
<p>(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;Current support, as ordered.
<p>(II)&nbsp;&nbsp;Premium payments for health care coverage, as ordered.
<p>(III)&nbsp;&nbsp;Past due support, as ordered.
<p>(IV)&nbsp;&nbsp;Other medical support or coverage, as ordered.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the combined amount to be withheld for current support plus the premium payment for health care coverage exceed the amount allowed under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, and the health care coverage cannot be obtained unless the full amount of the premium is paid, the union or employer may not withhold the premium payment. However, the union or employer shall withhold the maximum allowed in the following order:
<p>(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;Current support, as ordered.
<p>(II)&nbsp;&nbsp;Past due support, as ordered.
<p>(III)&nbsp;&nbsp;Other medical support or coverage, as ordered.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer, union, or plan administrator who does not comply with the requirements in sub-subparagraph 4.a. is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation and $500 for subsequent violations, plus attorney's fees and costs. The department may file a petition in circuit court to enforce the requirements of this subparagraph.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;The department may adopt rules to administer the child support enforcement provisions of this section that affect Title IV-D cases.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent necessary to protect an award of child support, the court may order the obligor to purchase or maintain a life insurance policy or a bond, or to otherwise secure the child support award with any other assets which may be suitable for that purpose.
<p>(d)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the provisions of subparagraph 3. apply, all child support orders entered on or after January 1, 1985, shall direct that the payments of child support be made as provided in s. 61.181 through the depository in the county where the court is located. All child support orders shall provide the full name and date of birth of each minor child who is the subject of the child support order.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the provisions of subparagraph 3. apply, all child support orders entered before January 1, 1985, shall be modified by the court to direct that payments of child support shall be made through the depository in the county where the court is located upon the subsequent appearance of either or both parents to modify or enforce the order, or in any related proceeding.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If both parties request and the court finds that it is in the best interest of the child, support payments need not be directed through the depository. The order of support shall provide, or shall be deemed to provide, that either party may subsequently apply to the depository to require direction of the payments through the depository. The court shall provide a copy of the order to the depository.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parties elect not to require that support payments be made through the depository, any party may subsequently file an affidavit with the depository alleging a default in payment of child support and stating that the party wishes to require that payments be made through the depository. The party shall provide copies of the affidavit to the court and to each other party. Fifteen days after receipt of the affidavit, the depository shall notify both parties that future payments shall be paid through the depository.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;In IV-D cases, the IV-D agency shall have the same rights as the obligee in requesting that payments be made through the depository.
<p>(2)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court shall have jurisdiction to approve, grant, or modify a parenting plan, notwithstanding that the child is not physically present in this state at the time of filing any proceeding under this chapter, if it appears to the court that the child was removed from this state for the primary purpose of removing the child from the jurisdiction of the court in an attempt to avoid the court's approval, creation, or modification of a parenting plan.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any parenting plan approved by the court must, at minimum, describe in adequate detail how the parents will share and be responsible for the daily tasks associated with the upbringing of the child, the time-sharing schedule arrangements that specify the time that the minor child will spend with each parent, a designation of who will be responsible for any and all forms of health care, school-related matters, other activities, and the methods and technologies that the parents will use to communicate with the child.
<p>(c)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court shall determine all matters relating to parenting and time-sharing of each minor child of the parties in accordance with the best interests of the child and in accordance with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. It is the public policy of this state to assure that each minor child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents after the parents separate or the marriage of the parties is dissolved and to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibilities, and joys, of childrearing. There is no presumption for or against the father or mother of the child when creating or modifying the parenting plan of the child.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court shall order that the parental responsibility for a minor child be shared by both parents unless the court finds that shared parental responsibility would be detrimental to the child. Evidence that a parent has been convicted of a felony of the third degree or higher involving domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28 and chapter 775, or meets the criteria of s. 39.806(1)(d), creates a rebuttable presumption of detriment to the child. If the presumption is not rebutted, shared parental responsibility, including time-sharing with the child, and decisions made regarding the child, may not be granted to the convicted parent. However, the convicted parent is not relieved of any obligation to provide financial support. If the court determines that shared parental responsibility would be detrimental to the child, it may order sole parental responsibility and make such arrangements for time-sharing as specified in the parenting plan as will best protect the child or abused spouse from further harm. Whether or not there is a conviction of any offense of domestic violence or child abuse or the existence of an injunction for protection against domestic violence, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence or child abuse as evidence of detriment to the child.
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;In ordering shared parental responsibility, the court may consider the expressed desires of the parents and may grant to one party the ultimate responsibility over specific aspects of the child's welfare or may divide those responsibilities between the parties based on the best interests of the child. Areas of responsibility may include education, health care, and any other responsibilities that the court finds unique to a particular family.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court shall order "sole parental responsibility for a minor child to one parent, with or without time-sharing with the other parent" when it is in the best interests of the minor child.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to records and information pertaining to a minor child, including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and school records, may not be denied to either parent. Full rights under this subparagraph apply to either parent unless a court order specifically revokes these rights, including any restrictions on these rights as provided in a domestic violence injunction. A parent having rights under this subparagraph has the same rights upon request as to form, substance, and manner of access as are available to the other parent of a child, including, without limitation, the right to in-person communication with medical, dental, and education providers.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The circuit court in the county in which either parent and the child reside or the circuit court in which the original order approving or creating the parenting plan was entered has jurisdiction to modify the parenting plan. The court may change the venue in accordance with s. 47.122.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of establishing or modifying parental responsibility and creating, developing, approving, or modifying a parenting plan, including a time-sharing schedule, which governs each parent's relationship with his or her minor child and the relationship between each parent with regard to his or her minor child, the best interest of the child shall be the primary consideration. Determination of the best interests of the child shall be made by evaluating all of the factors affecting the welfare and interests of the minor child, including, but not limited to:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship, to honor the time-sharing schedule, and to be reasonable when changes are required.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The anticipated division of parental responsibilities after the litigation, including the extent to which parental responsibilities will be delegated to third parties.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to determine, consider, and act upon the needs of the child as opposed to the needs or desires of the parent.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The geographic viability of the parenting plan, with special attention paid to the needs of school-age children and the amount of time to be spent traveling to effectuate the parenting plan. This factor does not create a presumption for or against relocation of either parent with a child.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral fitness of the parents.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental and physical health of the parents.
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;The home, school, and community record of the child.
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasonable preference of the child, if the court deems the child to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience to express a preference.
<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrated knowledge, capacity, and disposition of each parent to be informed of the circumstances of the minor child, including, but not limited to, the child's friends, teachers, medical care providers, daily activities, and favorite things.
<p>(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to provide a consistent routine for the child, such as discipline, and daily schedules for homework, meals, and bedtime.
<p>(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrated capacity of each parent to communicate with and keep the other parent informed of issues and activities regarding the minor child, and the willingness of each parent to adopt a unified front on all major issues when dealing with the child.
<p>(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, regardless of whether a prior or pending action relating to those issues has been brought.
<p>(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence that either parent has knowingly provided false information to the court regarding any prior or pending action regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect.
<p>(o)&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular parenting tasks customarily performed by each parent and the division of parental responsibilities before the institution of litigation and during the pending litigation, including the extent to which parenting responsibilities were undertaken by third parties.
<p>(p)&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to participate and be involved in the child's school and extracurricular activities.
<p>(q)&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to maintain an environment for the child which is free from substance abuse.
<p>(r)&nbsp;&nbsp;The capacity and disposition of each parent to protect the child from the ongoing litigation as demonstrated by not discussing the litigation with the child, not sharing documents or electronic media related to the litigation with the child, and refraining from disparaging comments about the other parent to the child.
<p>(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;The developmental stages and needs of the child and the demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to meet the child's developmental needs.
<p>(t)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other factor that is relevant to the determination of a specific parenting plan, including the time-sharing schedule.
<p>(4)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a parent who is ordered to pay child support or alimony fails to pay child support or alimony, the parent who should have received the child support or alimony may not refuse to honor the time-sharing schedule presently in effect between the parents.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a parent refuses to honor the other parent's rights under the time-sharing schedule, the parent whose time-sharing rights were violated shall continue to pay any ordered child support or alimony.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a parent refuses to honor the time-sharing schedule in the parenting plan without proper cause, the court:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall, after calculating the amount of time-sharing improperly denied, award the parent denied time a sufficient amount of extra time-sharing to compensate for the time-sharing missed, and such time-sharing shall be ordered as expeditiously as possible in a manner consistent with the best interests of the child and scheduled in a manner that is convenient for the parent deprived of time-sharing. In ordering any makeup time-sharing, the court shall schedule such time-sharing in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of the child or children and that is convenient for the nonoffending parent and at the expense of the noncompliant parent.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;May order the parent who did not provide time-sharing or did not properly exercise time-sharing under the time-sharing schedule to pay reasonable court costs and attorney's fees incurred by the nonoffending parent to enforce the time-sharing schedule.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;May order the parent who did not provide time-sharing or did not properly exercise time-sharing under the time-sharing schedule to attend a parenting course approved by the judicial circuit.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;May order the parent who did not provide time-sharing or did not properly exercise time-sharing under the time-sharing schedule to do community service if the order will not interfere with the welfare of the child.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;May order the parent who did not provide time-sharing or did not properly exercise time-sharing under the time-sharing schedule to have the financial burden of promoting frequent and continuing contact when that parent and child reside further than 60 miles from the other parent.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;May, upon the request of the parent who did not violate the time-sharing schedule, modify the parenting plan if modification is in the best interests of the child.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;May impose any other reasonable sanction as a result of noncompliance.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who violates this subsection may be punished by contempt of court or other remedies as the court deems appropriate.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may make specific orders regarding the parenting plan and time-sharing schedule as such orders relate to the circumstances of the parties and the nature of the case and are equitable and provide for child support in accordance with the guidelines schedule in s. 61.30. An order for equal time-sharing for a minor child does not preclude the court from entering an order for child support of the child.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;In any proceeding under this section, the court may not deny shared parental responsibility and time-sharing rights to a parent solely because that parent is or is believed to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, but the court may condition such rights to require that parent in an order approving the parenting plan to observe measures approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States Public Health Service or by the Department of Health for preventing the spread of human immunodeficiency virus to the child.
<p>(7)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party to any paternity or support proceeding is required to file with the tribunal as defined in s. 88.1011(22) and State Case Registry upon entry of an order, and to update as appropriate, information on location and identity of the party, including social security number, residential and mailing addresses, telephone number, driver's license number, and name, address, and telephone number of employer. Each party to any paternity or child support proceeding in a non-Title IV-D case shall meet the above requirements for updating the tribunal and State Case Registry.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, each party is required to provide his or her social security number in accordance with this section. Disclosure of social security numbers obtained through this requirement shall be limited to the purpose of administration of the Title IV-D program for child support enforcement.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;In any subsequent Title IV-D child support enforcement action between the parties, upon sufficient showing that diligent effort has been made to ascertain the location of such a party, the court of competent jurisdiction shall deem state due process requirements for notice and service of process to be met with respect to the party, upon delivery of written notice to the most recent residential or employer address filed with the tribunal and State Case Registry pursuant to paragraph (a). In any subsequent non-Title IV-D child support enforcement action between the parties, the same requirements for service shall apply.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time an order for child support is entered, each party is required to provide his or her social security number and date of birth to the court, as well as the name, date of birth, and social security number of each minor child that is the subject of such child support order. Pursuant to the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, each party is required to provide his or her social security number in accordance with this section. All social security numbers required by this section shall be provided by the parties and maintained by the depository as a separate attachment in the file. Disclosure of social security numbers obtained through this requirement shall be limited to the purpose of administration of the Title IV-D program for child support enforcement.

</small>

<p><b><SUP>1</SUP>61.13001&nbsp; Parental relocation with a child.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS.--As used in this section, the term:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change of residence address" means the relocation of a child to a principal residence more than 50 miles away from his or her principal place of residence at the time of the entry of the last order establishing or modifying the parenting plan or the time-sharing schedule or both for the minor child, unless the move places the principal residence of the minor child less than 50 miles from either parent.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Child" means any person who is under the jurisdiction of a state court pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act or is the subject of any order granting to a parent or other person any right to time-sharing, residential care, kinship, or custody, as provided under state law.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Court" means the circuit court in an original proceeding which has proper venue and jurisdiction in accordance with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, the circuit court in the county in which either parent and the child reside, or the circuit court in which the original action was adjudicated.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other person" means an individual who is not the parent and who, by court order, maintains the primary residence of a child or has visitation rights with a child.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parent" means any person so named by court order or express written agreement that is subject to court enforcement or a person reflected as a parent on a birth certificate and in whose home a child maintains a residence.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relocation" means a change in the principal residence of a child for a period of 60 consecutive days or more but does not include a temporary absence from the principal residence for purposes of vacation, education, or the provision of health care for the child.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;RELOCATION BY AGREEMENT.--
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parents and every other person entitled to time-sharing with the child agree to the relocation of the child, they may satisfy the requirements of this section by signing a written agreement that:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflects the consent to the relocation;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Defines a time-sharing schedule for the nonrelocating parent and any other persons who are entitled to time-sharing; and
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Describes, if necessary, any transportation arrangements related to the visitation.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an existing cause of action, judgment, or decree of record pertaining to the child's residence or a time-sharing schedule, the parties shall seek ratification of the agreement by court order without the necessity of an evidentiary hearing unless a hearing is requested, in writing, by one or more of the parties to the agreement within 10 days after the date the agreement is filed with the court. If a hearing is not timely requested, it shall be presumed that the relocation is in the best interest of the child and the court may ratify the agreement without an evidentiary hearing.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTICE OF INTENT TO RELOCATE WITH A CHILD.--Unless an agreement has been entered as described in subsection (2), a parent who is entitled to time-sharing with the child shall notify the other parent, and every other person entitled to time-sharing with the child, of a proposed relocation of the child's residence. The form of notice shall be according to this section:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent seeking to relocate shall prepare a Notice of Intent to Relocate. The following information must be included with the Notice of Intent to Relocate and signed under oath under penalty of perjury:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of the location of the intended new residence, including the state, city, and specific physical address, if known.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mailing address of the intended new residence, if not the same as the physical address, if known.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The home telephone number of the intended new residence, if known.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The date of the intended move or proposed relocation.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;A detailed statement of the specific reasons for the proposed relocation of the child. If one of the reasons is based upon a job offer which has been reduced to writing, that written job offer must be attached to the Notice of Intent to Relocate.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;A proposal for the revised postrelocation schedule of time-sharing together with a proposal for the postrelocation transportation arrangements necessary to effectuate time-sharing with the child. Absent the existence of a current, valid order abating, terminating, or restricting visitation or other good cause predating the Notice of Intent to Relocate, failure to comply with this provision renders the Notice of Intent to Relocate legally insufficient.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantially the following statement, in all capital letters and in the same size type, or larger, as the type in the remainder of the notice:
<br>
<br><br>AN OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSED RELOCATION MUST BE MADE IN WRITING, FILED WITH THE COURT, AND SERVED ON THE PARENT OR OTHER PERSON SEEKING TO RELOCATE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER SERVICE OF THIS NOTICE OF INTENT TO RELOCATE. IF YOU FAIL TO TIMELY OBJECT TO THE RELOCATION, THE RELOCATION WILL BE ALLOWED, UNLESS IT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD, WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE AND WITHOUT A HEARING.
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mailing address of the parent or other person seeking to relocate to which the objection filed under subsection (5) to the Notice of Intent to Relocate should be sent.
<br><br>The contents of the Notice of Intent to Relocate are not privileged. For purposes of encouraging amicable resolution of the relocation issue, a copy of the Notice of Intent to Relocate shall initially not be filed with the court but instead served upon the nonrelocating parent, other person, and every other person entitled to time-sharing with the child, and the original thereof shall be maintained by the parent or other person seeking to relocate.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent seeking to relocate shall also prepare a Certificate of Serving Notice of Intent to Relocate. The certificate shall certify the date that the Notice of Intent to Relocate was served on the other parent and on every other person entitled to time-sharing with the child.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notice of Intent to Relocate, and the Certificate of Serving Notice of Intent to Relocate, shall be served on the other parent and on every other person entitled to time-sharing with the child. If there is a pending court action regarding the child, service of process may be according to court rule. Otherwise, service of process shall be according to chapters 48 and 49 or via certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;A person giving notice of a proposed relocation or change of residence address under this section has a continuing duty to provide current and updated information required by this section when that information becomes known.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other parent and any other person entitled to time-sharing with the child fails to timely file an objection, it shall be presumed that the relocation is in the best interest of the child, the relocation shall be allowed, and the court shall, absent good cause, enter an order, attaching a copy of the Notice of Intent to Relocate, reflecting that the order is entered as a result of the failure to object to the Notice of Intent to Relocate, and adopting the time-sharing schedule and transportation arrangements contained in the Notice of Intent to Relocate. The order may issue in an expedited manner without the necessity of an evidentiary hearing. If an objection is timely filed, the burden returns to the parent or person seeking to relocate to initiate court proceedings to obtain court permission to relocate before doing so.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of relocating the child after failure to comply with the notice of intent to relocate procedure described in this subsection subjects the party in violation thereof to contempt and other proceedings to compel the return of the child and may be taken into account by the court in any initial or postjudgment action seeking a determination or modification of the parenting plan or the time-sharing schedule, or both, as:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A factor in making a determination regarding the relocation of a child.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A factor in determining whether the parenting plan or the time-sharing schedule should be modified.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;A basis for ordering the temporary or permanent return of the child.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient cause to order the parent or other person seeking to relocate the child to pay reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred by the party objecting to the relocation.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient cause for the award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs, including interim travel expenses incident to time-sharing or securing the return of the child.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;APPLICABILITY OF PUBLIC RECORDS LAW.--If the parent or other person seeking to relocate a child, or the child, is entitled to prevent disclosure of location information under any public records exemption applicable to that person, the court may enter any order necessary to modify the disclosure requirements of this section in compliance with the public records exemption.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTENT OF OBJECTION TO RELOCATION.--An objection seeking to prevent the relocation of a child must be verified and served within 30 days after service of the Notice of Intent to Relocate. The objection must include the specific factual basis supporting the reasons for seeking a prohibition of the relocation, including a statement of the amount of participation or involvement the objecting party currently has or has had in the life of the child.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;TEMPORARY ORDER.--
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may grant a temporary order restraining the relocation of a child or ordering the return of the child, if a relocation has previously taken place, or other appropriate remedial relief, if the court finds:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The required notice of a proposed relocation of a child was not provided in a timely manner;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The child already has been relocated without notice or written agreement of the parties or without court approval; or
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;From an examination of the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing that there is a likelihood that upon final hearing the court will not approve the relocation of the child.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may grant a temporary order permitting the relocation of the child pending final hearing, if the court:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finds that the required Notice of Intent to Relocate was provided in a timely manner; and
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finds from an examination of the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing that there is a likelihood that on final hearing the court will approve the relocation of the child, which findings must be supported by the same factual basis as would be necessary to support the permitting of relocation in a final judgment.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the court has issued a temporary order authorizing a party seeking to relocate or move a child before a final judgment is rendered, the court may not give any weight to the temporary relocation as a factor in reaching its final decision.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;If temporary relocation of a child is permitted, the court may require the person relocating the child to provide reasonable security, financial or otherwise, and guarantee that the court-ordered contact with the child will not be interrupted or interfered with by the relocating party.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;NO PRESUMPTION; FACTORS TO DETERMINE CONTESTED RELOCATION.--A presumption does not arise in favor of or against a request to relocate with the child when a parent seeks to move the child and the move will materially affect the current schedule of contact, access, and time-sharing with the nonrelocating parent or other person. In reaching its decision regarding a proposed temporary or permanent relocation, the court shall evaluate all of the following factors:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature, quality, extent of involvement, and duration of the child's relationship with the parent proposing to relocate with the child and with the nonrelocating parent, other persons, siblings, half-siblings, and other significant persons in the child's life.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The age and developmental stage of the child, the needs of the child, and the likely impact the relocation will have on the child's physical, educational, and emotional development, taking into consideration any special needs of the child.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The feasibility of preserving the relationship between the nonrelocating parent or other person and the child through substitute arrangements that take into consideration the logistics of contact, access, and time-sharing, as well as the financial circumstances of the parties; whether those factors are sufficient to foster a continuing meaningful relationship between the child and the nonrelocating parent or other person; and the likelihood of compliance with the substitute arrangements by the relocating parent once he or she is out of the jurisdiction of the court.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The child's preference, taking into consideration the age and maturity of the child.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the relocation will enhance the general quality of life for both the parent seeking the relocation and the child, including, but not limited to, financial or emotional benefits or educational opportunities.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons of each parent or other person for seeking or opposing the relocation.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The current employment and economic circumstances of each parent or other person and whether or not the proposed relocation is necessary to improve the economic circumstances of the parent or other person seeking relocation of the child.
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;That the relocation is sought in good faith and the extent to which the objecting parent has fulfilled his or her financial obligations to the parent or other person seeking relocation, including child support, spousal support, and marital property and marital debt obligations.
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The career and other opportunities available to the objecting parent or objecting other person if the relocation occurs.
<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;A history of substance abuse or domestic violence as defined in s. 741.28 or which meets the criteria of s. 39.806(1)(d) by either parent, including a consideration of the severity of such conduct and the failure or success of any attempts at rehabilitation.
<p>(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other factor affecting the best interest of the child or as set forth in s. 61.13.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;BURDEN OF PROOF.--The parent or other person wishing to relocate has the burden of proof if an objection is filed and must then initiate a proceeding seeking court permission for relocation. The initial burden is on the parent or person wishing to relocate to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that relocation is in the best interest of the child. If that burden of proof is met, the burden shifts to the nonrelocating parent or other person to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed relocation is not in the best interest of the child.
<p>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;ORDER REGARDING RELOCATION.--If relocation is permitted:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may, in its discretion, order contact with the nonrelocating parent, including access, time-sharing, telephone, Internet, webcam, and other arrangements sufficient to ensure that the child has frequent, continuing, and meaningful contact, access, and time-sharing with the nonrelocating parent or other persons, if contact is financially affordable and in the best interest of the child.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If applicable, the court shall specify how the transportation costs will be allocated between the parents and other persons entitled to contact, access, and time-sharing and may adjust the child support award, as appropriate, considering the costs of transportation and the respective net incomes of the parents in accordance with the state child support guidelines schedule.
<p>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIORITY FOR HEARING OR TRIAL.--An evidentiary hearing or nonjury trial on a pleading seeking temporary or permanent relief filed under this section shall be accorded priority on the court's calendar.
<p>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;APPLICABILITY.--
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;This section applies:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;To orders entered before October 1, 2006, if the existing order defining custody, primary residence, time-sharing, or visitation of or with the child does not expressly govern the relocation of the child.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;To an order, whether temporary or permanent, regarding the parenting plan, custody, primary residence, time-sharing, or visitation of or with the child entered on or after October 1, 2006.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;To any relocation or proposed relocation, whether permanent or temporary, of a child during any proceeding pending on October 1, 2006, wherein the parenting plan, custody, primary residence, time-sharing, or visitation of or with the child is an issue.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that a provision of this section conflicts with an order existing on October 1, 2006, this section does not apply to the terms of that order which expressly govern relocation of the child or a change in the principal residence address of a parent.

<p><b>61.13002&nbsp; Temporary time-sharing modification and child support modification due to military service.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a supplemental petition or a motion for modification of time-sharing and parental responsibility is filed because a parent is activated, deployed, or temporarily assigned to military service and the parent's ability to comply with time-sharing is materially affected as a result, the court may not issue an order or modify or amend a previous judgment or order that changes time-sharing as it existed on the date the parent was activated, deployed, or temporarily assigned to military service, except that a court may enter a temporary order to modify or amend time-sharing if there is clear and convincing evidence that the temporary modification or amendment is in the best interests of the child. When entering a temporary order under this section, the court shall consider and provide for, if feasible, contact between the military servicemember and his or her child, including, but not limited to, electronic communication by webcam, telephone, or other available means. The court shall also permit liberal time-sharing during periods of leave from military service, as it is in the child's best interests to maintain the parent-child bond during the parent's military service.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a temporary order is issued under this section, the court shall reinstate the time-sharing order previously in effect upon the servicemember parent's return from active military service, deployment, or temporary assignment.

<p><b>61.13003&nbsp; Court-ordered electronic communication between a parent and a child.</b>--
<p>(1)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with proceedings under this chapter, a court may order electronic communication between a parent and a child. Before ordering electronic communication, a court must consider:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether electronic communication is in a child's best interests;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether communication equipment and technology to provide electronic communication is reasonably available, accessible, and affordable;
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each parent's history of substance abuse or domestic violence; and
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other factor that the court considers material.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a rebuttable presumption is created providing that it is in the best interests of a child for a parent and child to have reasonable telephone communication. Unless this presumption is rebutted, the court shall order telephone communication.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may set safeguards or guidelines for electronic communication.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the court finds that one or both parents will incur additional costs in order to implement electronic communication with the child, the court shall allocate such expenses arising solely from the electronic communication between the parents after considering the respective parent's financial circumstances.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the court enters an order granting electronic communication, each parent shall furnish the other parent with the access information necessary to facilitate electronic communication. Each parent shall notify the other parent of any change in the access information within 7 days after the change.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic communication may be used only to supplement a parent's face-to-face contact with his or her minor child. Electronic communication may not be used to replace or as a substitute for face-to-face contact.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;A party to a child custody order that does not prohibit electronic communication may move a court to order electronic communication. Such a party need not prove a substantial change in circumstances.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may not consider the availability of electronic communication as the sole determinative factor when considering relocation.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent or amount of time that electronic communication with the child is ordered under s. 61.13 may not be used as a factor when the court calculates child support.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;This section does not apply to any judgment or order issued before October 1, 2007.

<p><b>61.1301&nbsp; Income deduction orders.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;ISSUANCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN ORDER ESTABLISHING, ENFORCING, OR MODIFYING AN OBLIGATION FOR ALIMONY OR CHILD SUPPORT.--
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the entry of an order establishing, enforcing, or modifying an obligation for alimony, for child support, or for alimony and child support, other than a temporary order, the court shall enter a separate order for income deduction if one has not been entered. Upon the entry of a temporary order establishing support or the entry of a temporary order enforcing or modifying a temporary order of support, the court may enter a separate order of income deduction. Copies of the orders shall be served on the obligee and obligor. If the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation directs that payments be made through the depository, the court shall provide to the depository a copy of the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation. If the obligee is a recipient of Title IV-D services, the court shall furnish to the Title IV-D agency a copy of the income deduction order and the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation.
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Title IV-D cases, the Title IV-D agency may implement income deduction after receiving a copy of an order from the court under this paragraph or a forwarding agency under UIFSA, URESA, or RURESA by issuing an income deduction notice to the payor.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The income deduction notice must state that it is based upon a valid support order and that it contains an income deduction requirement or upon a separate income deduction order. The income deduction notice must contain the notice to payor provisions specified by paragraph (2)(e). The income deduction notice must contain the following information from the income deduction order upon which the notice is based: the case number, the court that entered the order, and the date entered.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Payors shall deduct support payments from income, as specified in the income deduction notice, in the manner provided under paragraph (2)(e).
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;In non-Title IV-D cases, the income deduction notice must be accompanied by a copy of the support order upon which the notice is based. In Title IV-D cases, upon request of a payor, the Title IV-D agency shall furnish the payor a copy of the income deduction order.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a support order entered before January 1, 1994, in a non-Title IV-D case does not specify income deduction, income deduction may be initiated upon a delinquency without the need for any amendment to the support order or any further action by the court. In such case the obligee may implement income deduction by serving a notice of delinquency on the obligor as provided for under paragraph (f).
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The income deduction order shall:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct a payor to deduct from all income due and payable to an obligor the amount required by the court to meet the obligor's support obligation including any attorney's fees or costs owed and forward the deducted amount pursuant to the order.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;State the amount of arrearage owed, if any, and direct a payor to withhold an additional 20 percent or more of the periodic amount specified in the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation, until full payment is made of any arrearage, attorney's fees and costs owed, provided no deduction shall be applied to attorney's fees and costs until the full amount of any arrearage is paid.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide that if a delinquency accrues after the order establishing, modifying, or enforcing the obligation has been entered and there is no order for repayment of the delinquency or a preexisting arrearage, a payor shall deduct an additional 20 percent of the current support obligation or other amount agreed to by the parties until the delinquency and any attorney's fees and costs are paid in full. No deduction may be applied to attorney's fees and costs until the delinquency is paid in full.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct a payor not to deduct in excess of the amounts allowed under s. 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. s. 1673(b), as amended.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct whether a payor shall deduct all, a specified portion, or no income which is paid in the form of a bonus or other similar one-time payment, up to the amount of arrearage reported in the income deduction notice or the remaining balance thereof, and forward the payment to the governmental depository. For purposes of this subparagraph, "bonus" means a payment in addition to an obligor's usual compensation and which is in addition to any amounts contracted for or otherwise legally due and shall not include any commission payments due an obligor.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Title IV-D cases, direct a payor to provide to the court depository the date on which each deduction is made.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Title IV-D cases, if an obligation to pay current support is reduced or terminated due to emancipation of a child and the obligor owes an arrearage, retroactive support, delinquency, or costs, direct the payor to continue the income deduction at the rate in effect immediately prior to emancipation until all arrearages, retroactive support, delinquencies, and costs are paid in full or until the amount of withholding is modified.
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct that, at such time as the State Disbursement Unit becomes operational, all payments in those cases in which the obligee is receiving Title IV-D services and in those cases in which the obligee is not receiving Title IV-D services in which the initial support order was issued in this state on or after January 1, 1994, and in which the obligor's child support obligation is being paid through income deduction, be made payable to and delivered to the State Disbursement Unit. Notwithstanding any other statutory provision to the contrary, funds received by the State Disbursement Unit shall be held, administered, and disbursed by the State Disbursement Unit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The income deduction order is effective immediately unless the court upon good cause shown finds that the income deduction order shall be effective upon a delinquency in an amount specified by the court but not to exceed 1 month's payment, pursuant to the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation. In order to find good cause, the court must at a minimum make written findings that:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain why implementing immediate income deduction would not be in the child's best interest;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is proof of timely payment of the previously ordered obligation without an income deduction order in cases of modification; and
<p>3.a.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an agreement by the obligor to advise the IV-D agency and court depository of any change in payor and health insurance; or
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a signed written agreement providing an alternative arrangement between the obligor and the obligee and, at the option of the IV-D agency, by the IV-D agency in IV-D cases in which there is an assignment of support rights to the state, reviewed and entered in the record by the court.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The income deduction order shall be effective as long as the order upon which it is based is effective or until further order of the court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, at such time as the State Disbursement Unit becomes operational, in those cases in which the obligee is receiving Title IV-D services and in those cases in which the obligee is not receiving Title IV-D services in which the initial support order was issued in this state on or after January 1, 1994, and in which the obligor's child support obligation is being paid through income deduction, such payments shall be made payable to and delivered to the State Disbursement Unit.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;When the court orders the income deduction to be effective immediately, the court shall furnish to the obligor a statement of his or her rights, remedies, and duties in regard to the income deduction order. The statement shall state:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;All fees or interest which shall be imposed.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of income to be deducted for each pay period until the arrearage, if any, is paid in full and shall state the total amount of income to be deducted for each pay period thereafter. The amounts deducted may not be in excess of that allowed under s. 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. s. 1673(b), as amended.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;That the income deduction order applies to current and subsequent payors and periods of employment.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;That a copy of the income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, the income deduction notice will be served on the obligor's payor or payors.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;That enforcement of the income deduction order may only be contested on the ground of mistake of fact regarding the amount owed pursuant to the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation, the arrearages, or the identity of the obligor, the payor, or the obligee.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;That the obligor is required to notify the obligee and, when the obligee is receiving IV-D services, the IV-D agency within 7 days of changes in the obligor's address, payors, and the addresses of his or her payors.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;That in a Title IV-D case, if an obligation to pay current support is reduced or terminated due to emancipation of a child and the obligor owes an arrearage, retroactive support, delinquency, or costs, income deduction continues at the rate in effect immediately prior to emancipation until all arrearages, retroactive support, delinquencies, and costs are paid in full or until the amount of withholding is modified.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a support order was entered before January 1, 1994, the court orders the income deduction to be effective upon a delinquency as provided in paragraph (c), or a delinquency has accrued under an order entered before July 1, 2006, that established, modified, or enforced the obligation and there is no order for repayment of the delinquency or a preexisting arrearage, the obligee or, in Title IV-D cases, the Title IV-D agency may enforce the income deduction by serving a notice of delinquency on the obligor under this paragraph.
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice of delinquency shall state:
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of delinquency and the total amount of the delinquency as of the date the notice is mailed.
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;All fees or interest which may be imposed.
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of income to be deducted for each pay period until the arrearage, and all applicable fees and interest, is paid in full and shall state the total amount of income to be deducted for each pay period thereafter. The amounts deducted may not be in excess of that allowed under s. 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. s. 1673(b), as amended.
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;That the income deduction order applies to current and subsequent payors and periods of employment.
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;That a copy of the notice of delinquency will be served on the obligor's payor or payors, together with a copy of the income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, the income deduction notice, unless the obligor applies to the court to contest enforcement of the income deduction. If the income deduction order being enforced was rendered by the Title IV-D agency pursuant to s. 409.2563 and the obligor contests the deduction, the obligor shall file a petition for an administrative hearing with the Title IV-D agency. The application or petition shall be filed within 15 days after the date the notice of delinquency was served.
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;That enforcement of the income deduction order may only be contested on the ground of mistake of fact regarding the amount owed pursuant to the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation, the amount of arrearages, or the identity of the obligor, the payor, or the obligee.
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;That the obligor is required to notify the obligee of the obligor's current address and current payors and of the address of current payors. All changes shall be reported by the obligor within 7 days. If the IV-D agency is enforcing the order, the obligor shall make these notifications to the agency instead of to the obligee.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the obligor to receive the notice of delinquency does not preclude subsequent service of the income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, the income deduction notice on the obligor's payor. A notice of delinquency which fails to state an arrearage does not mean that an arrearage is not owed.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time, any party, including the IV-D agency, may apply to the court to:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Modify, suspend, or terminate the income deduction order in accordance with a modification, suspension, or termination of the support provisions in the underlying order; or
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Modify the amount of income deducted when the arrearage has been paid.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;ENFORCEMENT OF INCOME DEDUCTION ORDERS.--
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligee or his or her agent shall serve an income deduction order and notice to payor, or, in Title IV-D cases, the Title IV-D agency shall issue an income deduction notice, and in the case of a delinquency a notice of delinquency, on the obligor's payor unless the obligor has applied for a hearing to contest the enforcement of the income deduction pursuant to paragraph (c).
<p>(b)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Service by or upon any person who is a party to a proceeding under this section shall be made in the manner prescribed in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure for service upon parties.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Service upon an obligor's payor or successor payor under this section shall be made by prepaid certified mail, return receipt requested, or in the manner prescribed in chapter 48.
<p>(c)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligor, within 15 days after service of a notice of delinquency, may apply for a hearing to contest the enforcement of the income deduction on the ground of mistake of fact regarding the amount owed pursuant to an order establishing, enforcing, or modifying an obligation for alimony, for child support, or for alimony and child support, the amount of the arrearage, or the identity of the obligor, the payor, or the obligee. The obligor shall send a copy of the pleading to the obligee and, if the obligee is receiving IV-D services, to the IV-D agency. The timely filing of the pleading shall stay service of an income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice on all payors of the obligor until a hearing is held and a determination is made as to whether enforcement of the income deduction order is proper. The payment of a delinquent obligation by an obligor upon entry of an income deduction order shall not preclude service of the income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, an income deduction notice on the obligor's payor.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an obligor timely requests a hearing to contest enforcement of an income deduction order, the court, after due notice to all parties and the IV-D agency if the obligee is receiving IV-D services, shall hear the matter within 20 days after the application is filed. The court shall enter an order resolving the matter within 10 days after the hearing. A copy of this order shall be served on the parties and the IV-D agency if the obligee is receiving IV-D services. If the court determines that income deduction is proper, it shall specify the date the income deduction order must be served on the obligor's payor.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a court determines that an income deduction order is proper pursuant to paragraph (c), the obligee or his or her agent shall cause a copy of the notice of delinquency to be served on the obligor's payors. A copy of the income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice, and in the case of a delinquency a notice of delinquency, shall also be furnished to the obligor.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice to payor and income deduction notice. The notice to payor or, in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice shall contain only information necessary for the payor to comply with the order providing for income deduction. The notice shall:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide the obligor's social security number.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Require the payor to deduct from the obligor's income the amount specified in the income deduction order, and in the case of a delinquency the amount specified in the notice of delinquency, and to pay that amount to the obligee or to the depository, as appropriate. The amount actually deducted plus all administrative charges shall not be in excess of the amount allowed under s. 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. s. 1673(b);
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruct the payor to implement income deduction no later than the first payment date which occurs more than 14 days after the date the income deduction notice was served on the payor, and the payor shall conform the amount specified in the income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice to the obligor's pay cycle. The court should request at the time of the order that the payment cycle reflect that of the payor;
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruct the payor to forward, within 2 days after each date the obligor is entitled to payment from the payor, to the obligee or to the depository the amount deducted from the obligor's income, a statement as to whether the amount totally or partially satisfies the periodic amount specified in the income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice, and the specific date each deduction is made. If the IV-D agency is enforcing the order, the payor shall make these notifications to the agency instead of the obligee;
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify that if a payor fails to deduct the proper amount from the obligor's income, the payor is liable for the amount the payor should have deducted, plus costs, interest, and reasonable attorney's fees;
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide that the payor may collect up to $5 against the obligor's income to reimburse the payor for administrative costs for the first income deduction and up to $2 for each deduction thereafter;
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;State that the notice to payor or, in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice, and in the case of a delinquency the notice of delinquency, are binding on the payor until further notice by the obligee, IV-D agency, or the court or until the payor no longer provides income to the obligor;
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruct the payor that, when he or she no longer provides income to the obligor, he or she shall notify the obligee and shall also provide the obligor's last known address and the name and address of the obligor's new payor, if known; and that, if the payor violates this provision, the payor is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for any subsequent violation. If the IV-D agency is enforcing the order, the payor shall make these notifications to the agency instead of to the obligee. Penalties shall be paid to the obligee or the IV-D agency, whichever is enforcing the income deduction order;
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;State that the payor shall not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against an obligor because of the requirement for income deduction and shall state that a violation of this provision subjects the payor to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for any subsequent violation. Penalties shall be paid to the obligee or the IV-D agency, whichever is enforcing the income deduction, if any alimony or child support obligation is owing. If no alimony or child support obligation is owing, the penalty shall be paid to the obligor;
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;State that an obligor may bring a civil action in the courts of this state against a payor who refuses to employ, discharges, or otherwise disciplines an obligor because of income deduction. The obligor is entitled to reinstatement and all wages and benefits lost, plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred;
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inform the payor that the requirement for income deduction has priority over all other legal processes under state law pertaining to the same income and that payment, as required by the notice to payor or income deduction notice, is a complete defense by the payor against any claims of the obligor or his or her creditors as to the sum paid;
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inform the payor that, when the payor receives notices to payor or income deduction notices requiring that the income of two or more obligors be deducted and sent to the same depository, the payor may combine the amounts that are to be paid to the depository in a single payment as long as the payments attributable to each obligor are clearly identified;
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inform the payor that if the payor receives more than one notice to payor or income deduction notice against the same obligor, the payor shall contact the court or, in Title IV-D cases, the Title IV-D agency for further instructions. Upon being so contacted, the court or, in Title IV-D cases when all the cases upon which the notices are based are Title IV-D cases, the Title IV-D agency shall allocate amounts available for income deduction as provided in subsection (4); and
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;State that in a Title IV-D case, if an obligation to pay current support is reduced or terminated due to the emancipation of a child and the obligor owes an arrearage, retroactive support, delinquency, or costs, income deduction continues at the rate in effect immediately prior to emancipation until all arrearages, retroactive support, delinquencies, and costs are paid in full or until the amount of withholding is modified.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time an income deduction order is being enforced, the obligor may apply to the court for a hearing to contest the continued enforcement of the income deduction on the same grounds set out in paragraph (c), with a copy to the obligee and, in IV-D cases, to the IV-D agency. If the income deduction order being enforced was rendered by the IV-D agency pursuant to s. 409.2563 and the obligor contests the withholding, the obligor shall file a petition for an administrative hearing with the IV-D agency. The application or petition does not affect the continued enforcement of the income deduction until the court or IV-D agency, if applicable, enters an order granting relief to the obligor. The obligee or the IV-D agency is released from liability for improper receipt of moneys pursuant to an income deduction order upon return to the appropriate party of any moneys received.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;An obligee or his or her agent shall enforce an income deduction order against an obligor's successor payor who is located in this state in the same manner prescribed in this section for the enforcement of an income deduction order against a payor.
<p>(h)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an income deduction order is to be enforced against a payor located outside the state, the obligee who is receiving IV-D services or his or her agent shall promptly request the agency responsible for income deduction in the other state to enforce the income deduction order. The request shall contain all information necessary to enforce the income deduction order, including the amount to be periodically deducted, a copy of the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation, and a statement of arrearages, if applicable.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the IV-D agency is requested by the agency responsible for income deduction in another state to enforce an income deduction order against a payor located in this state for the benefit of an obligee who is being provided IV-D services by the agency in the other state, the IV-D agency shall act promptly pursuant to the applicable provisions of this section.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an obligor who is subject to an income deduction order enforced against a payor located in this state for the benefit of an obligee who is being provided IV-D services by the agency responsible for income deduction in another state terminates his or her relationship with his or her payor, the IV-D agency shall notify the agency in the other state and provide it with the name and address of the obligor and the address of any new payor of the obligor, if known.
<p>4.a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedural rules and laws of this state govern the procedural aspects of income deduction whenever the agency responsible for income deduction in another state requests the enforcement of an income deduction order in this state.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except with respect to when withholding must be implemented, which is controlled by the state where the order establishing, enforcing, or modifying the obligation was entered, the substantive law of this state shall apply whenever the agency responsible for income deduction in another state requests the enforcement of an income deduction in this state.
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the IV-D agency is requested by an agency responsible for income deduction in another state to implement income deduction against a payor located in this state for the benefit of an obligee who is being provided IV-D services by the agency in the other state or when the IV-D agency in this state initiates an income deduction request on behalf of an obligee receiving IV-D services in this state against a payor in another state, pursuant to this section or the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the IV-D agency shall file the interstate income deduction documents, or an affidavit of such request when the income deduction documents are not available, with the depository and if the IV-D agency in this state is responding to a request from another state, provide copies to the payor and obligor in accordance with subsection (1). The depository created pursuant to s. 61.181 shall accept the interstate income deduction documents or affidavit and shall establish an account for the receipt and disbursement of child support or child support and alimony payments and advise the IV-D agency of the account number in writing within 2 days after receipt of the documents or affidavit.
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified copies of payment records maintained by a depository shall, without further proof, be admitted into evidence in any legal proceeding in this state.
<p>(j)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A person may not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against an employee because of the enforcement of an income deduction order. An employer who violates this subsection is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for any subsequent violation. Penalties shall be paid to the obligee or the IV-D agency, whichever is enforcing the income deduction, if any alimony or child support is owing. If no alimony or child support is owing, the penalty shall be paid to the obligor.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may bring a civil action in the courts of this state against an employer who refuses to employ, discharges, or otherwise disciplines an employee because of an income deduction order. The employee is entitled to reinstatement and all wages and benefits lost plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred.
<p>(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a payor no longer provides income to an obligor, he or she shall notify the obligee and, if the obligee is a IV-D applicant, the IV-D agency and shall also provide the obligor's last known address and the name and address of the obligor's new payor, if known. A payor who violates this subsection is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for a subsequent violation. Penalties shall be paid to the obligee or the IV-D agency, whichever is enforcing the income deduction order.
<p>(3)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the Legislature that this section may be used to collect arrearages in child support or in alimony payments.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Title IV-D case, if an obligation to pay current support is reduced or terminated due to the emancipation of a child and the obligor owes an arrearage, retroactive support, delinquency, or costs, income deduction continues at the rate in effect immediately prior to emancipation until all arrearages, retroactive support, delinquencies, and costs are paid in full or until the amount of withholding is modified. Any income-deducted amount that is in excess of the obligation to pay current support shall be credited against the arrearages, retroactive support, delinquency, and costs owed by the obligor. The department shall send notice of this requirement by regular mail to the payor and the depository operated pursuant to s. 61.181, and the notice shall state the amount of the obligation to pay current support, if any, and the amount owed for arrearages, retroactive support, delinquency, and costs. For income deduction orders entered before July 1, 2004, which do not include this requirement, the department shall send by certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, to the obligor at the most recent address provided by the obligor to the tribunal that issued the order or a more recent address if known, notice of this requirement, that the obligor may contest the withholding as provided by paragraph (2)(f), and that the obligor may request the tribunal that issued the income deduction to modify the amount of the withholding. This paragraph provides an additional remedy for collection of unpaid support and applies to cases in which a support order or income deduction order was entered before, on, or after July 1, 2004.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a delinquency accrues after an order establishing, modifying, or enforcing a support obligation has been entered, an income deduction order entered after July 1, 2006, is in effect, and there is no order for repayment of the delinquency or a preexisting arrearage, a payor who is served with an income deduction order or, in a Title IV-D case, an income deduction notice shall deduct an additional 20 percent of the current support obligation or other amount agreed to by the parties until the delinquency and any attorney's fees and costs are paid in full. No deduction may be applied to attorney's fees and costs until the delinquency is paid in full.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is more than one income deduction notice against the same obligor, the amounts available for income deduction must be allocated among all obligee families as follows:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;For computation purposes, all obligations must be converted to a common payroll frequency, and the percentage of deduction allowed under s. 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. s. 1673(b), as amended, must be determined. The amount of income available for deduction is determined by multiplying that percentage by the obligor's net income.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the total monthly support obligation to all families is less than the amount of income available for deduction, the full amount of each obligation must be deducted.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the total monthly support obligation to all families is greater than the amount of income available for deduction, the amount of the deduction must be prorated, giving priority to current support, so that each family is allocated a percentage of the amount deducted. The percentage to be allocated to each family is determined by dividing each current support obligation by the total of all current support obligations. If the total of all current support obligations is less than the income available for deduction, and past due support is owed to more than one family, then the remainder of the available income must be prorated so that each family is allocated a percentage of the remaining income available for deduction. The percentage to be allocated to each family is determined by dividing each past due support obligation by the total of all past due support obligations.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;By July 1, 2006, the department shall provide a payor with Internet access to income deduction and national medical support notices issued by the department on or after July 1, 2006, concerning an obligor to whom the payor pays income. The department shall provide a payor who requests Internet access with a user code and password to allow the payor to receive notices electronically and to download the information necessary to begin income deduction and health care coverage enrollment. If a participating payor does not respond to electronic notice by accessing the data posted by the department within 48 hours, the department shall mail the income deduction or medical support notice to the payor.

<p><b>61.13015&nbsp; Petition for suspension or denial of professional licenses and certificates.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;An obligee may petition the court which entered the support order or the court which is enforcing the support order for an order to suspend or deny the license or certificate issued pursuant to chapters 409, 455, 456, 559, and 1012 of any obligor with a delinquent support obligation. However, no petition may be filed until the obligee has exhausted all other available remedies. The purpose of this section is to promote the public policy of s. 409.2551.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligee shall give notice to any obligor when a delinquency exists in the support obligation. The notice shall specify that the obligor has 30 days from the date on which service of the notice is complete to pay the delinquency or to reach an agreement with the obligee to pay the delinquency. The notice shall specify that, if payment is not made or an agreement cannot be reached, the license or certificate may be denied or suspended pursuant to a court order.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a delinquency exists and the obligor fails to pay the delinquency or to reach an agreement to pay the delinquency within 30 days following completion of service of the notice of the delinquency, the obligee shall send a second notice to the obligor stating that the obligor has 30 days to pay the delinquency or reach an agreement with the obligee to pay the delinquency. If the obligor fails to respond to either notice from the obligee or if the obligor fails to pay the delinquency or to reach an agreement to pay the delinquency after the second notice, the obligee may petition the court to deny the application for the license or certificate or to suspend the license or certificate of the obligor. The court may find that it would be inappropriate to deny or suspend a license or certificate if:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Denial or suspension would result in irreparable harm to the obligor or employees of the obligor or would not accomplish the objective of collecting the delinquency; or
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligor demonstrates that he or she has made a good faith effort to reach an agreement with the obligee.
<br><br>The court may not deny or suspend a license or certificate if the court determines that an alternative remedy is available to the obligee which is likely to accomplish the objective of collecting the delinquency. If the obligor fails in the defense of a petition for denial or suspension, the court which entered the support order or the court which is enforcing the support order shall enter an order to deny the application for the license or certificate or to suspend the license or certificate of the obligor. In the case of suspension, the court shall order the obligor to surrender the certificate or license to the department or to the licensing board which issued the license or certificate. In the case of denial, the court shall order the appropriate department or licensing board to deny the application.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the court denies or suspends a license or certificate and the obligor subsequently pays the delinquency or reaches an agreement with the obligee to settle the delinquency and makes the first payment required by the agreement, the license or certificate shall be issued or reinstated upon written proof to the court that the obligor has complied with the court order. Proof of payment shall consist of a certified copy of the payment record issued by the depository. The court shall order the appropriate department or licensing board to issue or reinstate the license or certificate without additional charge to the obligor.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice shall be served under this section by mailing it by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the obligor at his or her last address of record with the local depository. If the obligor has no address of record with the local depository, or if the last address of record with the local depository is incorrect, service shall be by publication as provided in chapter 49. When service of the notice is made by mail, service is complete upon the receipt of the notice by the obligor.

<p><b>61.13016&nbsp; Suspension of driver's licenses and motor vehicle registrations.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver's license and motor vehicle registration of a support obligor who is delinquent in payment or who has failed to comply with subpoenas or a similar order to appear or show cause relating to paternity or support proceedings may be suspended. When an obligor is 15 days delinquent making a payment in support or failure to comply with a subpoena, order to appear, order to show cause, or similar order in IV-D cases, the Title IV-D agency may provide notice to the obligor of the delinquency or failure to comply with a subpoena, order to appear, order to show cause, or similar order and the intent to suspend by regular United States mail that is posted to the obligor's last address of record with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. When an obligor is 15 days delinquent in making a payment in support in non-IV-D cases, and upon the request of the obligee, the depository or the clerk of the court must provide notice to the obligor of the delinquency and the intent to suspend by regular United States mail that is posted to the obligor's last address of record with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. In either case, the notice must state:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the order creating the support obligation;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of the delinquency and the total amount of the delinquency as of the date of the notice or describe the subpoena, order to appear, order to show cause, or other similar order which has not been complied with;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;That notification will be given to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to suspend the obligor's driver's license and motor vehicle registration unless, within 20 days after the date the notice is mailed, the obligor:
<p>1.a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pays the delinquency in full and any other costs and fees accrued between the date of the notice and the date the delinquency is paid;
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enters into a written agreement for payment with the obligee in non-IV-D cases or with the Title IV-D agency in IV-D cases; or in IV-D cases, complies with a subpoena or order to appear, order to show cause, or a similar order; or
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Files a petition with the circuit court to contest the delinquency action; and
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pays any applicable delinquency fees.
<br><br>If the obligor in non-IV-D cases enters into a written agreement for payment before the expiration of the 20-day period, the obligor must provide a copy of the signed written agreement to the depository or the clerk of the court.
<p>(2)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon petition filed by the obligor in the circuit court within 20 days after the mailing date of the notice, the court may, in its discretion, direct the department to issue a license for driving privileges restricted to business purposes only, as defined by s. 322.271, if the person is otherwise qualified for such a license. As a condition for the court to exercise its discretion under this subsection, the obligor must agree to a schedule of payment on any child support arrearages and to maintain current child support obligations. If the obligor fails to comply with the schedule of payment, the court shall direct the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to suspend the obligor's driver's license.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligor must serve a copy of the petition on the Title IV-D agency in IV-D cases or on the depository or the clerk of the court in non-IV-D cases. When an obligor timely files a petition to set aside a suspension, the court must hear the matter within 15 days after the petition is filed. The court must enter an order resolving the matter within 10 days after the hearing, and a copy of the order must be served on the parties. The timely filing of a petition under this subsection stays the intent to suspend until the entry of a court order resolving the matter.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the obligor does not, within 20 days after the mailing date on the notice, pay the delinquency, enter into a payment agreement, comply with the subpoena, order to appear, order to show cause, or other similar order, or file a motion to contest, the Title IV-D agency in IV-D cases, or the depository or clerk of the court in non-IV-D cases, shall file the notice with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and request the suspension of the obligor's driver's license and motor vehicle registration in accordance with s. 322.058.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligor may, within 20 days after the mailing date on the notice of delinquency or noncompliance and intent to suspend, file in the circuit court a petition to contest the notice of delinquency or noncompliance and intent to suspend on the ground of mistake of fact regarding the existence of a delinquency or the identity of the obligor. The obligor must serve a copy of the petition on the Title IV-D agency in IV-D cases or depository or clerk of the court in non-IV-D cases. When an obligor timely files a petition to contest, the court must hear the matter within 15 days after the petition is filed. The court must enter an order resolving the matter within 10 days after the hearing, and a copy of the order must be served on the parties. The timely filing of a petition to contest stays the notice of delinquency and intent to suspend until the entry of a court order resolving the matter.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedures prescribed in this section and s. 322.058 may be used to enforce compliance with an order to appear for genetic testing.

<p><b>61.1354&nbsp; Sharing of information between consumer reporting agencies and the IV-D agency.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of a request from a consumer reporting agency as defined in s. 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the IV-D agency or the depository in non-Title IV-D cases shall make available information relating to the amount of current and overdue support owed by an obligor. The IV-D agency or the depository in non-Title IV-D cases shall give the obligor written notice, at least 15 days prior to the release of information, of the IV-D agency's or depository's authority to release information to consumer reporting agencies relating to the amount of current and overdue support owed by the obligor. The obligor shall be informed of his or her right to request a hearing with the IV-D agency or the court in non-Title IV-D cases to contest the accuracy of the information.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The IV-D agency shall report periodically to appropriate consumer reporting agencies, as identified by the IV-D agency, the name and social security number of any delinquent obligor, the amount of overdue support owed by the obligor, and the amount of the obligor's current support obligation when the overdue support is paid. The IV-D agency, or its designee, shall provide the obligor with written notice, at least 15 days prior to the initial release of information, of the IV-D agency's authority to release the information periodically to the consumer reporting agencies. The notice shall state the amount of overdue support owed and the amount of current support owed when the overdue support is paid and shall inform the obligor of the right to request a hearing with the IV-D agency within 15 days after receipt of the notice to contest the accuracy of the information. After the initial notice is given, no further notice or opportunity for a hearing need be given when updated information concerning the same obligor is periodically released to the consumer reporting agencies.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of determining an individual's income and establishing an individual's capacity to make support payments or for determining the appropriate amount of child support payment to be made by the individual, consumer reporting agencies shall provide, upon request, consumer reports to the head of the IV-D agency pursuant to s. 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, provided that the head of the IV-D agency, or its designee, certifies that:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer report is needed for the purpose of determining an individual's income and establishing an individual's capacity to make support payments or determining the appropriate amount of child support payment to be made by the individual;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Paternity of the child of the individual whose report is sought, if that individual is the father of the child, has been established or acknowledged pursuant to the laws of Florida;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual whose report is sought was provided with at least 15 days' prior notice, by certified or registered mail to the individual's last known address, that the report was requested; and
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer report will be used solely for the purpose described in paragraph (a).
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of setting an initial or modified child support order, consumer reporting agencies shall provide, upon request, consumer reports to the IV-D agency.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Revenue is authorized to adopt rules necessary to implement this section.

<p><b>61.14&nbsp; Enforcement and modification of support, maintenance, or alimony agreements or orders.</b>--
<p>(1)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;When the parties enter into an agreement for payments for, or instead of, support, maintenance, or alimony, whether in connection with a proceeding for dissolution or separate maintenance or with any voluntary property settlement, or when a party is required by court order to make any payments, and the circumstances or the financial ability of either party changes or the child who is a beneficiary of an agreement or court order as described herein reaches majority after the execution of the agreement or the rendition of the order, either party may apply to the circuit court of the circuit in which the parties, or either of them, resided at the date of the execution of the agreement or reside at the date of the application, or in which the agreement was executed or in which the order was rendered, for an order decreasing or increasing the amount of support, maintenance, or alimony, and the court has jurisdiction to make orders as equity requires, with due regard to the changed circumstances or the financial ability of the parties or the child, decreasing, increasing, or confirming the amount of separate support, maintenance, or alimony provided for in the agreement or order. A finding that medical insurance is reasonably available or the child support guidelines schedule in s. 61.30 may constitute changed circumstances. Except as otherwise provided in s. 61.30(11)(c), the court may modify an order of support, maintenance, or alimony by increasing or decreasing the support, maintenance, or alimony retroactively to the date of the filing of the action or supplemental action for modification as equity requires, giving due regard to the changed circumstances or the financial ability of the parties or the child.
<p>(b)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may reduce or terminate an award of alimony upon specific written findings by the court that since the granting of a divorce and the award of alimony a supportive relationship has existed between the obligee and a person with whom the obligee resides. On the issue of whether alimony should be reduced or terminated under this paragraph, the burden is on the obligor to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a supportive relationship exists.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether an existing award of alimony should be reduced or terminated because of an alleged supportive relationship between an obligee and a person who is not related by consanguinity or affinity and with whom the obligee resides, the court shall elicit the nature and extent of the relationship in question. The court shall give consideration, without limitation, to circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following, in determining the relationship of an obligee to another person:
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which the obligee and the other person have held themselves out as a married couple by engaging in conduct such as using the same last name, using a common mailing address, referring to each other in terms such as "my husband" or "my wife," or otherwise conducting themselves in a manner that evidences a permanent supportive relationship.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of time that the obligee has resided with the other person in a permanent place of abode.
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which the obligee and the other person have pooled their assets or income or otherwise exhibited financial interdependence.
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which the obligee or the other person has supported the other, in whole or in part.
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which the obligee or the other person has performed valuable services for the other.
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which the obligee or the other person has performed valuable services for the other's company or employer.
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the obligee and the other person have worked together to create or enhance anything of value.
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the obligee and the other person have jointly contributed to the purchase of any real or personal property.
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence in support of a claim that the obligee and the other person have an express agreement regarding property sharing or support.
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence in support of a claim that the obligee and the other person have an implied agreement regarding property sharing or support.
<p>k.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the obligee and the other person have provided support to the children of one another, regardless of any legal duty to do so.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;This paragraph does not abrogate the requirement that every marriage in this state be solemnized under a license, does not recognize a common law marriage as valid, and does not recognize a de facto marriage. This paragraph recognizes only that relationships do exist that provide economic support equivalent to a marriage and that alimony terminable on remarriage may be reduced or terminated upon the establishment of equivalent equitable circumstances as described in this paragraph. The existence of a conjugal relationship, though it may be relevant to the nature and extent of the relationship, is not necessary for the application of the provisions of this paragraph.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;For each support order reviewed by the department as required by s. 409.2564(11), if the amount of the child support award under the order differs by at least 10 percent but not less than $25 from the amount that would be awarded under s. 61.30, the department shall seek to have the order modified and any modification shall be made without a requirement for proof or showing of a change in circumstances.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The department shall have authority to adopt rules to implement this section.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;When an order or agreement is modified pursuant to subsection (1), the party having an obligation to pay shall pay only the amount of support, maintenance, or alimony directed in the new order, and the agreement or earlier order is modified accordingly. No person may commence an action for modification of a support, maintenance, or alimony agreement or order except as herein provided. No court has jurisdiction to entertain any action to enforce the recovery of separate support, maintenance, or alimony other than as herein provided.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;This section is declaratory of existing public policy and of the laws of this state.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a party applies for a reduction of alimony or child support and the circumstances justify the reduction, the court may make the reduction of alimony or child support regardless of whether or not the party applying for it has fully paid the accrued obligations to the other party at the time of the application or at the time of the order of modification.
<p>(5)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;When a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order for the payment of alimony or child support or both, the court shall make a finding of the obligor's imputed or actual present ability to comply with the order. If the obligor subsequently fails to pay alimony or support and a contempt hearing is held, the original order of the court creates a presumption that the obligor has the present ability to pay the alimony or support and to purge himself or herself from the contempt. At the contempt hearing, the obligor shall have the burden of proof to show that he or she lacks the ability to purge himself or herself from the contempt. This presumption is adopted as a presumption under s. 90.302(2) to implement the public policy of this state that children shall be maintained from the resources of their parents and as provided for in s. 409.2551, and that spouses be maintained as provided for in s. 61.08. The court shall state in its order the reasons for granting or denying the contempt.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a proceeding in circuit court to enforce a support order under this chapter, chapter 88, chapter 409, or chapter 742, or any other provision of law, if the court finds that payments due under the support order are delinquent or overdue and that the obligor is unemployed, underemployed, or has no income but is able to work or participate in job training, the court may order the obligor to:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek employment.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;File periodic reports with the court, or with the department if the department is providing Title IV-D services, detailing the obligor's efforts to seek and obtain employment during the reporting period.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notify the court or the department, as appropriate, upon obtaining employment, income, or property.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Participate in job training, job placement, work experience, or other work programs that may be available pursuant to chapter 445, chapter 446, or any other source.
<br><br>An obligor who willfully fails to comply with a court order to seek work or participate in other work-related activities may be held in contempt of court. This paragraph is in furtherance of the public policy of the state of ensuring that children are maintained from the resources of their parents to the extent possible.
<p>(6)(a)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;When support payments are made through the local depository or through the State Disbursement Unit, any payment or installment of support which becomes due and is unpaid under any support order is delinquent; and this unpaid payment or installment, and all other costs and fees herein provided for, become, after notice to the obligor and the time for response as set forth in this subsection, a final judgment by operation of law, which has the full force, effect, and attributes of a judgment entered by a court in this state for which execution may issue. No deduction shall be made by the local depository from any payment made for costs and fees accrued in the judgment by operation of law process under paragraph (b) until the total amount of support payments due the obligee under the judgment has been paid.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A certified statement by the local depository evidencing a delinquency in support payments constitute evidence of the final judgment under this paragraph.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment under this paragraph is a final judgment as to any unpaid payment or installment of support which has accrued up to the time either party files a motion with the court to alter or modify the support order, and such judgment may not be modified by the court. The court may modify such judgment as to any unpaid payment or installment of support which accrues after the date of the filing of the motion to alter or modify the support order. This subparagraph does not prohibit the court from providing relief from the judgment pursuant to Rule 1.540, Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.
<p>(b)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an obligor is 15 days delinquent in making a payment or installment of support and the amount of the delinquency is greater than the periodic payment amount ordered by the court, the local depository shall serve notice on the obligor informing him or her of:
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The delinquency and its amount.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;An impending judgment by operation of law against him or her in the amount of the delinquency and all other amounts which thereafter become due and are unpaid, together with costs and a service charge of up to $25, for failure to pay the amount of the delinquency.
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligor's right to contest the impending judgment and the ground upon which such contest can be made.
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;The local depository's authority to release information regarding the delinquency to one or more credit reporting agencies.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The local depository shall serve the notice by mailing it by first class mail to the obligor at his or her last address of record with the local depository. If the obligor has no address of record with the local depository, service shall be by publication as provided in chapter 49.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When service of the notice is made by mail, service is complete on the date of mailing.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 15 days after service of the notice is complete, the obligor may file with the court that issued the support order, or with the court in the circuit where the local depository which served the notice is located, a motion to contest the impending judgment. An obligor may contest the impending judgment only on the ground of a mistake of fact regarding an error in whether a delinquency exists, in the amount of the delinquency, or in the identity of the obligor.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court shall hear the obligor's motion to contest the impending judgment within 15 days after the date of filing of the motion. Upon the court's denial of the obligor's motion, the amount of the delinquency and all other amounts that become due, together with costs and a service charge of up to $25, become a final judgment by operation of law against the obligor. The depository shall charge interest at the rate established in s. 55.03 on all judgments for support. Payments on judgments shall be applied first to the current child support due, then to any delinquent principal, and then to interest on the support judgment.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the obligor fails to file a motion to contest the impending judgment within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (c) and fails to pay the amount of the delinquency and all other amounts which thereafter become due, together with costs and a service charge of up to $25, such amounts become a final judgment by operation of law against the obligor at the expiration of the time for filing a motion to contest the impending judgment.
<p>(f)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of any person, the local depository shall issue, upon payment of a service charge of up to $25, a payoff statement of the total amount due under the judgment at the time of the request. The statement may be relied upon by the person for up to 30 days from the time it is issued unless proof of satisfaction of the judgment is provided.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the depository records show that the obligor's account is current, the depository shall record a satisfaction of the judgment upon request of any interested person and upon receipt of the appropriate recording fee. Any person shall be entitled to rely upon the recording of the satisfaction.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The local depository, at the direction of the department, or the obligee in a non-IV-D case, may partially release the judgment as to specific real property, and the depository shall record a partial release upon receipt of the appropriate recording fee.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The local depository is not liable for errors in its recordkeeping, except when an error is a result of unlawful activity or gross negligence by the clerk or his or her employees.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The local depository shall send the department monthly by electronic means a list of all Title IV-D and non-Title IV-D cases in which a judgment by operation of law has been recorded during the month for which the data is provided. At a minimum, the depository shall provide the names of the obligor and obligee, social security numbers of the obligor and obligee, if available, and depository number.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;When modification of an existing order of support is sought, the proof required to modify a settlement agreement and the proof required to modify an award established by court order shall be the same.
<p>(8)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee and an employer reach an agreement for a lump-sum settlement under s. 440.20(11), no proceeds of the settlement shall be disbursed to the employee, nor shall any attorney's fees be disbursed, until after a judge of compensation claims reviews the proposed disbursement and enters an order finding the settlement provides for appropriate recovery of any support arrearage. The employee, or the employee's attorney if the employee is represented, shall submit a written statement from the department that indicates whether the employee owes unpaid support and, if so, the amount owed. In addition, the judge of compensation claims may require the employee to submit a similar statement from a local depository established under s. 61.181. A sworn statement by the employee that all existing support obligations have been disclosed is also required. If the judge finds the proposed allocation of support recovery insufficient, the parties may amend the allocation of support recovery within the settlement agreement to make the allocation of proceeds sufficient. The Office of the Judges of Compensation Claims shall adopt procedural rules to implement this paragraph.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the provisions of s. 440.22, any compensation due or that may become due an employee under chapter 440 is exempt from garnishment, attachment, execution, and assignment of income, except for the purposes of enforcing child or spousal support obligations.
<p>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise ordered by the court or agreed to by the parties, the obligation to pay the current child support for that child is terminated when the child reaches 18 years of age or the disability of nonage is removed. The termination of the current child support obligation does not otherwise terminate the obligation to pay any arrearage, retroactive support, delinquency, or costs owed by the obligor.
<p>(10)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Title IV-D case, if an obligation to pay current child support is terminated due to the emancipation of the child and the obligor owes an arrearage, retroactive support, delinquency, or costs, the obligor shall continue to pay at the same rate in effect immediately prior to emancipation until all arrearages, retroactive support, delinquencies, and costs are paid in full or until the amount of the order is modified. Any income-deducted amount or amount paid by the obligor which is in excess of the obligation to pay current support shall be credited against the arrearages, retroactive support, delinquency, and costs owed by the obligor.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Title IV-D case, if an obligation to pay current child support for multiple children is reduced due to the emancipation of one child and the obligor owes an arrearage, retroactive support, delinquency, or costs, the obligor shall continue to pay at the same rate in effect immediately prior to emancipation until all arrearages, retroactive support, delinquencies, and costs are paid in full or until the amount of the order is modified. Any income-deducted amount or amount paid by the obligor which is in excess of the obligation to pay current support shall be credited against the arrearages, retroactive support, delinquency, and costs owed by the obligor. If an obligation to pay current support for more than one child is not reduced when a child is emancipated because the order does not allocate support per child, this paragraph does not apply.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide an additional remedy for collection of unpaid support and apply to cases in which a support order was entered before, on, or after July 1, 2004.
<p>(11)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;A court may, upon good cause shown, and without a showing of a substantial change of circumstances, modify, vacate, or set aside a temporary support order before or upon entering a final order in a proceeding.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The modification of the temporary support order may be retroactive to the date of the initial entry of the temporary support order; to the date of filing of the initial petition for dissolution of marriage, initial petition for support, initial petition determining paternity, or supplemental petition for modification; or to a date prescribed in paragraph (1)(a) or s. 61.30(11)(c) or (17), as applicable.

<p><b>61.16&nbsp; Attorney's fees, suit money, and costs.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may from time to time, after considering the financial resources of both parties, order a party to pay a reasonable amount for attorney's fees, suit money, and the cost to the other party of maintaining or defending any proceeding under this chapter, including enforcement and modification proceedings and appeals. In those cases in which an action is brought for enforcement and the court finds that the noncompliant party is without justification in the refusal to follow a court order, the court may not award attorney's fees, suit money, and costs to the noncompliant party. An application for attorney's fees, suit money, or costs, whether temporary or otherwise, shall not require corroborating expert testimony in order to support an award under this chapter. The trial court shall have continuing jurisdiction to make temporary attorney's fees and costs awards reasonably necessary to prosecute or defend an appeal on the same basis and criteria as though the matter were pending before it at the trial level. In all cases, the court may order that the amount be paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in that attorney's name. In determining whether to make attorney's fees and costs awards at the appellate level, the court shall primarily consider the relative financial resources of the parties, unless an appellate party's cause is deemed to be frivolous. In Title IV-D cases, attorney's fees, suit money, and costs, including filing fees, recording fees, mediation costs, service of process fees, and other expenses incurred by the clerk of the circuit court, shall be assessed only against the nonprevailing obligor after the court makes a determination of the nonprevailing obligor's ability to pay such costs and fees. The Department of Revenue shall not be considered a party for purposes of this section; however, fees may be assessed against the department pursuant to s. 57.105(1).
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;In an action brought pursuant to Rule 3.840, Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, whether denominated direct or indirect criminal contempt, the court shall have authority to:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Appoint an attorney to prosecute said contempt.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Assess attorney's fees and costs against the contemptor after the court makes a determination of the contemptor's ability to pay such costs and fees.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Order that the amount be paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in his or her name.

<p><b>61.17&nbsp; Alimony and child support; additional method for enforcing orders and judgments; costs, expenses.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;An order or judgment for the payment of alimony or child support or either entered by any court of this state may be enforced by another chancery court in this state in the following manner:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The person to whom such alimony or child support is payable or for whose benefit it is payable may procure a certified copy of the order or judgment and file it with a complaint for enforcement in the circuit court for the county in which the person resides or in the county where the person charged with the payment of the alimony or child support resides or is found.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the pleadings seek a change in the amount of the alimony or child support money, the court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the application and change the order or judgment. In such event the clerk of the circuit court in which the order is entered changing the original order or judgment shall transmit a certified copy thereof to the court of original jurisdiction, and the new order shall be recorded and filed in the original action and become a part thereof. If the pleadings ask for a modification of the order or judgment, the court may determine that the action should be tried by the court entering the original order or judgment and shall then transfer the action to that court for determination as a part of the original action.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforcement of a case certified under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act under this section shall grant to the registering court jurisdiction to address only those issues allowed and reimbursable under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court in which such an action is brought has jurisdiction to award costs and expenses as are equitable, including the cost of certifying and recording the judgment entered in the action in the court of original jurisdiction and reasonable attorney's fees.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry of a judgment for arrearages for child support, alimony, or attorney's fees and costs does not preclude a subsequent contempt proceeding or certification of a IV-D case for intercept, by the United States Internal Revenue Service, for failure of an obligor to pay the child support, alimony, attorney's fees, or costs for which the judgment was entered.

<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is a breach of the condition of any bond posted to ensure the payment of alimony or child support, either temporary or permanent, for a party or minor children of the parties, the court in which the order was issued may order payment to the party entitled thereto of the principal of the bond or the part thereof necessary to cure the existing default without further notice from time to time where the amount is liquidated.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The sureties on the bond, or the sheriff or clerk holding a cash bond, shall be ordered to pay into the registry of court, or to any party the court may direct, the sum necessary to cure the default.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principal or sureties or sheriff or clerk fails to pay within the time and as required by the order, the court may enforce the payment by contempt against the principal or sureties on the bond or sheriff or clerk without further notice, or may issue an execution against the principal, sureties, sheriff, or clerk for the amount unpaid under any prior order or orders, but no sureties on the bond are liable for more than the penalty of the bond.

<p><b>61.181&nbsp; Depository for alimony transactions, support, maintenance, and support payments; fees.</b>--
<p>(1)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The office of the clerk of the court shall operate a depository unless the depository is otherwise created by special act of the Legislature or unless, prior to June 1, 1985, a different entity was established to perform such functions. The department shall, no later than July 1, 1998, extend participation in the federal child support cost reimbursement program to the central depository in each county, to the maximum extent possible under existing federal law. The depository shall receive reimbursement for services provided under a cooperative agreement with the department pursuant to s. 61.1826. Each depository shall participate in the State Disbursement Unit and shall implement all statutory and contractual duties imposed on the State Disbursement Unit. Each depository shall receive from and transmit to the State Disbursement Unit required data through the Clerk of Court Child Support Enforcement Collection System. Payments on non-Title IV-D cases without income deduction orders shall not be sent to the State Disbursement Unit.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request by the department, the depository created pursuant to paragraph (a) shall establish an account for the receipt and disbursement of support payments for Title IV-D interstate cases. The department shall provide a copy of the other state's order with the request, and the depository shall advise the department of the account number in writing within 4 business days after receipt of the request.
<p>(2)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;For payments not required to be processed through the State Disbursement Unit, the depository shall impose and collect a fee on each payment made for receiving, recording, reporting, disbursing, monitoring, or handling alimony or child support payments as required under this section. For non-Title IV-D cases required to be processed by the State Disbursement Unit pursuant to this chapter, the State Disbursement Unit shall, on each payment received, collect a fee, and shall transmit to the depository in which the case is located 40 percent of such service charge for the depository's administration, management, and maintenance of such case. If a payment is made to the State Disbursement Unit which is not accompanied by the required fee, the State Disbursement Unit shall not deduct any moneys from the support payment for payment of the fee. The fee shall be a flat fee based, to the extent practicable, upon estimated reasonable costs of operation. The fee shall be reduced in any case in which the fixed fee results in a charge to any party of an amount greater than 3 percent of the amount of any support payment made in satisfaction of the amount which the party is obligated to pay, except that no fee shall be less than $1 nor more than $5 per payment made. The fee shall be considered by the court in determining the amount of support that the obligor is, or may be, required to pay.
<p>(b)1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fee imposed in paragraph (a) shall be increased to 4 percent of the support payments which the party is obligated to pay, except that no fee shall be more than $5.25. The fee shall be considered by the court in determining the amount of support that the obligor is, or may be, required to pay. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 145.022, 75 percent of the additional revenues generated by this paragraph shall be remitted monthly to the Clerk of the Court Child Support Enforcement Collection System Trust Fund administered by the department as provided in subparagraph 2. These funds shall be used exclusively for the development, implementation, and operation of the Clerk of the Court Child Support Enforcement Collection System to be operated by the depositories, including the automation of civil case information necessary for the State Case Registry. The department shall contract with the Florida Association of Court Clerks and the depositories to design, establish, operate, upgrade, and maintain the automation of the depositories to include, but not be limited to, the provision of online electronic transfer of information to the IV-D agency as otherwise required by this chapter. The department's obligation to fund the automation of the depositories is limited to the state share of funds available in the Clerk of the Court Child Support Enforcement Collection System Trust Fund. Each depository created under this section shall fully participate in the Clerk of the Court Child Support Enforcement Collection System and transmit data in a readable format as required by the contract between the Florida Association of Court Clerks and the department.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneys to be remitted to the department by the depository shall be done daily by electronic funds transfer and calculated as follows:
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;For each support payment of less than $33, 18.75 cents.
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;For each support payment between $33 and $140, an amount equal to 18.75 percent of the fee charged.
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;For each support payment in excess of $140, 18.75 cents.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees established by this section shall be set forth and included in every order of support entered by a court of this state which requires payment to be made into the depository.
<p>(3)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;For payments not required to be processed through the State Disbursement Unit, the depository shall collect and distribute all support payments paid into the depository to the appropriate party. On or after July 1, 1998, if a payment is made on a Title IV-D case which is not accompanied by the required transaction fee, the depository shall not deduct any moneys from the support payment for payment of the fee. Nonpayment of the required fee shall be considered a delinquency, and when the total of fees and costs which are due but not paid exceeds $50, the judgment by operation of law process set forth in s. 61.14(6)(a) shall become applicable and operational. As part of its collection and distribution functions, the depository shall maintain records listing:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligor's name, address, social security number, place of employment, and any other sources of income.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligee's name, address, and social security number.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of support due as provided in the court order.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule of payment as provided in the court order.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual amount of each support payment received, the date of receipt, the amount disbursed, and the recipient of the disbursement.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unpaid balance of any arrearage due as provided in the court order.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other records as necessary to comply with federal reporting requirements.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The depository may require a payor or obligor to complete an information form, which shall request the following about the payor or obligor who provides payment by check:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Full name, address, and home phone number.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Driver's license number.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Social security number.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Name, address, and business phone number of obligor's employer.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Date of birth.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weight and height.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such other information as may be required by the State Attorney if prosecution for an insufficient check becomes necessary.
<br><br>If the depository requests such information, and a payor or obligor does not comply, the depository may refuse to accept personal checks from the payor or obligor.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Parties using the depository for support payments shall inform the depository of changes in their names or addresses. An obligor shall, additionally, notify the depository of all changes in employment or sources of income, including the payor's name and address, and changes in the amounts of income received. Notification of all changes shall be made in writing to the depository within 7 days of a change.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;When time-sharing of a child is relinquished by a parent who is entitled to receive child support moneys from the depository to the custody of a licensed or registered long-term care child agency, that agency may request from the court an order directing child support payments that would otherwise be distributed to the parent be distributed to the agency for the period of time that the child is with the agency. Thereafter, payments shall be distributed to the agency as if the agency were the parent until further order of the court.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The depository shall provide to the IV-D agency, at least once a month, a listing of IV-D accounts which identifies all delinquent accounts, the period of delinquency, and total amount of delinquency. The list shall be in alphabetical order by name of obligor, shall include the obligee's name and case number, and shall be provided at no cost to the IV-D agency.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The depository shall accept a support payment tendered in the form of a check drawn on the account of a payor or obligor, unless the payor or obligor has previously remitted a check which was returned to the depository due to lack of sufficient funds in the account. If the payor or obligor has had a check returned for this reason, the depository shall accept payment by cash, cashier's check, or money order, or may accept a check upon deposit by the payor or obligor of an amount equal to 1 month's payment. Upon payment by cash, cashier's check, or money order, the depository shall disburse the proceeds to the obligee within 2 working days. Payments drawn by check on the account of a payor or obligor shall be disbursed within 4 working days. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 28.243, the administrator of the depository shall not be personally liable if the check tendered by the payor or obligor is not paid by the bank.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified copies of payment records maintained by a depository shall without further proof be admitted into evidence in any legal proceeding in this state.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;The depository shall provide to the Title IV-D agency the date provided by a payor, as required in s. 61.1301, for each payment received and forwarded to the agency. If no date is provided by the payor, the depository shall provide the date of receipt by the depository and shall report to the Title IV-D agency those payors who fail to provide the date the deduction was made.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before July 1, 1994, the depository shall provide information required by this chapter to be transmitted to the Title IV-D agency by online electronic transmission pursuant to rules promulgated by the Title IV-D agency.
<p>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the increase in fees as provided by paragraph (2)(b) expires or is otherwise terminated, the depository shall not be required to provide the Title IV-D agency the date provided by a payor as required by s. 61.1301.

<p><b>61.1824&nbsp; State Disbursement Unit.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Disbursement Unit is hereby created and shall be operated by the Department of Revenue or by a contractor responsible directly to the department. The State Disbursement Unit shall be responsible for the collection and disbursement of payments for:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;All support cases enforced by the department pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act; and
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;All child support cases not being enforced by the department pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act in which the initial support order was issued in this state on or after January 1, 1994, and in which the obligor's child support obligation is being paid through income deduction.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Disbursement Unit must be operated in coordination with the department's child support enforcement automated system in Title IV-D cases.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Disbursement Unit shall perform the following functions:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Disburse all receipts from intercepts, including, but not limited to, United States Internal Revenue Service, unemployment compensation, lottery, and administrative offset intercepts.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide employers and payors with one address to which all income deduction collections are sent.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is more than one income deduction order being enforced against the same obligor by the payor, allocate the amounts available for income deduction in the manner set forth in s. 61.1301.
<p><SUP>1</SUP>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent feasible, use automated procedures for the collection and disbursement of support payments, including, but not limited to, having procedures for:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipt of payments from obligors, employers, other states and jurisdictions, and other entities.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Timely disbursement of payments to obligees, the department, and other state Title IV-D agencies.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurate identification of payment source and amount.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furnishing any parent, upon request, timely information on the current status of support payments under an order requiring payments to be made by or to the parent, except that in cases described in paragraph (1)(b), prior to the date the State Disbursement Unit becomes fully operational, the State Disbursement Unit shall not be required to convert and maintain in automated form records of payments kept pursuant to s. 61.181.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic disbursement of support payments to obligees. The State Disbursement Unit shall notify obligees of electronic disbursement options. Any payments made to the State Disbursement Unit that are owed to the obligee shall be disbursed electronically. The obligee may designate a personal account for deposit of payments. If the obligee does not designate a personal account, the State Disbursement Unit shall deposit any payments into a stored value account that can be accessed by the obligee.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Information regarding disbursement must be transmitted in the following manner:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Title IV-D cases, the State Disbursement Unit shall transmit, in an electronic format as prescribed by the department, all required information to the department on the same business day the information is received from the employer or other source of periodic income, if sufficient information identifying the payee is provided. The department shall determine distribution allocation of a collection and shall electronically transmit that information to the State Disbursement Unit, whereupon the State Disbursement Unit shall disburse the collection. The State Disbursement Unit may delay the disbursement of payments toward arrearages until the resolution of any timely appeal with respect to such arrearages. The State Disbursement Unit may delay the disbursement of Title IV-D collections until authorization by the Title IV-D agency has been received.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In non-Title IV-D cases, payment information is not transmitted to the department. The State Disbursement Unit may delay the disbursement of payments toward arrearages until the resolution of any timely appeal with respect to such arrearages.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconcile all cash receipts and all disbursements daily and provide the department with a daily reconciliation report in a format as prescribed by the department.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;Disburse support payments to foreign countries as may be required.
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive and convert support payments made in foreign currency.
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Remit to the department payments for costs due the department.
<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;Handle insufficient funds payments, claims of lost or stolen checks, and stop payment orders.
<p>(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue billing notices and statements of account, in accordance with federal requirements, in a format and frequency prescribed by the department to persons who pay and receive child support in Title IV-D cases.
<p>(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide the department with a weekly report that summarizes and totals all financial transaction activity.
<p>(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide toll-free access to customer assistance representatives and an automated voice response system that will enable the parties to a support case to obtain payment information.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;For cases in which the obligor or payor fails to submit payment directly to the central address provided by the State Disbursement Unit, the depositories shall have procedures for accepting a support payment tendered in the form of cash or a check drawn on the account of a payor or obligor, unless the payor or obligor has previously remitted a check which was returned to the depository due to lack of sufficient funds in the account. If the payor or obligor has had a check returned for this reason, the depository shall accept payment by cash, cashier's check, or money order, or may accept a check upon deposit by the payor or obligor of an amount equal to 1 month's payment. Upon payment by cash, cashier's check, or money order, the depository shall remit the payment to the State Disbursement Unit within 1 business day after receipt.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Obligees receiving payments through the State Disbursement Unit shall inform the State Disbursement Unit of changes in their names and addresses. Notification of all changes must be made directly to the State Disbursement Unit within 7 business days after a change. In Title IV-D cases, the State Disbursement Unit shall transmit the information to the department, in an electronic format prescribed by the department, within 1 business day after receipt.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;All support payments for cases to which the requirements of this section apply shall be made payable to and delivered to the State Disbursement Unit.
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer that is required to remit tax payments electronically to the department under s. 213.755 or s. 443.163 shall remit support payments deducted pursuant to an income deduction order or income deduction notice and provide associated case data to the State Disbursement Unit by electronic means approved by the department. The department may waive the requirement to remit payments electronically for an employer that is unable to comply despite good faith efforts or due to circumstances beyond the employer's reasonable control. Grounds for approving a waiver include, but are not limited to, circumstances in which:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The employer does not have a computer that meets the minimum standards necessary for electronic remittance.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional time is needed to program the employer's computer.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The employer does not currently file data electronically with any business or government agency.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance conflicts with the employer's business procedures.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance would cause a financial hardship.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The department shall adopt by rule standards for electronic remittance, data transfer, and waivers that, to the extent feasible, are consistent with the department's rules for electronic filing and remittance of taxes under ss. 213.755 and 443.163. A waiver granted by the department from the requirement to file and remit electronically under s. 213.755 or s. 443.163 constitutes a waiver from the requirement under this subsection.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other statutory provision to the contrary, funds received by the State Disbursement Unit shall be held, administered, and disbursed by the State Disbursement Unit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 1, 1998, each support order established or modified in the state on or after October 1, 1998, in which services are not being provided by the Title IV-D agency.
<br><br>The department shall maintain that part of the State Case Registry that includes support order information for Title IV-D cases on the department's child support enforcement automated system.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 1, 1998, for each support order established or modified by a court of this state on or after October 1, 1998, the depository for the court that enters the support order in a non-Title IV-D case shall provide, in an electronic format prescribed by the department, the following information to that component of the State Case Registry that receives, maintains, and transmits support order information for non-Title IV-D cases:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of the obligor, obligee, and child or children;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The social security numbers of the obligor, obligee, and child or children;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The dates of birth of the obligor, obligee, and child or children;

<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal information processing system numeric designation for the county and state where the support order was established or modified; and
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other data as may be required by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.
<p>(3)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this section, a family violence indicator must be placed on a record when:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A party executes a sworn statement requesting that a family violence indicator be placed on that party's record which states that the party has reason to believe that release of information to the Federal Case Registry may result in physical or emotional harm to the party or the child; or

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The department has received information on a Title IV-D case from the Domestic Violence and Repeat Violence Injunction Statewide Verification System, established pursuant to s. 784.046(8)(b), that a court has granted a party a domestic violence or repeat violence injunction.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the family violence indicator can be removed from a record, the protected person must be afforded notice and an opportunity to appear before the court on the issue of whether the disclosure will result in harm.

<p><b>61.1826&nbsp; Procurement of services for State Disbursement Unit and the non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry; contracts and cooperative agreements; penalties; withholding payment.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.--The Legislature finds that the clerks of court play a vital role, as essential participants in the establishment, modification, collection, and enforcement of child support, in securing the health, safety, and welfare of the children of this state. The Legislature further finds and declares that:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the state's best interest to preserve the essential role of the clerks of court in disbursing child support payments and maintaining official records of child support orders entered by the courts of this state.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;As official recordkeeper for matters relating to court-ordered child support, the clerks of court are necessary parties to obtaining, safeguarding, and providing child support payment and support order information.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;As provided by the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, the state must establish and operate a State Case Registry in full compliance with federal law by October 1, 1998, and a State Disbursement Unit by October 1, 1999.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Noncompliance with federal law could result in a substantial loss of federal funds for the state's child support enforcement program and the temporary assistance for needy families welfare block grant.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential loss of substantial federal funds poses a direct and immediate threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the children and citizens of the state and constitutes an emergency for purposes of s. 287.057(5)(a).
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerks of court maintain the official payment record of the court for amounts received, payments credited, arrearages owed, liens attached, and current mailing addresses of all parties, payor, obligor, and payee.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerks of court have established a statewide Clerk of Court Child Support Enforcement Collection System for the automation of all payment processing using state and local government funds as provided under s. 61.181(2)(b)1.
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legislature acknowledges the improvements made by and the crucial role of the Clerk of the Court Child Support Enforcement Collection System in speeding payments to the children of Florida.
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no viable alternative to continuing the role of the clerks of court in collecting, safeguarding, and providing essential child support payment information.
<br><br>For these reasons, the Legislature hereby directs the Department of Revenue, subject to the provisions of subsection (5), to contract with the Florida Association of Court Clerks and each depository to perform duties with respect to the operation and maintenance of a State Disbursement Unit and the non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry as further provided by this section.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.--Each depository shall enter into a standard cooperative agreement with the department for participation in the State Disbursement Unit and the non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry through the Clerk of Court Child Support Enforcement Collection System within 60 days after the effective date of this section. The cooperative agreement shall be a uniform document, mutually developed by the department and the Florida Association of Court Clerks, that applies to all depositories and complies with all state and federal requirements. Each depository shall also enter into a written agreement with the Florida Association of Court Clerks and the department within 60 days after the effective date of this section that requires each depository to participate fully in the State Disbursement Unit and the non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTRACT.--The Florida Association of Court Clerks shall enter into a written contract with the department that fully complies with all federal and state laws within 60 days after the effective date of this section. The contract shall be mutually developed by the department and the Florida Association of Court Clerks. As required by s. 287.057 and 45 C.F.R. s. 74.43, any subcontracts entered into by the Florida Association of Court Clerks, except for a contract between the Florida Association of Court Clerks and its totally owned subsidiary corporation, must be procured through competitive bidding.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT AND CONTRACT TERMS.--The contract between the Florida Association of Court Clerks and the department, and cooperative agreements entered into by the depositories and the department, must contain, but are not limited to, the following terms:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial term of the contract and cooperative agreements is for 5 years. The subsequent term of the contract and cooperative agreements is for 3 years, with the option of two 1-year renewal periods, at the sole discretion of the department.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties and responsibilities of the Florida Association of Court Clerks, the depositories, and the department.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Under s. 287.058(1)(a), all providers and subcontractors shall submit to the department directly, or through the Florida Association of Court Clerks, a report of monthly expenditures in a format prescribed by the department and in sufficient detail for a proper preaudit and postaudit thereof.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;All providers and subcontractors shall submit to the department directly, or through the Florida Association of Court Clerks, management reports in a format prescribed by the department.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;All subcontractors shall comply with chapter 280, as may be required.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal financial participation for eligible Title IV-D expenditures incurred by the Florida Association of Court Clerks and the depositories shall be at the maximum level permitted by federal law for expenditures incurred for the provision of services in support of child support enforcement in accordance with 45 C.F.R. part 74 and Federal Office of Management and Budget Circulars A-87 and A-122 and based on an annual cost allocation study of each depository. The depositories shall submit directly, or through the Florida Association of Court Clerks, claims for Title IV-D expenditures monthly to the department in a standardized format as prescribed by the department. The Florida Association of Court Clerks shall contract with a certified public accounting firm, selected by the Florida Association of Court Clerks and the department, to audit and certify quarterly to the department all claims for expenditures submitted by the depositories for Title IV-D reimbursement.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the contracts between the department and the Florida Association of Court Clerks or the depositories, the Florida Association of Court Clerks, its agents, and the depositories shall assist the department in making an orderly transition to a private vendor.
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest on late payment by the department shall be in accordance with s. 215.422.
<br><br>If either the department or the Florida Association of Court Clerks objects to a term of the standard cooperative agreement or contract specified in subsections (2) and (3), the disputed term or terms shall be presented jointly by the parties to the Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee, who shall act as special magistrate. The special magistrate shall resolve the dispute in writing within 10 days. The resolution of a dispute by the special magistrate is binding on the department and the Florida Association of Court Clerks.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTRACT TERMINATION.--If any of the following events occur, the department may discontinue its plans to contract, or terminate its contract, with the Florida Association of Court Clerks and the depositories upon 30 days' written notice by the department and may, through competitive bidding, procure services from a private vendor to perform functions necessary for the department to operate the State Disbursement Unit and the non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry with a minimum amount of disruption in service to the children and citizens of the state:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipt by the department of final notice by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services or the secretary's designee that the contractual arrangement between the department, the Florida Association of Court Clerks, and the depositories does not satisfy federal requirements for a State Disbursement Unit or a State Case Registry and that the state's Title IV-D State Plan will not be approved, or that federal Title IV-D funding is not made available to fund the non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry or the State Disbursement Unit;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Florida Association of Court Clerks, a depository, or any subcontractor fails to comply with any material contractual term or state or federal requirement;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry is not established and operational, consistent with the terms of the contract, by October 1, 1998; or
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Disbursement Unit is not established and operational, consistent with the terms of the contract, by October 1, 1999.
<br><br>If either event specified in paragraph (a) occurs, the depositories are relieved of all responsibilities and duties under this chapter relating to Title IV-D payment processing and data transmission to the department.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;PARTICIPATION BY DEPOSITORIES.--
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each depository shall participate in the non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry by using an automated system compatible with the department's automated child support enforcement system.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;For participation in the State Disbursement Unit, each depository shall:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the CLERC System;
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive electronically and record payment information from the State Disbursement Unit for each support order entered by the court.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE IV-D PROGRAM INCOME.--Pursuant to 45 C.F.R. s. 304.50, all transaction fees and interest income realized by the State Disbursement Unit constitute and must be reported as program income under federal law and must be transmitted to the Title IV-D agency for deposit in the Child Support Enforcement Application and Program Revenue Trust Fund.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;PENALTIES.--All depositories must participate in the State Disbursement Unit and the non-Title IV-D component of the State Case Registry as provided in this chapter. If, after notice and an opportunity to cure an otherwise curable default, a depository fails to comply with the material terms of the cooperative agreement, the failure to comply subjects the county officer or officers responsible for the depository to the sanctions provided in Art. IV of the State Constitution. However, no county officer or officers shall be subject to sanctions under Art. IV of the State Constitution for any noncurable default resulting from circumstances or conditions outside the control of the depository.
<p>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;WITHHOLDING PAYMENT UNDER CONTRACTS.--If the Florida Association of Court Clerks, its agent, a subcontractor, or a depository does not comply with any material contractual term or state or federal requirement, the department may withhold funds otherwise due under the individual contract with the Florida Association of Court Clerks or the individual cooperative agreement with the depository, or both, at the department's election, to enforce compliance. The department shall provide written notice of noncompliance before withholding funds. Within 10 business days after receipt of written notification of noncompliance, the department must be provided with a written proposed corrective action plan. Within 10 business days after receipt of a corrective action plan, the department shall accept the plan or allow 5 business days within which a revised plan may be submitted. Upon the department's acceptance of a corrective action plan, the agreed-upon plan must be fully completed within 30 business days unless a longer period is permitted by the department. If a proposed corrective action plan is not submitted, is not accepted, or is not fully completed, any funds withheld by the department for noncompliance are forfeited to the department. Withholding or forfeiture of funds may be contested by filing a petition or request for a hearing under the applicable provisions of chapter 120. For the purposes of this section, no party to a dispute involving less than $5,000 in withheld or forfeited funds is deemed to be substantially affected by the dispute or to have a substantial interest in the decision resolving the dispute.

<p><b>61.21&nbsp; Parenting course authorized; fees; required attendance authorized; contempt.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; PURPOSE.--It is the finding of the Legislature that:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of children experience the separation or divorce of their parents each year. Parental conflict related to divorce is a societal concern because children suffer potential short-term and long-term detrimental economic, emotional, and educational effects during this difficult period of family transition. This is particularly true when parents engage in lengthy legal conflict.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are more likely to consider the best interests of their children when determining parental arrangements if courts provide families with information regarding the process by which courts make decisions on issues affecting their children and suggestions as to how parents may ease the coming adjustments in family structure for their children.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found to be beneficial to parents who are separating or divorcing to have available an educational program that will provide general information regarding:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues and legal procedures for resolving time-sharing and child support disputes.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The emotional experiences and problems of divorcing adults.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The family problems and the emotional concerns and needs of the children.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of community services and resources.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents who are separating or divorcing are more likely to receive maximum benefit from a program if they attend such program at the earliest stages of their dispute, before extensive litigation occurs and adversarial positions are assumed or intensified.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Children and Family Services shall approve a parenting course which shall be a course of a minimum of 4 hours designed to educate, train, and assist divorcing parents in regard to the consequences of divorce on parents and children.
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The parenting course referred to in this section shall be named the Parent Education and Family Stabilization Course and may include, but need not be limited to, the following topics as they relate to court actions between parents involving custody, care, visitation, and support of a child or children:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal aspects of deciding child-related issues between parents.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotional aspects of separation and divorce on adults.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotional aspects of separation and divorce on children.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Family relationships and family dynamics.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial responsibilities to a child or children.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues regarding spousal or child abuse and neglect.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Skill-based relationship education that may be generalized to parenting, workplace, school, neighborhood, and civic relationships.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Information regarding spousal and child abuse and neglect shall be included in every parent education and family stabilization course. A list of local agencies that provide assistance with such issues shall also be provided.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent education and family stabilization course shall be educational in nature and shall not be designed to provide individual mental health therapy for parents or children, or individual legal advice to parents or children.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Course providers shall not solicit participants from the sessions they conduct to become private clients or patients.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Course providers shall not give individual legal advice or mental health therapy.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each course provider offering a parenting course pursuant to this section must be approved by the Department of Children and Family Services.
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Children and Family Services shall provide each judicial circuit with a list of approved course providers and sites at which the parent education and family stabilization course may be completed. Each judicial circuit must make information regarding all course providers approved for their circuit available to all parents.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Children and Family Services shall include on the list of approved course providers and sites for each circuit at least one site in that circuit where the parent education and family stabilization course may be completed on a sliding fee scale, if available.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Children and Family Services shall include on the list of approved course providers, without limitation as to the area of the state for which the course is approved, a minimum of one statewide approved course to be provided through the Internet and one statewide approved course to be provided through correspondence. The purpose of the Internet and correspondence courses is to ensure that the parent education and stabilization course is available in the home county of each state resident and to those out-of-state persons subject to this section.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Children and Family Services may remove a provider who violates this section, or its implementing rules, from the list of approved court providers.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Children and Family Services shall adopt rules to administer subsection (2) and this subsection.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties to a dissolution of marriage proceeding with minor children or a paternity action that involves issues of parental responsibility shall be required to complete the Parent Education and Family Stabilization Course prior to the entry by the court of a final judgment. The court may excuse a party from attending the parenting course, or from completing the course within the required time, for good cause.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties required to complete a parenting course under this section shall begin the course as expeditiously as possible. For dissolution of marriage actions, unless excused by the court pursuant to subsection (4), the petitioner must complete the course within 45 days after the filing of the petition, and all other parties must complete the course within 45 days after service of the petition. For paternity actions, unless excused by the court pursuant to subsection (4), the petitioner must complete the course within 45 days after filing the petition, and any other party must complete the course within 45 days after an acknowledgment of paternity by that party, an adjudication of paternity of that party, or an order granting visitation to or support from that party. Each party to a dissolution or paternity action shall file proof of compliance with this subsection with the court prior to the entry of the final judgment.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties to a modification of a final judgment involving a parenting plan or a time-sharing schedule may be required to complete a court-approved parenting course prior to the entry of an order modifying the final judgment.
<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable fee may be charged to each parent attending the course.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;Information obtained or statements made by the parties at any educational session required under this statute shall not be considered in the adjudication of a pending or subsequent action, nor shall any report resulting from such educational session become part of the record of the case unless the parties have stipulated in writing to the contrary.
<p>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may hold any parent who fails to attend a required parenting course in contempt, or that parent may be denied shared parental responsibility or visitation or otherwise sanctioned as the court deems appropriate.
<p>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the parties to a dissolution of marriage to attend a court-approved parenting course together.
<p>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may, without motion of either party, prohibit the parenting course from being taken together, if there is a history of domestic violence between the parties.

<p><b>61.30&nbsp; Child support guidelines; retroactive child support.</b>--
<p>(1)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The child support guideline amount as determined by this section presumptively establishes the amount the trier of fact shall order as child support in an initial proceeding for such support or in a proceeding for modification of an existing order for such support, whether the proceeding arises under this or another chapter. The trier of fact may order payment of child support which varies, plus or minus 5 percent, from the guideline amount, after considering all relevant factors, including the needs of the child or children, age, station in life, standard of living, and the financial status and ability of each parent. The trier of fact may order payment of child support in an amount which varies more than 5 percent from such guideline amount only upon a written finding explaining why ordering payment of such guideline amount would be unjust or inappropriate. Notwithstanding the variance limitations of this section, the trier of fact shall order payment of child support which varies from the guideline amount as provided in paragraph (11)(b) whenever any of the children are required by court order or mediation agreement to spend a substantial amount of time with either parent. This requirement applies to any living arrangement, whether temporary or permanent.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidelines may provide the basis for proving a substantial change in circumstances upon which a modification of an existing order may be granted. However, the difference between the existing monthly obligation and the amount provided for under the guidelines shall be at least 15 percent or $50, whichever amount is greater, before the court may find that the guidelines provide a substantial change in circumstances.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;For each support order reviewed by the department as required by s. 409.2564(11), if the amount of the child support award under the order differs by at least 10 percent but not less than $25 from the amount that would be awarded under s. 61.30, the department shall seek to have the order modified and any modification shall be made without a requirement for proof or showing of a change in circumstances.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Income shall be determined on a monthly basis for each parent as follows:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross income shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary or wages.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonuses, commissions, allowances, overtime, tips, and other similar payments.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Business income from sources such as self-employment, partnership, close corporations, and independent contracts. "Business income" means gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses required to produce income.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability benefits.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;All workers' compensation benefits and settlements.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment compensation.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pension, retirement, or annuity payments.
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Social security benefits.
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spousal support received from a previous marriage or court ordered in the marriage before the court.
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and dividends.
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rental income, which is gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses required to produce the income.
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Income from royalties, trusts, or estates.
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimbursed expenses or in kind payments to the extent that they reduce living expenses.
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gains derived from dealings in property, unless the gain is nonrecurring.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Income on a monthly basis shall be imputed to an unemployed or underemployed parent when such employment or underemployment is found by the court to be voluntary on that parent's part, absent a finding of fact by the court of physical or mental incapacity or other circumstances over which the parent has no control. In the event of such voluntary unemployment or underemployment, the employment potential and probable earnings level of the parent shall be determined based upon his or her recent work history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing earnings level in the community as provided in this paragraph; however, the court may refuse to impute income to a parent if the court finds it necessary for the parent to stay home with the child who is the subject of a child support calculation.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Public assistance as defined in s. 409.2554 shall be excluded from gross income.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Net income is obtained by subtracting allowable deductions from gross income. Allowable deductions shall include:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal, state, and local income tax deductions, adjusted for actual filing status and allowable dependents and income tax liabilities.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal insurance contributions or self-employment tax.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory union dues.
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory retirement payments.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Health insurance payments, excluding payments for coverage of the minor child.
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Court-ordered support for other children which is actually paid.
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;Spousal support paid pursuant to a court order from a previous marriage or the marriage before the court.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Net income for each parent shall be computed by subtracting allowable deductions from gross income.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Net income for each parent shall be added together for a combined net income.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The following guidelines schedule shall be applied to the combined net income to determine the minimum child support need:

<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;Child care costs incurred on behalf of the children due to employment, job search, or education calculated to result in employment or to enhance income of current employment of either parent shall be reduced by 25 percent and then shall be added to the basic obligation. After the adjusted child care costs are added to the basic obligation, any moneys prepaid by a parent for child care costs for the child or children of this action shall be deducted from that parent's child support obligation for that child or those children. Child care costs shall not exceed the level required to provide quality care from a licensed source for the children.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;Health insurance costs resulting from coverage ordered pursuant to s. 61.13(1)(b), and any noncovered medical, dental, and prescription medication expenses of the child, shall be added to the basic obligation unless these expenses have been ordered to be separately paid on a percentage basis. After the health insurance costs are added to the basic obligation, any moneys prepaid by a parent for health-related costs for the child or children of this action shall be deducted from that parent's child support obligation for that child or those children.
<p>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each parent's percentage share of the child support need shall be determined by dividing each parent's net monthly income by the combined net monthly income.
<p>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each parent's actual dollar share of the total minimum child support need shall be determined by multiplying the minimum child support need by each parent's percentage share of the combined monthly net income.
<p>(11)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may adjust the total minimum child support award, or either or both parents' share of the total minimum child support award, based upon the following deviation factors:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Extraordinary medical, psychological, educational, or dental expenses.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent income of the child, not to include moneys received by a child from supplemental security income.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of support for a parent which regularly has been paid and for which there is a demonstrated need.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seasonal variations in one or both parents' incomes or expenses.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The age of the child, taking into account the greater needs of older children.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Special needs, such as costs that may be associated with the disability of a child, that have traditionally been met within the family budget even though the fulfilling of those needs will cause the support to exceed the presumptive amount established by the guidelines.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Total available assets of the obligee, obligor, and the child.
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the Internal Revenue Service dependency exemption and waiver of that exemption. The court may order a parent to execute a waiver of the Internal Revenue Service dependency exemption if the paying parent is current in support payments.
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;When application of the child support guidelines schedule requires a person to pay another person more than 55 percent of his or her gross income for a child support obligation for current support resulting from a single support order.
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular parenting plan, such as where the child spends a significant amount of time, but less than 40 percent of the overnights, with one parent, thereby reducing the financial expenditures incurred by the other parent; or the refusal of a parent to become involved in the activities of the child.
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other adjustment which is needed to achieve an equitable result which may include, but not be limited to, a reasonable and necessary existing expense or debt. Such expense or debt may include, but is not limited to, a reasonable and necessary expense or debt which the parties jointly incurred during the marriage.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a particular parenting plan provides that each child spend a substantial amount of time with each parent, the court shall adjust any award of child support, as follows:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with subsections (9) and (10), calculate the amount of support obligation apportioned to each parent without including day care and health insurance costs in the calculation and multiply the amount by 1.5.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculate the percentage of overnight stays the child spends with each parent.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiply each parent's support obligation as calculated in subparagraph 1. by the percentage of the other parent's overnight stays with the child as calculated in subparagraph 2.
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the amounts calculated in subparagraph 3. shall be the monetary transfer necessary between the parents for the care of the child, subject to an adjustment for day care and health insurance expenses.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to subsections (7) and (8), calculate the net amounts owed by each parent for the expenses incurred for day care and health insurance coverage for the child. Day care shall be calculated without regard to the 25-percent reduction applied by subsection (7).
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust the support obligation owed by each parent pursuant to subparagraph 4. by crediting or debiting the amount calculated in subparagraph 5. This amount represents the child support which must be exchanged between the parents.
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may deviate from the child support amount calculated pursuant to subparagraph 6. based upon the deviation factors in paragraph (a), as well as the obligee parent's low income and ability to maintain the basic necessities of the home for the child, the likelihood that either parent will actually exercise the time-sharing schedule set forth in the parenting plan granted by the court, and whether all of the children are exercising the same time-sharing schedule.
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of adjusting any award of child support under this paragraph, "substantial amount of time" means that a parent exercises visitation at least 40 percent of the overnights of the year.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent's failure to regularly exercise the court-ordered or agreed time-sharing schedule not caused by the other parent which resulted in the adjustment of the amount of child support pursuant to subparagraph (a)10. or paragraph (b) shall be deemed a substantial change of circumstances for purposes of modifying the child support award. A modification pursuant to this paragraph shall be retroactive to the date the noncustodial parent first failed to regularly exercise the court-ordered or agreed time-sharing schedule.
<p>(12)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with a support obligation may have other children living with him or her who were born or adopted after the support obligation arose. If such subsequent children exist, the court, when considering an upward modification of an existing award, may disregard the income from secondary employment obtained in addition to the parent's primary employment if the court determines that the employment was obtained primarily to support the subsequent children.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in paragraph (a), the existence of such subsequent children should not as a general rule be considered by the court as a basis for disregarding the amount provided in the guidelines schedule. The parent with a support obligation for subsequent children may raise the existence of such subsequent children as a justification for deviation from the guidelines schedule. However, if the existence of such subsequent children is raised, the income of the other parent of the subsequent children shall be considered by the court in determining whether or not there is a basis for deviation from the guideline amount.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of subsequent children under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) may only be raised in a proceeding for an upward modification of an existing award and may not be applied to justify a decrease in an existing award.
<p>(13)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the recurring income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the child, the court may order child support to be paid from nonrecurring income or assets.
<p>(14)&nbsp;&nbsp;Every petition for child support or for modification of child support shall be accompanied by an affidavit which shows the party's income, allowable deductions, and net income computed in accordance with this section. The affidavit shall be served at the same time that the petition is served. The respondent, whether or not a stipulation is entered, shall make an affidavit which shows the party's income, allowable deductions, and net income computed in accordance with this section. The respondent shall include his or her affidavit with the answer to the petition or as soon thereafter as is practicable, but in any case at least 72 hours prior to any hearing on the finances of either party.
<p>(15)&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of establishing an obligation for support in accordance with this section, if a person who is receiving public assistance is found to be noncooperative as defined in s. 409.2572, the IV-D agency is authorized to submit to the court an affidavit attesting to the income of that parent based upon information available to the IV-D agency.
<p>(16)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legislature shall review the guidelines schedule established in this section at least every 4 years beginning in 1997.
<p>(17)&nbsp;&nbsp;In an initial determination of child support, whether in a paternity action, dissolution of marriage action, or petition for support during the marriage, the court has discretion to award child support retroactive to the date when the parents did not reside together in the same household with the child, not to exceed a period of 24 months preceding the filing of the petition, regardless of whether that date precedes the filing of the petition. In determining the retroactive award in such cases, the court shall consider the following:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court shall apply the guidelines schedule in effect at the time of the hearing subject to the obligor's demonstration of his or her actual income, as defined by subsection (2), during the retroactive period. Failure of the obligor to so demonstrate shall result in the court using the obligor's income at the time of the hearing in computing child support for the retroactive period.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;All actual payments made by a parent to the other parent or the child or third parties for the benefit of the child throughout the proposed retroactive period.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court should consider an installment payment plan for the payment of retroactive child support.

<p><b>61.45&nbsp; Court-ordered parenting plan; risk of violation; bond.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In any proceeding in which the court enters a parenting plan, including a time-sharing schedule, including in a modification proceeding, upon the presentation of competent substantial evidence that there is a risk that one party may violate the court's parenting plan by removing a child from this state or country or by concealing the whereabouts of a child, or upon stipulation of the parties, the court may:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Order that a parent may not remove the child from this state without the notarized written permission of both parents or further court order;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Order that a parent may not remove the child from this country without the notarized written permission of both parents or further court order;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Order that a parent may not take the child to a country that has not ratified or acceded to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction unless the other parent agrees in writing that the child may be taken to the country;
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Require a parent to surrender the passport of the child; or
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Require that party to post bond or other security.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the court enters a parenting plan, including a time-sharing schedule, including in a modification proceeding, that includes a provision entered under paragraph (1)(b) or paragraph (1)(c), a certified copy of the order should be sent by the parent who requested the restriction to the Passport Services Office of the United States Department of State requesting that they not issue a passport to the child without their signature or further court order.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the need for a bond or other security, the court may consider any reasonable factor bearing upon the risk that a party may violate a parenting plan by removing a child from this state or country or by concealing the whereabouts of a child, including but not limited to whether:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;A court has previously found that a party previously removed a child from Florida or another state in violation of a parenting plan, or whether a court had found that a party has threatened to take a child out of Florida or another state in violation of a parenting plan;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The party has strong family and community ties to Florida or to other states or countries, including whether the party or child is a citizen of another country;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The party has strong financial reasons to remain in Florida or to relocate to another state or country;
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The party has engaged in activities that suggest plans to leave Florida, such as quitting employment; sale of a residence or termination of a lease on a residence, without efforts to acquire an alternative residence in the state; closing bank accounts or otherwise liquidating assets; or applying for a passport;
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party has had a history of domestic violence as either a victim or perpetrator, child abuse or child neglect evidenced by criminal history, including but not limited to, arrest, an injunction for protection against domestic violence issued after notice and hearing under s. 741.30, medical records, affidavits, or any other relevant information; or
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The party has a criminal record.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court must consider the party's financial resources prior to setting the bond amount under this section. Under no circumstances may the court set a bond that is unreasonable.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any deficiency of bond or security shall not absolve the violating party of responsibility to pay the full amount of damages determined by the court.
<p>(6)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a material violation of any parenting plan by removing a child from this state or this country or by concealing the whereabouts of a child, the court may order the bond or other security forfeited in whole or in part.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;This section, including the requirement to post a bond or other security, does not apply to a parent who, in a proceeding to order or modify a parenting plan or time-sharing schedule, is determined by the court to be a victim of an act of domestic violence or provides the court with reasonable cause to believe that he or she is about to become the victim of an act of domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28. An injunction for protection against domestic violence issued pursuant to s. 741.30 for a parent as the petitioner which is in effect at the time of the court proceeding shall be one means of demonstrating sufficient evidence that the parent is a victim of domestic violence or is about to become the victim of an act of domestic violence, as defined in s. 741.28, and shall exempt the parent from this section, including the requirement to post a bond or other security. A parent who is determined by the court to be exempt from the requirements of this section must meet the requirements of s. 787.03(6) if an offense of interference with the parenting plan or time-sharing schedule is committed.
<p>(7)(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon an order of forfeiture, the proceeds of any bond or other security posted pursuant to this subsection may only be used to:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimburse the nonviolating party for actual costs or damages incurred in upholding the court's parenting plan.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Locate and return the child to the residence as set forth in the parenting plan.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimburse reasonable fees and costs as determined by the court.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any remaining proceeds shall be held as further security if deemed necessary by the court, and if further security is not found to be necessary; applied to any child support arrears owed by the parent against whom the bond was required, and if no arrears exists; all remaining proceeds will be allocated by the court in the best interest of the child.
<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time after the forfeiture of the bond or other security, the party who posted the bond or other security, or the court on its own motion may request that the party provide documentation substantiating that the proceeds received as a result of the forfeiture have been used solely in accordance with this subsection. Any party using such proceeds for purposes not in accordance with this section may be found in contempt of court.

<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no previous child custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this part, and a child custody proceeding has not been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516, a child custody determination made under this section remains in effect until an order is obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516. If a child custody proceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516, a child custody determination made under this section becomes a final determination if it so provides and this state becomes the home state of the child.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a previous child custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this part, or a child custody proceeding has been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516, any order issued by a court of this state under this section must specify in the order a period that the court considers adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516. The order issued in this state remains in effect until an order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or the period expires.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;A court of this state which has been asked to make a child custody determination under this section, upon being informed that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child custody determination has been made by, a court of a state having jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516, shall immediately communicate with the other court. A court of this state which is exercising jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516, upon being informed that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child custody determination has been made by, a court of another state under a statute similar to this section shall immediately communicate with the court of that state to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child, and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order.

<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in s. 61.517, a court of this state may not exercise its jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.524 if, at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child had been commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this part, unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the court of the other state because a court of this state is a more convenient forum under s. 61.520.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in s. 61.517, a court of this state, before hearing a child custody proceeding, shall examine the court documents and other information supplied by the parties pursuant to s. 61.522.

<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;In a proceeding to modify a child custody determination, a court of this state shall determine whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has been commenced in another state.

<p><b>61.520&nbsp; Inconvenient forum.</b>--
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;A court of this state which has jurisdiction under this part to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of time the child has resided outside this state;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative financial circumstances of the parties;
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a court of this state determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;A court of this state may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this part if a child custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.

<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;A court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516 determines that this state is a more appropriate forum under s. 61.520; or
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in ss. 61.514-61.516.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a court of this state declines to exercise its jurisdiction under subsection (1), it may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child custody proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under ss. 61.514-61.516.
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction under subsection (1), it shall assess against the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses, including costs, communication expenses, attorney's fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses, and expenses for child care during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees are sought establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate. The court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against this state unless authorized by law other than this part.

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows the names and addresses of any person not a party to the proceeding who has physical custody of the child or claims rights of legal custody or physical custody of, or visitation with, the child and, if so, the names and addresses of those persons.

<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the declaration as to any of the items described in paragraphs (1)(a)-(c) is in the affirmative, the declarant shall give additional information under oath as required by the court.

<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the filing of a petition seeking enforcement of a child custody determination, the petitioner may file a verified application for the issuance of a warrant to take physical custody of the child if the child is likely to imminently suffer serious physical harm or removal from this state.
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the court, upon the testimony of the petitioner or other witness, finds that the child is likely to imminently suffer serious physical harm or removal from this state, it may issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child. The petition must be heard on the next judicial day after the warrant is executed unless that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible. The application for the warrant must include the statements required by s. 61.531(2).
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;A warrant to take physical custody of a child must:
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Recite the facts upon which a conclusion of imminent serious physical harm or removal from the jurisdiction is based;
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately; and
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide for the placement of the child pending final relief.
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent must be served with the petition, warrant, and order immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;A warrant to take physical custody of a child is enforceable throughout this state. If the court finds on the basis of the testimony of the petitioner or other witness that a less intrusive remedy is not effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The court may impose conditions upon placement of a child to ensure the appearance of the child and the child's custodian.
