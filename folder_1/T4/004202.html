Pilots soon foundthe necessity of seat belts to avoid being tossed out of the seats oftheir machines when flying through turbulence. One of the first womenpilots, Harriet Quimby, and her passenger, flying without seat beltsin a Bleriot airplane over Boston, Massachusetts, in 1911, wereunfortunately thrown out of their machine and fell 1500 feet to theirdeaths. In more recent years, gusts have been recognized as one ofthe sources of critical design loads on airplanes, as well as asource of fatigue loads due to repeated small loads. In addition tothese design problems, many people are susceptible to airsicknesswhen flying through rough air.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite the long interest of airplanedesigners in the effects of turbulence, very few efforts have beenmade to design airplanes with reduced response to gusts. Even in1995, none of the commonly used transport airplanes or generalaviation aircraft were equipped with gust-alleviationsystems.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the past, several attempts have beenmade by airplane designers to build airplanes with reduced responseto turbulence. All of these attempts were characterized by anintuitive approach with no attempt at analysis prior to flight tests,and all were notably unsuccessful.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of these airplanes (figure 13.1) wasdesigned by Waldo Waterman. It had wings attached to the fuselagewith skewed hinges and restrained by pneumatic struts that acted assprings. The effect of the skewed hinge was to reduce the angle ofattack of the wing panels when they deflected upward, and vice versa.The response to gusts was not noticeably reduced from that of theairplane with the wings locked, probably because the dynamic responseof the system was not suitable. Also, the degree of flexibility ofthe wings was limited because deflection of the ailerons woulddeflect the wings to oppose the aileron rolling moment, whichresulted in reduced or reversed roll response.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">The effect of wings with skewed,spring-loaded hinges is similar to the effect of bending of a sweptwing. Airplanes with swept wings do have smoother rides in certainfrequency ranges and suffer from reduced aileron reversal speed whencompared with airplanes with unswept wings.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">A similar method that has been triedinflight is to incorporate springs in the struts of a conventionalstrut-braced high-wing monoplane.

This method has alsoproved ineffective, probably because of the slow dynamic response ofthe system.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Other schemes involving wing motion havebeen proposed from time to time, and some of them have beeninvestigated in wind-tunnel tests or in flight. One method that hasbeen given considerable attention is the 'free wing" concept. In thismethod, the wing is pivoted with respect to the fuselage about aspanwise hinge ahead of its aerodynamic center, and its angle ofattack is controlled by a flap on the trailing edge. A seriousdisadvantage of this method is that upflap deflection must be used totrim the wing at a high-lift coefficient for landing. This flapobviously reduces the maximum lift, just the opposite from what isnormally obtained with a downward-deflected landing flap. Also, thedynamic response of the wing may be too slow to provide reduction ofthe accelerations due to high-frequency gusts.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">In England, shortly after WW 11, a largecommercial airplane called the Brabazon was designed. In the designstage, a system was incorporated to reduce wing bending due to gustsby operating the ailerons symmetrically to oppose bending due togusts. The ailerons were to be operated by a mechanical linkageconnected to the wing in a way to be moved by wing bending. Thesystem was abandoned before the airplane was flown, and the airplanenever went into production. Nevertheless, the projectstimu</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">-[</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">115</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] -</FONT><I><FONTFACE="Geneva">lated interest in a flight project at the RoyalAircraft Establishment (RAE) in which a system of this type was triedin a Lancaster bomber. This system used a vane ahead of the nose as agust detector to operate the ailerons symmetrically through ahydraulic servomechanism. The system was built with littlepreliminary analysis, and when the pilot engaged the system inflightfor the first time, the flight in rough air seemed noticeably morebumpy than without the system. By reversing the sign of the gainconstant relating aileron deflection to vane deflection, the ride wasmade somewhat smoother. Later, an analysis by an RAE engineer namedJ. Zbrozek showed the reasons for the unexpected behavior. Thesereasons will be mentioned later in the presentation.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another experimental program was conductedon a C-47 airplane by the Air Force. This system was similar to thatoriginally planned for the Brabazon. The ailerons were arranged todeflect symmetrically upward with upward wing bending, and viceversa, by means of a linkage which added a component of thisdeflection to that of the conventional aileron linkage. Since thewing deflection provided a large driving force, no servomechanism wasrequired, and as a result, a system of high reliability was expected.The system suffered from the same objections as the one tested on theLancaster. In addition, the inertia of the ailerons combined withflexibility of the operating linkage caused the aileron deflection tolag behind the wing deflection. Such a system is very conducive toflutter To avoid flutter, the ratio between the aileron deflectionand wing bending had to be kept to a very low value. As a result, thesystem was unable to provide more than 9 percent reduction in wingbending moments, a rather small improvement.</FONT></I></P><P><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite the discouraging results of theseexperiments, the advantages of gust alleviation remained worthwhile.As a result, a project was initiated at Langley to study thissubject. These activities are described in the followingsection.</FONT></I></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Background and Analysis of GustAlleviation</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I became head of the Stability and ControlSection of the Flight Research Division in 1943. During the wartimeyears, there was little difficulty in deciding on the type of work tobe done by the section. Most of the work was concerned with flyingqualities or with improving the control systems of airplanes. Some ofthis work has been described in the preceding sections or may befurther seen from my list of reports (appendix II). By 1947, jetairplanes with power control systems were being developed, and theuse of automatic control to improve the stability characteristics ofairplanes was a rapidly developing field. Applications of automaticcontrol were therefore important subjects of research. The change inemphasis was recognized in 1952 when I was made head of the Guidanceand Control Branch of the Flight Research Division.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the military services, the new technologyof automatic control was largely applied in the development of guidedmissiles. At Langley, the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division, underGilruth, had been established to use missiles for aerodynamicresearch. Some of the engineers in that division, however, becameinterested in guided missiles. Gilruth and William N. Gardinerstarted to perform tests on a missile with infrared guidance thatused gyroscopic stabilization and employed rocket propulsiontechniques developed for aerodynamic testing. It later turned outthat this missile was very similar in concept to the Sidewindermissile developed by the Navy, which was one of the first air-to-airguided missiles widely employed by the armed services.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Deputy Director of the NACA at that timewas Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, a noted scientist, who was also a laypreacher in the Methodist Church and a religious man. He did not liketo see the NACA centers unnecessarily involved in military work. Heissued [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">116</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] a directive that no work with military applicationsshould be done at the NACA centers unless requested by the militaryservices.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">From the standpoint of a stability and controlengineer, the study of missile guidance systems was one of the mostinteresting and challenging fields available at that time.Nevertheless, I had the same feelings as Dr. Dryden concerning thedesire to avoid emphasis on military projects. With this area ofresearch ruled out, I was faced with the question of what type ofautomatic control research with peacetime applications was of mostinterest. At that time, airplanes with swept wings were starting tobe fitted with yaw dampers to improve the damping of lateraloscillations, particularly at high altitudes. Yaw dampers, however,did not require much research. In most cases, companies were able tohook up a rate gyroscope through an analog amplifier to the powercontrol actuator on the rudder, and the system worked very well indamping out lateral oscillations.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After much thought, I concluded that one fieldin which automatic control could be applied and which had notpreviously been studied to any great extent, was gust alleviation. Agust-alleviation system is one that provides the airplane with asmooth ride through rough air. At that time, all transport airplaneshad piston engines and flew at altitudes below the top of stormclouds. Fear of airsickness was a common problem and was a deterrentto many people who wanted to travel on commercial airlines.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I was already familiar with one study of gustalleviation that had been made. Philip Donely, who was then a branchhead in the Loads Division, had formerly been designer of the gusttunnel at Langley. In this wind tunnel, a model was catapulted atflying speed through a vertical jet of air to simulate a gust in theatmosphere. Evidently while doing this work, Donely had come across areport by Rene Hirsch in France on a study of gust alleviation doneas a doctoral thesis and published in 1938 (ref. 13.1). Donelybrought this report to my attention. Hirsch had devised agust-alleviation system in which the halves of the horizontal tailwere attached by chordwise hinges. These surfaces were connected bypushrods to flaps on the wing. On encountering an upward gust, thetail halves would deflect up, moving the flaps up and therebyoffsetting the effect of the gust. Other features of the system madethe airplane insensitive to horizontal gusts and to rolling gusts,all without adversely affecting the ability of the pilot to controlthe airplane. These many ingenious features are too complex todiscuss herein.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I was very impressed by the report for tworeasons. First, Hirsch had performed an analysis to determine therelations between the tail, elevator, and flap hinge-momentcharacteristics; linkage ratios; and other parameters so that theflaps moved exactly the right amount to offset the effect of a gust.This analysis required consideration of so-called stabilityderivatives for all these components. At that time, stabilityderivatives were used to describe the stability characteristics of anairplane, such as, the variation of pitching moment with angle ofattack <IMG SRC="eq1p116.jpg" ALT="mathematical symbol" WIDTH=47HEIGHT=33 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom>andthe variation of lift coefficient with angle of attack <IMGSRC="eq2p116.jpg" ALT="mathematical symbol" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=34X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom>. Prior to1938, very few people had ever considered similar quantities forcontrol surfaces or flaps, such as variation of flap hinge momentwith angle of attack or variation of elevator hinge moment withdeflection. Hirsch's analysis required a multitude of thesequantities, as well as linkage ratios and other quantities describingthe mechanism, all tied together by algebraic equations that weresolved to obtain the desired design characteristics of thesystem.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The second important contribution by Hirschwas that he tested his system with a dynamic model. I have previouslymentioned some of my experiments with a dynamic model. In Hirsch'scase, the model was mounted in a wind tunnel so that it was free topitch and to slide up and down on a vertical rod. The tunnel had anopen throat and was equipped with a series of slats ahead of the testsection, similar to a venetian blind, that could be deflected toproduce an abrupt change in the [</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">117</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] flow direction.When Hirsch tested his model in this artificial gust with the systemlocked, it immediately banged up against its stop at the top of therod. With the system working, however, it showed only a smalldisturbance and settled back to stable flight.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Hirsch was so impressed by these results thathe devoted most of his professional life to demonstrating the systemin flight. I later corresponded with Hirsch, visited him in France,and saw his airplanes. This part of the story will be mentionedlater. At the time I read the thesis, however, I simply realized thatgust alleviation was a feasible idea and that with automaticcontrols, it might be possible to do the job more simply than Hirschhad done with his complex aeromechanical system.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I started, in 1948, to make analyses of theresponse of example airplanes to sinusoidal gusts and the controlmotions that would be required to reduce (alleviate) the response ofthe airplane or the accelerations that would be applied to thepassengers. The method used was what has been described earlier asthe frequency-response method, which had the advantage that thecalculations were greatly simplified when compared with calculatingresponse to discrete gust inputs. These early studies showed, as wasknown from experience, that control by the elevators alone wasineffective. Control by flaps on the wing was thought to bepromising, but the analysis showed that in many cases, the flapswould produce excessive pitching response of the airplane. Ingeneral, control by a combination of flap and elevators was required.With flaps alone, successful results could be obtained only bycareful attention to the pitching moments applied to the airplane bythe gust and by the flaps.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A survey was also made of previous attempts atgust alleviation on full-scale airplanes. These included an airplanemade by Waterman with wings pivoted on skewed hinges, a DC-3 modifiedby the Air Force so that the ailerons deflected symmetrically inresponse to wing bending, and an Avro Lancaster bomber modified bythe British in which the ailerons were moved symmetrically inresponse to gusts sensed by a vane on the nose. All these attempts,made without any theoretical analysis, had been unsuccessful in thatvery little alleviation of airplane accelerations was obtained. Myanalysis showed why each of the attempts had failed. In general, thelack of attention to pitching moments produced by the controlsurfaces was responsible. In the case of the Lancaster, for example,the symmetric deflection of the ailerons in the upward directionproportional to a positive change in angle of attack produced apositive, or upward, pitching moment. A positive variation ofpitching moment with angle of attack represents a decrease inlongitudinal stability. This decrease in stability increased theresponse to low-frequency gusts, which resulted in an increase in thebumpy ride experienced by the pilots. In addition, the aileron motionreduced the damping of the wing bending oscillation, which increasedthe effect of structural oscillations on the sensation of the pilots.In considering the effect of the ailerons on the pitching moments, itshould be realized that a symmetric upward deflection of the aileronsproduces a direct effect on the pitching moments of the wing. It alsochanges the wing lift distribution to produce an increased downwashon the tail due to up aileron deflection, which further increases thedestabilizing variation of pitching moment with angle of attack. Myanalysis showed that the downwash effects on the tail due to thedeflection of flaps or ailerons on the wing are very important indesigning a gust-alleviation system.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After making these preliminary studies, Ianalyzed a system in which a gust-sensing vane mounted on a boomahead of the nose was used to operate flaps on the wing through ahydraulic servomechanism. Any gust-alleviation system working on thisprinciple reduces the lift produced by a change in angle of attack.For complete alleviation, the lift due to angle of attack is reducedto zero. Since the pilot maneuvers the airplane by changing its angleof attack, this system would prevent the pilot from making any[</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">118</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]longitudinal maneuvers. To restore this capability, the input fromthe control stick, normally used to move the elevators, was also fedto the flap servomechanism. With this arrangement, when the pilotmoves the stick back to make a pull up, the flaps first go down toproduce upward lift. Then, as the angle of attack increases inresponse to the elevator motion, the flaps move back to neutral andthe pull up is continued with the airplane at a higher angle ofattack. The result is a faster response to control motion thanobtained with a conventional airplane. This type of control, in lateryears, has been called "direct lift control" and is advantageous forcontrol situations requiring rapid response.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The analysis also showed that provision had tobe made for avoiding excessive pitching moments due to the gusts andflap deflection. Since the flaps were moved in proportion to angle ofattack, any pitching moment from the flaps contributed directly tothe variation of pitching moment with angle of attack, whichdetermines the longitudinal stability of the airplane. Forsatisfactory stability, the pitching moment due to angle of attackmust be kept within prescribed limits. The additional contributiondue to the gust-alleviation</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">system had the possibility of greatlyexceeding these limits, which made the airplane either violentlyunstable or excessively stable. It was possible to solve theequations to determine the flap and elevator motion to completelyoffset both the lift and pitching moments applied to the airplane.This analysis showed that this objective could be attained in twoways. In one method, both the flap and elevator had to be moved inresponse to the gust, but the elevator motion was not in phase withthe flap motion and generally had to lag behind the flap motion. Inthe other method, the elevator and flap moved in phase, but thedownwash from the flaps on the tail had to be of opposite sign fromthat normally encountered. That is, down flap deflection had toproduce an upwash at the horizontal tail.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Having reached this stage in the analysis, theresults appeared sufficiently promising for a report on the resultsand a flight program to demonstrate a gust-alleviation system. A joborder request was submitted about June 1948 to obtain officialapproval for this work. This job order is presented here toillustrate the type of request required to get a research programapproved.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><DL>   <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">Title: Theoretical and Experimental Study   of Means to Increase the Smoothness of Flight through Rough   Air.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">Est.

Little effort wasrequired for this phase of the job approval.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When the work described in this job order wasundertaken, I appointed Christopher C. (Chris) Kraft, Jr. as projectengineer. Kraft was then an engineer in my section with experience inflying qualities and with work using the free-fall and wing-flowmethods. Later in his career, he was a flight controller during theApollo missions and was made director of the Johnson Space FlightCenter following Dr. Gilruth's retirement. Kraft and I madeadditional calculations to have a logical series of examples to placein the report, which was later entitled Theoretical Study of SomeMethods for Increasing the Smoothness of Flight through Rough Air(ref. 13.2). The report starts with a review of the available data onthe causes of airsickness. The main source of data, which is stillbelieved to be the best available, was a series of tests made duringWW II at Wesleyan University, in which subjects were tested withvarious wave forms of vertical acceleration in an elevator. Theresults showed that relatively low-frequency variations ofacceleration that had periods of 1.4 seconds and greater were themost important causes of motion sickness.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Excellent control of the directional androlling disturbances of airplanes could be obtained with conventionalautopilots available at the time the report was written. Thesedevices, however, were relatively ineffective in reducing thevertical accelerations of airplanes. The report thereforeconcentrated on the problems of longitudinal gust alleviation andcontrol.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Following a section on the theoreticalanalysis, examples were included in the report to show the use ofelevator alone, flaps alone, and a combination of flap and elevatormotion to offset the effect of gusts. Next, two types of gust-sensingdevices, a vane ahead of the nose and an accelerometer in theairplane, were considered. Because these systems affect thecontrollability of the airplane. detailed studies were made of staticand dynamic longitudinal stability of airplanes incorporating thesesystems.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In various studies of gust-alleviation systemsmade by other researchers since the one described herein, the nowpopular approach of optimal control theory has been applied. In thismethod, some balance is sought between the amount of control motionrequired by the system and the amount of reduction of accelerationachieved. In the study made by Phillips and Kraft, however, an effortwas made to achieve complete gust alleviation within the limitsimposed by the assumptions of the theory. Complete alleviation wasfound to be possible with the vanetype sensor, but not with theaccelerometer sensor. Inasmuch as complete alleviation was found tobe possible with reasonable control motions, the use of optimalcontrol theory when a vane sensor is used is really not optimal andrepresents an inappropriate application of this theory.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The theory used for the analysis is verysimilar to that taught by Professor Koppen in my courses at MIT. Thistheory, in turn, was based on the theory first presented by G. H.Bryan in England in 1903 and later in the textbook Stability inAviation in 1911 (ref. 4. 1). This theory shows that the longitudinaland lateral motions of the airplane can be considered separately andassumes small disturbances so that all aerodynamic forces and momentscan be assumed to vary linearly with the magnitude of thedisturbance. This theory was extended to calculate the response of anairplane to gusts and reported in NACA Report No. 1 and later reportsin the period 1915-1918 by Edwin B. Wilson, then a professor ofPhysics at MIT. To study the effect of a gust-alleviation system, itwas necessary only to add to Wilson's theory the additional forcesand moments caused by the airplane's control surfaces as they weremoved by the gust-alleviation system. Like Wilson, I considered thatthe gust was constant across the span, though this subject wasstudied in more detail later.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">120</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Two refinementswere added to the theory, as presented by Wilson, that were found tobe of importance for the study of gust-alleviation systems and thatare believed to make the results very close to what would be obtainedwith an exact computer simulation such as would be possible withmodern electronic computers. First, the penetration effect wasconsidered, that is, the difference in the time of penetrating thegust by a vane ahead of the nose, the wing, and the tail. In Wilson'sstudy, the gust was assumed to affect all parts of the airplanesimultaneously. Second, the time lead or lag effects caused by gustpenetration were approximated by a linearized representation to keepthe equations linear. This technique had been used by Cowley andGlauert in a British report published in 1921 to improve thecalculation of pitch damping of airplanes by taking into account thetime for the downwash leaving the wing to reach the tail (ref. 13.3).A similar method was used in the present analysis to account for allthe lead and lag effects, such as the lead of the vane in penetratingthe gust, the lag in response of the servomechanism operating theflaps, and the lag of downwash from the wing and flaps in hitting thetail, in addition to the lag of the gust itself in reaching the tail.These lead and lag effects were found to be very important,particularly in affecting the damping of the short-periodlongitudinal motion of the alleviated airplane.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A useful advantage was found in this approachin that all the effects of the alleviation systems studied could beconsidered as changes to stability derivatives of the basic airplane.Most of the effects of these derivatives were known from experience,or at least had simple physical interpretations. In addition, theorder of the equations was not increased over that of the basicairplane.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">These equations made it possible to solve forthe characteristics of the system that would produce complete gustalleviation, that is, that would produce zero response to a gust. Inexamining these formulas, I suddenly realized that the results had asimple physical interpretation. This interpretation is shown infigure 13.2, in which an airplane with a vanetype gust-alleviationsystem is shown penetrating a region in the atmosphere where there isa change in vertical gust velocity (called a step gust). First, thevane is deflected by the gust. If the servomechanism operating theflaps has a time lag equal to the time for the gust to reach thewing, then the flap moves just at the right time and the right amountto offset the lift change on the wing due to the gust. For theairplane response to be zero, however, the pitching moment about thecenter of gravity caused by the flap deflection must be zero. Thiscondition is not ordinarily obtained with conventional wing flaps,but may be obtained by moving the elevators the correct amount inphase with the flaps. A little later, the tail is affected by thegust and by the downwash from the flaps. The effect of the forces onthe tail can be eliminated in two ways. Either the flap downwash mustbe equal and opposite to the effect of the gust on the tail or theelevator must be given an additional movement to cancel the combinedeffect of the flap downwash and the gust.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The simple interpretation of the action of aperfect gust alleviation system has interesting ramifications. First,the influence of the feedback of angle of attack from the vane makesthe alleviation system a closed-loop control system, but the feedbackdecreases as the system approaches the condition of complete gustalleviation. In this condition, the system behaves as an open-loopcontrol, because there is no motion of the airplane to be sensed bythe vane. Second, the consideration of lag effects is seen to beexact in the limiting case of perfect alleviation, even though theseresults were obtained from an approximate linearized theory. Third,the discovery of this interpretation could presumably have been madea priori, without use of any theory, but in my case, working throughthe theory first and examining the resulting formulas was necessaryfor me to realize that this interpretation existed. Many simplephysical principles in the history of physics...</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>[<A NAME="121"></A></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">121</FONT></B><FONTFACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p121.htm"><IMGSRC="figure13.2s.jpg" ALT="FIGURE 13.2."

A boom was built onthe nose to hold the angle-of-attack vane as shown in figure 13.4.The wing flaps, which normally deflect only downward, were modifiedto move up and down because both up and down gusts must becounteracted by the system. The elevator was split into threesections, the two outboard segments being linked to the flaps for usewith the gust-alleviation system and the inboard segment being usedin the normal manner for pitch control (figure 13.5). Finally, smallsegments of the flaps near the fuselage were driven separately fromthe rest of the flap system so that they could be geared to moveeither in the same direction or in the opposite direction from therest of the flaps (figure 13.6).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As stated previously, perfect gust alleviationaccording to the theory could have been obtained either by drivingthe elevator separately from the flaps and with a different phaserelationship or the elevator could have been geared directly to theflaps and the downwash from the flaps altered to offset the gust atthe tail. The latter method was selected for the following reasons.With a direct mechanical linkage between the flaps and the outboardelevators, the pitching moment due to flap deflection, a criticalquantity for longitudinal stability, could be finely adjusted asrequired and would hold its setting. If a separate servomechanism andelectronic amplifier had been used to operate the elevators, the gainof the amplifier might have drifted and caused the airplane to becomeunstable.

This method of course, reduces the flap effectiveness inproducing lift. To regain sufficient flap effectiveness, the flapsand ailerons were geared together so that the flaps and aileronsdeflected symmetrically for gust alleviation. These surfaces weredriven by an electrical input variable-displacement pump hydraulicservomechanism, which was taken from a naval gun turret. Electricalsignals from the vane and the pilot's control column were combined ina vacuum-tube amplifier and fed to the control valve of theservomechanism. For lateral control, the entire flap and aileronsystem was deflected asymmetrically through a separate servomechanismof the same type. The system was designed so that the airplane couldbe flown through its original manual control system if[</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">125</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]the alleviation system failed or was switched off. In thisconfiguration, the control wheel on the pilot's side remainedconnected at all times to the inboard segment of the elevator and tothe ailerons. In the gust-alleviation mode, the ailerons were drivensymmetrically through preloaded spring struts. This system remainedconnected in the manual mode, but the pilot could overpower theforces in the preloaded struts with his inputs to the control wheel.With the system in the gust-alleviation mode, the control wheel onthe copilot's side was used to apply control inputs through theelectronic control system. In addition, it remained connected throughthe mechanical linkage to the inboard portion of the elevator.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When the pilot turned the alleviation systemoff, the actuator driving the flaps was bypassed, and a separatehydraulic actuator with its own accumulator forcibly drove the flapsto neutral with a caliper-like linkage that could capture the flapsin any position.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Changes in angle of attack due to change inairspeed or drift of the amplifier used to operate the flaps couldhave caused the trim position of the flaps to vary slowly in flight.To maintain the trim position of the flaps at zero deflection overlong periods, a mechanical ball-disk integrator driven by the flaplinkage was used to feed an additional signal into the flapservomechanism to slowly run the flaps to the neutral position. Thissystem had a time constant of 10 seconds, which was slow enough toavoid interference with the gust-alleviation function or the controlof the airplane. To provide automatic control of the lateral anddirectional motion of the airplane in the gust-alleviation mode, aSperry A-12 autopilot was connected to the aileron and ruddersystems. This autopilot was the most advanced type available at thetime of the tests.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Finally, the pilots landed the airplane withthe wing flaps in neutral. This operation did not pose any problem onthe long runways at Langley Field, but the design of a high-lift flapsystem that can also provide upward deflection of the flap for gustalleviation remains one of the engineering problems of such systemsthat no one has yet tried to solve.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The airplane was instrumented with straingauges to measure wing shear and bending moments at two stations andtail shear and bending moment at the root. The project became a jointproject with the Aircraft Loads Branch. After the tests werecompleted, two reports had been published by each group: an initialand a final report on the gust-alleviation characteristics and aninitial and a final report on the loads (refs. 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, and13.7).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The tests occupied a long period of time. Oneof the main problems encountered was finding suitable rough air. TheNACA test pilots were understandably conservative in flyingexperimental airplanes and usually declined to do test flying inclouds or stormy weather. Clear-air turbulence occurred on occasionsafter passage of a cold front. These conditions were used as often aspossible in making the tests, but frequently the turbulence was oflow intensity. For these reasons, some of the data were not asextensive as might have been desired.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite these problems, results were obtainedwith various sets of gearings to obtain varying degrees oflongitudinal stability, and cases with the inboard flaps in neutraland moving oppositely from the outboard flaps were studied.

This plot is of interest to the control engineerand shows correctly the relative magnitude of the normal accelerationfor the two cases at various frequencies, but does not include thevariation of the actual gust forcing function with frequency. In part(b), the square root of the power spectral density of the response isplotted as a function of frequency on linear [</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">128</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] scales. This plotattempts to show the actual magnitude of the normal acceleration ateach frequency. This plot is believed to be more meaningful ininterpreting the passengers' impression of a ride in theairplane.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As can be seen, the basic airplane has a largepeak in the acceleration response at a frequency about 0.2 hertz.This low-frequency peak is typical of the response of unalleviatedairplanes and occurs because of the larger amplitude of theturbulence input at low frequencies. In the case of the alleviatedairplane, the response is reduced to a fairly constant, relativelylow value in the frequency range between 0 and 1.6 hertz. For thedegree of turbulence encountered, this reduction greatly improved thesubjective impression of ride comfort. Though the results are notshown on the plots, the response at frequencies above 2 hertz withthe alleviation system operating were slightly increased above thoseof the basic airplane. Also, in turbulence of relatively largemagnitude, the pilots noted a fore-and aft oscillation caused by dragof the flaps at large deflections.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though the results obtained were quitegratifying, the question arises as to why the performance of thesystem was not better, inasmuch as the theory predicted perfect gustalleviation. One of the main reasons was the nonlinearcharacteristics of the servomechanism used to drive the flap system.The designer of the system in the Instrument Research Division hadbeen requested to provide a rather sharp cutoff in the responsebeyond 2 hertz, to avoid the possibility of exciting wing flutter.The C-45 was a very stiff airplane, with the wing primary bendingmode at 8 hertz. It was intended, therefore, that the output of theservomechanism should be close to zero at a frequency of 8 hertz. Itwas not until after the device was installed that it was found thatthe cutoff in response had been obtained by rate limiting the output.This provided a steep cutoff, but the response was a function ofamplitude. The result was that in a large amplitude gust, ratelimiting was encountered and the alleviation was reduced just when itwas needed most. A later unpublished investigation of the effects ofrate limiting demonstrated these adverse effects and showed that withsufficiently severe rate limiting, a continuous sawtooth oscillationof the flap would be encountered in rough air, which resulted inresponse greater than that of the basic airplane.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A second problem was the nonlinear liftcharacteristics of the flaps. The flaps deflected about plus or minus25 degrees, but the slope of the curve of lift versus flap deflectionfell off markedly before this deflection was reached. As a result, afixed gain between the vane and the flaps did not give a uniformvalue of the ratio of lift to gust angle of attack. This nonlinearresponse would be expected to introduce higher frequency harmonicsinto the response and probably accounts for the increase in responsebeyond 2 hertz. This and other characteristics were not known beforethe tests were made. I concluded that on any future project of thistype, wind-tunnel tests of the airplane to determine the controlcharacteristics would be advisable. Despite these deficiencies,enough was learned to show the feasibility of gust alleviation and toshow how the results could be improved in a future attempt.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Analytical Studies of AdditionalProblems</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The studies of gust alleviation introducedseveral problems that had not been considered previously in airplanedesign. One problem was the effect of variations in gust velocityacross the wing span. The use of a single vane on the center line ofthe airplane to sense the gusts would work perfectly if the gustvelocity were constant across the wing span, but would be lesseffective if different values of gust velocity were encountered atdifferent stations along the span. This problem can be studied if theturbulence in the atmosphere is assumed to be isotropic (or for[</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">129</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]this application, axisymmetric); that is, it has the samecharacteristics regardless of the direction in which the airplane isflying. This assumption appears reasonable for most types ofturbulence. The theory of isotropic turbulence had been studiedtheoretically. The nature of the spectrum of turbulence, that is, theway the gust velocity varies with gust wavelength, had beendetermined. The gust velocity has been found experimentally to varyapproximately directly with the wavelength even for wavelengths manytimes larger than the wing span of the largest existing airplanes.The most intense gusts, which cause the most disturbance to theairplane, have wavelengths long compared to the wing span and aretherefore approximately constant across the span. Gusts withwavelengths short compared to the span have low intensity andtherefore do not disturb the airplane much. The use of a single vaneon the center line is therefore quite effective. Gusts of wavelengthshort compared to the span may cause up and down loads that averageout across the span. For these gusts, the response of the vane at thecenter line would be too large. These gusts have such high frequency,however, that the vane response is filtered by the lag in response ofthe flap servomechanism. For a vane located ahead of the nose, thelag in the flap servomechanism is also beneficial in delaying theresponse sensed by the vane until the gust reaches the wing.Considering these factors, the effectiveness of a gust-alleviationsystem using a vane on the centerline may be shown to be about 98percent as effective in axisymmetric turbulence as it would be withgusts constant across the span. This problem was studied in moredetail after the flight investigation was completed (refs. 13.8 and13.9).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">An interesting optimization problem, which tomy knowledge has not been solved, is to determine the optimal filterto place between the vane and the flap to obtain the greatest amountof gust alleviation, considering the distance of the vane ahead ofthe wing, the wing span, and the spectrum of atmospheric turbulence.This problem is only of academic importance, however, as about 98percent alleviation was obtained by using a second-order linearfilter with reasonable frequency and 0.7 critical damping (refs. 13.6and 13.7).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Some time after completion of the tests, asummary report was given as part of a lecture series at RenssellaerPolytechnic Institute (ref. 13.10). This paper gives a more completediscussion of the subject of gust alleviation than containedherein.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Future Possibilities of GustAlleviation</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Some review of later efforts in the field ofgust alleviation may be of interest, inasmuch as the development ofcomputers and automatic control technology would permit approachesquite different from that used in the early NACA tests. It was adisappointment to me that very little effort was made by aircraftcompanies to incorporate provision for gust alleviation even afterthe development of control technology would have made it morefeasible.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">To my knowledge, the only airplane in servicethat incorporates a system performing some gust-alleviation functionis the Lockheed 1011. In some later models, the wing span wasincreased by extending the wing tips to allow the airplane to carrygreater loads. To avoid changing the wing structure to withstandgreater bending moments, the ailerons were operated symmetrically byan automatic control system to reduce bending moments due togusts.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One reason for the lack of interest in gustalleviation is that following the NACA tests, jet transports wereintroduced. As a result of higher wing loading, swept wings, flightat higher altitudes, and the use of weather radar to avoid storms,these airplanes were much less likely to encounter violent airplanemotions that would cause airsickness. In addition, the problem ofgust alleviation became more difficult because the structuralflexibility of these airplanes placed their [</FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva">130</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] structuralfrequencies closer to the frequency range of interest forgust-alleviation. As a result, structural response would have to beconsidered in designing the system. In recent years, these reasonsfor avoiding the use of gust-alleviation systems have become lesssignificant. Extensive use is now made of commuter airplanes that flyat lower altitudes and frequently encounter rough air. In addition,methods have been developed to analyze the structural response and todamp out the structural modes by use of automatic controlsystems.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Review of Work by Ren&eacute;Hirsch</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In closing, a brief review is given of thework of Rene Hirsch, whose thesis was mentioned at the beginning ofthis chapter. Also, a few programs and studies applicable to gustalleviation that have occurred since the NACA program on the C-45 arereviewed.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After reviewing Hirsch's thesis, no more washeard of his activity until the early 1950's, during the course ofthe NACA program. At this time, a French report was discoveredrevealing that, following WW II, Hirsch had made additionalwind-tunnel tests in the French large-scale tunnel at Chalais-Meudonon a model of a proposed airplane and had built this smalltwin-engine airplane incorporating his system. The airplane wasenvisioned as a quarter-scale model of a piston-engine transport of aclass similar to the Douglas DC-6 or the Lockheed Constellation,which were the largest transports in service in that period.Correspondence was established with Hirsch and additional reports andinformation were obtained (ref. 13.11). Hirsch's airplane had a wingspan of 27 feet and had two 100-horsepower motors. It incorporatedthe same system described in his thesis, in which the halves of thehorizontal tail moved on chordwise hinges to operate flaps on thewings. The conventional elevators provided not only pitching moments,but moved the tail halves about their chordwise hinges to cause theflaps to move in the direction to provide direct lift control. Inthis way, the loss of longitudinal control due to thegust-alleviation system was overcome. Hirsch's airplane incorporatedmany other ingenious features, including provisions for reducingrolling moments due to rolling gusts and lift due to horizontalgusts. His design also incorporated large pneumatic servos operatedby dynamic pressure to restore damping in roll and to stabilize therate of climb or descent. The airplane had good handling qualitiesand appeared to have been very successful in providing a smooth ride,as shown by some time histories in rough air with the system turnedon and off. After about 30 flights, the airplane ran into a ditch atthe end of the runway and was damaged.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">No more was heard until 1967, when anotherreport appeared showing that the airplane had been rebuilt andequipped with two 180-horsepower motors (ref. 13.12). In thiscondition, the airplane made numerous additional flights withsomewhat more complete instrumentation. A photograph of the airplanein flight is shown in figure 13.10. From the data obtained, theresults appeared very similar to those obtained with the NACA C-45 inthat the accelerations due to gusts were reduced by about 60 percentat frequencies below about 2 hertz, but were increased somewhat athigher frequencies.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">All of Hirsch's work in designing and buildinghis airplanes was done with his own funds, though some help withinstrumentation was obtained from ONERA, the French equivalent of theNACA. Outside of France, Hirsch's work was little known. His reportsdescribed the work in general, but were not sufficiently detailed togive engineering data on all of the ingenious ideas and systemsincorporated on his airplanes.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1975 during a trip to France, I visitedHirsch.

Thisairplane was never as successful, in Hirsch's opinion, as the firstone, probably because of its lower airspeed and lower frequency ofresponse of the flap systems. In recent years (1995), Hirsch modifieda third airplane, the Sobata Trinidad, with small canard surfacesahead of the wing root to operate the flaps. The more forwardposition of these sensing surfaces was intended to improve theresponse to high-frequency gusts. Hirsch died in August 1995 at theage of 87 without having had the opportunity to test his latestdesign.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Hirsch's dedication to the pursuit of gustalleviation is a remarkable story in view of the general disregard ofthis subject by the rest of the aviation industry. Of course, theaeromechanical systems used by Hirsch have been superseded byautomatic controls using computers and electro-hydraulic actuators.Hirsch readily admitted that he would prefer such systems but wasunable to afford them.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P><P><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Later Studies by OtherInvestigators</FONT></B></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Though a number of studies of gust alleviationhave been made during the years since the C-45 tests, most of themhave not contributed any notable new developments. Only two arementioned to bring the subject up to date. One is the so-called LAMSproject, an acronym for Load Alleviation and Mode Stabilization,conducted at the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory atWright-Patterson</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Air Force Base, Ohio, about 1968-1969 (ref.13.13). In this project, a B-52 bomber was equipped with anelectronic analog-type flight control system to operate the existingflight controls to damp out structural modes. This work is importantbecause consideration of damping of structural modes would berequired in any attempt to install a gust-alleviation system in ahigh-speed airplane. The report illustrates the success of moderncontrol analysis techniques (as they existed at that time) indesigning a modal damping system and in predicting the resultsobtained.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The second contribution of note is theanalytical work of Dr. Edmund G. Rynaski, formerly of Calspan and nowat EGR Associates, in designing a system to alleviate both therigid-body motions and selected structural modes of an airplane (ref.13.14). Rynaski's work, based on matrix analysis techniques, showshow to provide essentially open-loop control of the rigid-body modes,as was done on the C-45 airplane, as well as to provide open-loopcancellation of a selected number of structural modes. This methodalso makes possible improved damping of higher order structural modesby use of closed-loop control.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">With the availability of digital flightcomputers and modern control actuators, different approaches shouldbe considered for gust alleviation. One approach would be to operatethe flaps on the wing as a function of angle of attack sensed by avane or similar device, but to operate the elevators by a modernreliable pitch damper as part of a longitudinal command controlsystem to control the pitching response of the airplane. Anotherapproach would be to calculate absolute gust velocity on line by amethod similar to that referred to previously in the work by Craneand Chilton in measuring gust velocity (ref. 12.5). This methodrequires correcting the angle of attack measured by a vane for theinertial motions of the airplane at the vane location. This signalcould be used as an input into a gust-alleviation system without theneed to modify the normal control or handling qualities of theairplane.</FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="ch12.htm"><IMG SRC="previous.gif"ALT="previous" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="contents.htm"><IMG SRC="index.gif" ALT="index"WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="ch14.htm"><IMGSRC="next.gif" ALT="next" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
