<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The origin and early diversification of
multicellular organisms do not seem to mark planets in a fashion
detectable from afar. Indeed, after generations of effort, the
uncertainty associated with the dating of metazoan origins and early
radiations on Earth is several hundred million years. Since we have
by no means exhausted the possible observations, there is still hope
that we shall further delimit the timing of these events from direct
evidence. In the meantime we must rely on indirect evidence to
support plausible models of the emergence and radiation of
multicellular organisms on Earth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of the problems has been that metazoans
with hard parts burst relatively suddenly into the fossil record,
already well-differentiated into distinctive living phyla only
distantly allied. Since evolution has been regarded as a gradual
process, it has seemed doubtful to many that these phyla arose in a
sudden burst of adaptive radiation. The Phanerozoic fossil record
suggests a long Precambrian history for multicellular forms. Durham
(1971) calculated that if Precambrian evolutionary rates were
comparable to those displayed by Phanerozoic metazoans, then the
morphological distance achieved by early Cambrian phyla implied that
divergence from a founding metazoan lineage began a billion or more
years earlier. Where are the traces or remains of those early
animals?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Within the past two decades, evidence has
accumulated to indicate that there was no such long period of gradual
metazoan evolution culminating in [</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">230</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] the ground plans of
Phanerozoic phyla. The sudden advent of fossil phyla near the early
Cambrian boundary probably coincides closely with their origin. Also
within recent years, work in genetics and developmental biology has
rendered plausible the sudden origination of such morphological
novelties. Work in Phanerozoic paleontology has shown that even when
the fossil record is most complete, most taxa display an abrupt
rather than a gradual pattern of change. This has led to a
downgrading of the role of microevolution in the origin and success
of taxa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In light of this work, an attempt is made here
to assess the factors that led to the origin of major (phylum-level)
multicellular grades and ground plans and that account for their
diversity. Two particular questions are pursued: First, if time were
turned back to the late Precambrian and multicellular grades were
allowed to evolve again, how closely would this second fauna resemble
the first, and how would it differ? Second, if this experiment were
repeated under different environmental conditions, as on another
planet, how closely would the results resemble and how differ from
those on Earth?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Figure 1 depicts the time of first appearance
in the fossil record of each living animal phylum. The figure is
fairly conservative, listing those appearances that seem at present
to be most definitive. The intent is that most subsequent changes
will involve only the discovery of earlier representatives of the
phyla. Of course, it is possible that restudy of fossil material may
discredit some of these occurrences. In most cases the earliest
records are securely based on body fossils, but for a few phyla the
remains of secreted structures (such as pogonophoran tubes) or other
traces are tentatively accepted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The earliest certain metazoan fossils occur in
the Ediacaran interval, which began 100 million years or more before
the start of the Cambrian (Glaessner, 1971). At least some elements
of the Ediacaran fauna persisted into Cambrian time (Borovikov,
1976). The characteristic Ediacaran forms are soft-bodied. The only
living phyla certainly represented are the Cnidaria and the
Echiuroidea. There are also some vermiform fossils that might
represent living phyla (perhaps the Annelida) but might equally well
be the remains of extinct ones. Finally, there are enigmatic forms
(such as </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">Tribrachidium</FONT></I><FONT

larger organisms but cannot be associated with any living phylum
(Matthews and Missarzbevsky, 1975). In the earliest Cambrian stage,
the first extensive fauna with mineralized skeletons appears and
includes skeletons identified as Mollusca. In succeeding Lower
Cambrian stages, five more living phyla appear, so that all living
phyla that have easily fossilizable hard parts appear during the
Lower Cambrian except for the Bryozoa and the Chordata.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The next first appearances are of four living
phyla in a remarkably preserved, soft-bodied fauna that also contains
hard-part remains of animals typical of the time. This is the Middle
Cambrian Burgess Shale fauna from British Columbia. It includes the
first known chordate, a soft-bodied form somewhat resembling
cephalochordates (Conway Moins and Whittington, 1979). Bryozoan
skeletons first occur in the early Ordovician.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The remaining 13 living phyla are all
soft-bodied; eight of them appear as fossils but are exceedingly
rare. The other five are not known as fossils at all. Four of these
are minute pseudocoelomates (commonly parasitic today), and one is
the diploblastic comb jellies. None of these forms leaves
characteristic traces, and they would be preserved only under the
most unusual of circumstances. Their lack of a fossil record is thus
not surprising. It is perhaps more surprising that all the living
coelomate phyla, even soft-bodied ones, do have a fossil record of
some sort.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The order of appearance of phyla in the fossil
record seems to be based more on their fossilizability than on their
order of origin. However, there is evidence that the appearance of
phyla with mineralized skeletons near the Precambrian-Cambrian
boundary is associated closely with their origins. The skeletal
ground plans of these phyla are closely coadapted with their body
plans, and in some cases the latter depend on the former (Cloud,
1948; Valentine, 1973). In these cases the advent of a mineralized
skeleton indicates the origin of the phylum, and the record indicates
that these events occurred near the Precambrian-Cambrian
boundary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The two phyla with durable skeletons that do
not appear in Lower Cambrian time, the Chordata and Bryozoa, may have
been represented then by soft-bodied lineages, for they have body
plans that do not require durable skeletons. Indeed, the chordates
appear in the Middle Cambrian, while durable chordate skeletons are
not known until the Late Cambrian (Repetski, 1978). The Bryozoa first
occur as relatively simple, calcified branching tubes, but they could
have been represented by soft-bodied forms prior to mineralization of
the tubes. Thus either of these phyla </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">could</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> have been present
in the Lower Cambrian.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In short, it is possible to hypothesize that
the entire array of living coelomate and pseudocoelomate phyla arose
near the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, and that their entry into the
fossil record occurred as they acquired hard parts or as they were
preserved by a fortuitous concomitance [</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">233</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] of circumstance. We
will not argue this hypothesis at length here, but it does Serve the
facts and may be nearly, if not precisely, correct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to living phyla, the fossil record
contains remains of extinct groups different from any living groups,
and that probably represent extinct phyla. The anatomy of some
unusual soft-bodied fossils from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale
can be reconstructed in enough detail that we can be reasonably sure
we are dealing with extinct phyla. Their body plans sometimes
resemble those of living phyla but are different enough to suggest
that they evolved separately. Ten forms are now known from the
Burgess Shale that are likely to represent extinct phyla (Conway
Moins and Whittington, 1979). Other soft-bodied fossils that probably
represent extinct phyla are known from later rocks; a particularly
distinctive form is found in the Late Carboniferous of Illinois
(Richardson, 1966). The times of origin and extinction of these
distinctive soft-bodied forms are unknown. It is possible that they
all originated during the late Precambrian-Lower Cambrian interval
and are part of a general radiation that gave rise to most or all
living phyla.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Durable skeletons distinct in architecture
from those of living phyla are also known in the fossil record. These
fossils are sometimes placed into a living phylum that they resemble,
but such assignments are often in dispute. Two of particular interest
here are the Archaeocyatha and the Hyolithida. Both appear in the
Lower Cambrian, and each has been considered an extinct phylum by
some authorities. Since the soft-part anatomies of these forms are
largely unknown, and since skeletal ground plans alone are not
necessarily definitive of relationship at the phylum level, their
status remains unclear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">If a gigantic radiation of phyla did indeed
occur near the end of the Precambrian, how can we account for it?
What triggered it, and even more importantly, what processes operated
to produce so much fundamental morphological divergence so quickly?
Reconstruction of the fauna of the Late Precambrian </FONT><I><FONT

radiation is an obvious first step toward an answer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The heading above is somewhat
facetious-because of the convention by which animals are classified,
all must belong to one phylum or another. Nevertheless most living
phyla represent clades that diversified well after the metazoans had
originated. The morphological distinctiveness believed appropriate to
phyla is based on experience with these clades, although some, such
as the Arthropoda (Tiegs and Manton, 1958), may be polyphyletic.
While Cnidarians and Platyhelminthes may be ancestral to other phyla,
the fossil record suggests that most phyla have distinctive
morphologies because they [</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">234</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] were adapted to
different modes of life rather than because they represent a chain of
ancestors and descendants arranged in some </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">scala naturae</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva">. Put
another way, the ground plans of the phyla probably did not evolve
gradually as steps or divisions on a scale of complexity, but rather
evolved relatively suddenly in response to broad adaptive
opportunities that may all have been present contemporaneously. To be
sure, some phyla descended from others, but the pattern of novel
morphology results from the quality of adaptive opportunity.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Something of the character of animals
ancestral to living phyla can be inferred from the architecture of
the latter. The body plans of living phyla fall into several
distinctive groups. These are particularly well discussed by Hyman
(1940) and Clark (1964) and are summarized in table 1. Note that the
times of appearance of these groups as fossils bear little
relationship to their presumed phylogenies. Some groups represent
different grades of construction: the diploblastic Cnidaria, the
triploblastic but acoelomate Platyheminthes, and the
pseudocoelomates, for example. Others are on the same grade of
construction but have distinctive body plans; groups of coelomates,
for example, can be identified on the basis of their coelomic
architectures (table 1 ).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Presumably the Late Precambrian fauna included
diploblastic and triploblastic acoelomate phyla (Cnidaria and
probably Platyhelminthes at least), primitive pseudocoelomates, and a
few coelomate groups ancestral to each group of living phyla that
differs by coelomic plan. The Cnidaria and Platyhelminthes, probably
largely pelagic and epifaunal, would not ordinarily leave much of a
record of their presence (we are indeed fortunate to have the
Ediacaran body fossils). Pseudocoelomates and coelomates, however,
possess body cavities that were probably evolved as hydrostatic
skeletons, an important primitive function of which was to aid in
burrowing (Clark, 1964). Burrows that disturb bedding fossilize
rather easily, so traces of early burrowing phyla might be expected.
Both horizontal and vertical burrows are reported from the Late
Precambrian. They are not all accurately dated but certainly occur
during the Ediacaran interval and possibly earlier. These burrows are
relatively rare in the Precambrian, but they increase significantly
in kind and number in the Cambrian (Crimes, 1974). It is reasonable
that the Edicaran burrows represent pseudocoelomate or (perhaps more
likely because of their larger size) coelomate stocks that are
ancestral to modern phyla (Valentine, 1973).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The exact timing of the rise of
multicellularity as a new grade of organization cannot be deduced
from the fossil record. There is little dispute as to the advantages
of this condition: increased size, longevity, homeostasis, and
ultimately complexity of cellular differentiation can stem from a
multicellular condition, permitting development of life modes
unavailable to unicells. Multicellularity arose numerous times from
unicellular lineages (Stebbins in</FONT></P>

variety of pelagic and benthic forms evolved at a simple grade of
construction (Valentine, 1977). This early multicellular radiation
must have occurred some time after the appearance of eucaryotes
(perhaps near 1400 million years ago) but before 700 million years
ago; very likely it was nearer the younger age since meiosis may have
had to be perfected in eucaryotic unicells. From products of this
early radiation, diploblastic and acoelomate triploblastic grades
arose, possibly independently but probably by evolution of the latter
from the former. These events may have occurred very near 700 million
years ago. Then body cavities evolved in triploblastic Iineages at
least twice and probably a few times, radiating to form a variety of
pseudocoelomate and coelomate clades. The coelomate radiation
produced the metamerous, oligomerous, amerous, and pseudometamerous
vermiform "superphyla" stocks from which the phyla of the Lower
Cambrian radiated in turn (or perhaps in some cases the Cambrian
phyla represent Late Precambrian holdovers). The coelomate superphyla
may have developed during the hundred-million-year interval preceding
the Cambrian. The bulk of living phyla originated in radiations from
the coelomate superphyla and from pseudocoelomate stocks probably
near 570 million years ago at the beginning of the Cambrian The
entire sequence of the origin of metazoa and the development of phyla
could have been compressed inside the 150 million years preceding the
Cambrian (although it may have taken longer). At any rate the
radiation associated with the origin of most of the clades that we
now call phyla seems to have taken only a few tens of millions of

relative scale (Ayala, 1969). Of course, all three of these fee
tures-fitness, adaptive advantage, and adaptive value-vary in
relation to the environment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Microevolution can certainly be responsible
for the origin of some new species, but it acts too slowly to account
for the origin of many species and of most higher taxa (Stanley,
1975, 1976, 1978). Since fitness must by definition be enhanced by
new genes or gene combinations for microevolution to occur, large
heterozygous genetic changes that upset the biochemistry of
development are usually lethal. Eldredge and Gould (1972) and Stanley
(1975) have shown that many fossil species (morphospecies) evolved
only slightly if at all during their existence; the morphological
changes that differ entiate them from their ancestors must have been
associated with their origins. The morphological distance achieved
during the speciation process must often be considerable, equivalent
to the morphological differences between many genera. Indeed, fossil
genera appear much too rapidly to have originated through
microevolutionary processes alone (Stanley, 1978). They must be
products of macroevolution and perhaps often of a single speciation
event. This argument has even more force when applied to higher taxa
such as orders, classes, and phyla; the time required for
microevolutionary processes to produce such distinctive morphologies
as distinguish these higher taxa (which sometimes possess different
body plans altogether) is far greater than the time available
according to the fossil record.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Macroevolution does not depend on fitness and
indeed must often circumvent it. If this can be done, then novelties
considerable different morphologically from their ancestors can arise
rapidly; their survival depends only on their adaptive value. An
example is the rapid quantum speciation possible in organisms
(chiefly plants) that are self-fertilizing. A large mutation can
produce a descendant that is infertile with members of its parental
species, including its parents. If it can fertilize itself, however,
it may propagate and thrive; whether it does or not depends on its
adaptive value. Indeed, if it should happen to have a distinct
adaptive advantage over its parent, or any other species for that
matter, due to a higher reproductive rate, greater hardiness, or some
such feature, it may eventually replace an older species
Microevolution has had very little to do with the origin or the
success of this "instant species."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In lineages that are not self-fertilizing, the
perpetuation of a marked novelty is more difficult, for it must
backcross with "normal" members of its species and pass through at
least one heterozygous generation to produce homozygotes. Since the
heterozygotes would usually have much lower fitness than normal
individuals, they must evade the winnowing effects of microselection
to produce offspring. That such evasions do happen has long been
postulated. For example, Simpson (1944, 1953) and Mayr (1942, 1963)
have both appealed to genetic "drift" in small populations as a means
[</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">239</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] of
achieving novel gene combinations in macroevolution. Fixation of
chromosomal mutations in small populations of mammals, isolated by
breeding patterns and subject to drift because of their small
effective sizes, has been reported by Bush (1975) and Bush et al.
(1977). In these mammalian examples, there appears to be little
morphological difference between the normal and mutant phenotypes,
but they do indicate how novel genotypes can be fixed despite
probable heterozygote disadvantage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The creation of form through developmental
processes has long served as an analogy to the rise of form through
evolutionary processes. Even though ontogeny does not recapitulate
phylogeny in the classic sense, there is clearly much to be learned
of evolutionary processes from the study of individual development.
In both cases, a single cell can be elaborated into a complex
organism. A complex individual may have 200 different types of cells,
such as nerve and muscle cells, each functioning in tissue and organ
systems as different as brains and biceps. Each cell (excluding
gametes and with unimportant exceptions) contains an identical
genotype. Differentiation occurs because different sets of genes
function in different cells: the genomes in each cell contain all the
information necessary to construct an entire organism, but instead
they produce only a particular cell phenotype. Switching of gene
activities on and off to obtain products from the appropriate set of
genes in the proper amounts and in the correct sequence to make the
proper number of cells of each type arrayed in a desirable form
requires an elegant regulatory system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Two main gene functions involve the production
of polypeptide products (via </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">structural</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> genes) and
control of the pattern of gene activity (via </FONT><I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">regulatory</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Geneva"> genes).
Results of regulatory gene activity are seen in differentiation among
genetically identical cells (Britten and Davidson, 1969). Some genes
have both regulatory and structural functions. All eucaryotic cells
require a rather similar set of structural genes to produce
substances required for cell growth and general cell metabolism. The
chief differences between the genomes of morphologically distinctive
metazoa seem to reside in the genetic regulatory apparatus. Although
some differences in structural functions between members of different
phyla are obvious, their distinctive body plans must arise from
different patterns of activities of their structural gene; rather
than from differences in the structural genes themselves. These
Patterns of gene expression are determined by the regulatory gene
system (Britten and Davidson, 1971; Wilson, 1975; King and Wilson,
1975 Valentine and Campbell, 1975).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">240</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Molecular details
of genetic regulation in eucaryotes have not been extensively
defined, but there are enough observational data to give some idea of
how the regulatory systems operate. In individual organisms, growth
and development are mediated by hormones. Some hormones are
polypeptides and thus are coded by structural genes, while others are
removed from direct gene action along what Stebbins (1968) has called
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Geneva">informational relays</FONT></I><FONT
FACE="Geneva">. Hormones may switch on or off large sets of genes. In
some cases, two or more hormones control an array of processes
according to their relative concentrations. Matsuda (1978) has
reviewed the activity of some hormones in arthropod development.
Morphogenesis is triggered by the hormone ED (ecdysone), the effects
of which vary according to the availability of a second hormone JH
(juvenile hormone). ED induces larval molt in the presence of large
amounts of JH, pupal molt with less JH, and imaginal molt in the
absence of JH. The inhibiting effect of JH is clear, and it has other
well-studied effects. For example, overproduction of JH late in
postembryonic development causes precocious egg maturation, resulting
in developmental neoteny. Mutations that reduce or stimulate the
production of this hormone at unusual levels or times can result in
abnormal metamorphosis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Unusual environmental stimuli can alter the
level of hormone secretion and produce abnormalities similar to those
resulting from mutations. The morphological consequences of these
developmental abnormalities can be gross, ranging from changes in
limb size and number and wing reduction or loss to the maturation of
larvae with body plans distinct from those of adults. Many examples
of regulatory gene abnormalities are known from representatives of
other phyla, including humans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The potential for large and sudden
morphological change thus clearly exists within metazoan genomes. The
problem is to translate this potential into a rapid evolutionary
event that produces descendants quite different from their ancestors
but ones that are viable and reasonably well adapted. Genetic drift
is a possible mechanism, as we have seen. Genomes suffering extensive
changes in developmental pathways to produce "monster" morphologies,
however, are likely to produce lethal heterozygotes when crossed with
normal genomes; at least this is the experience of laboratory studies
(Dobzhansky, 1971). Matsuda (1978) has suggested how this problem may
be surmounted. If a population is subjected to a novel environment
that induces unusual hormone production, many similar abnormal
phenotypes will result. This is a nongenetic origin for a novel
morphology. These novel individuals would presumably have no special
trouble in reproducing, assuming they happen to be well adapted. The
morphology could thus be propagated. Later genetic changes could then
fix the new morphology in phylogeny. These genetic changes might be
favored by microevolution because they would stabilize a phenotype
with a large adaptive value.</FONT></P>

</CENTER></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There are thus several scenarios to explain
the occurrence of sudden large morphological jumps-quantum events-in
evolution. One is microevolutionary, when mutations with large
morphological effects prove fit enough in heterozygotes that
homozygotes, which are fitter still, become common; eventually the
mutation is fixed. The case when this seems most likely to occur is
neoteny, for the developmental pathways of a mutant and of its normal
associates may remain nearly identical up to the point of
adventitious reproduction in the mutant. Heterozygotes might
therefore develop viably; if mutant homozygotes were fitter they
would eventually replace the ancestral type.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The other scenarios are all primarily
macroevolutionary in the sense that it is the adaptive value of the
novelty that permits it to endure, even though it is less fit than
the normal members of its parent species within the parental
population. One of these scenarios involves genetic drift in small,
reproductively isolated populations. Geographic isolation would be
the most common type in invertebrates, and perhaps social isolation
(inbred kin groups or harems) would be common among some higher
vertebrates. Even though heterozygotes for a mutant would be less fit
than the parental genotypes, drift would sometimes permit the
appearance of homozygotes by chance. Their subsequent success would
depend on their level of adaptation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A third scenario involves organisms that are
self-fertilizing and do not require drift to create homozygotes. For
metazoans this scenario must have limited application.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A fourth scenario involves the creation of a
new morph by environmental induction of developmental changes,
perhaps by the switching of regulatory genes through hormonal
activity. Individuals belonging to the new morph should not have
unusual genotypes, and if the new morph happens to be well adapted
there may be no reduced fertility. Subsequent genetic changes,
presumably microevolutionary, are required to fix the novelty.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Whatever the scenario, microevolution and
macroevolution play different roles (Stanley, 1975). The more
significant novelties, in which the greatest morphological changes
are involved, must be a product of a macroevolutionary mode. This
should occur most commonly when the population is suddenly faced with
a distinctively new environment. Large changes would then be
indicated because small ones would not usually suffice to maintain a
viable adaptive value. The sorts of genetic changes known to underlie
highly distinctive morphologies are those of the regulatory gene
system; many structural loci may have their expressions changed by a
mutation at a single regulatory locus. The morphological results of
regulatory changes will not be scaled to the amount required by
environmental change; they could easily be [</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">242</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] greater than
necessary. Regardless of the size of the morphological change the
survival of the novelty is first of all a function of its adaptive
value when founded. Next it would be a function of the ability of
microevolution to maintain the adaptive value at a suitably high
level to prevent extinction This may be critical and is the main
importance of microevolution. The aura tion of lineages should often
be a measure of the success of microevolutionary processes.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As an aid in thinking about the evolution of
phyla, it is useful to model the process in terms of a changing
adaptive landscape and some simple rules for diversification.
Adaptive landscapes have been used for this purpose for many years
(see McCoy, 1979, for some early examples); Simpson (1944, 1953) used
a model of adaptive zones to excellent effect in considering
macroevolution. None of the previous visualizations is quite right
for our purposes, however. We shall use a topographically featureless
plain demarcated into small irregularly shaped patches. Each patch
represents a fairly homogeneous environment. The boundaries between
patches represent environmental discontinuities so that conditions
change across patch boundaries but are relatively constant between
them. There are several classes of boundary strengths; we shall
arbitrarily specify that each succeeding increase in boundary
strength doubles the environmental change across the boundary. In
effect, the plain represents an environmental mosaic, and each patch
is an individual tessera.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Through time the environment changes; tesserae
enlarge or shrink, or coalesce as boundaries fade. Other boundaries
change their positions and intensities, and new boundaries may appear
across some tesserae. The environmental mosaic becomes an asymmetric
kaleidoscope. Heterogeneous environments have numerous small tesserae
separated by a high average boundary class; more homogeneous
environments have large tesserae separated by a low average boundary
class.</FONT></P>

episodically broadcast into the air to fall back onto the board. The
direction in which they travel is selected at random. The distance
they travel depends on two factors: their [</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">243</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] original impetus
and the strength of the tessera boundaries they happen to cross. The
original impetus may be expressed in boundary units: an impetus of 10
will take a sphere across two class five boundaries, 5 class two
boundaries, or some such mixture. The sphere then settles on the last
tessera, the airspace of which it can penetrate. The original impetus
is selected at random (with replacement) from a pool in which the
frequency distribution is previously determined (see below). The
spheres are fragile, and there are only certain tesserae scattered
randomly across the board on which any given Sphere may settle
without bursting. Furthermore, only one sphere can be accommodated on
any tessera; late newcomers burst. There is one last rule: each
sphere that successfully settles on a tessera becomes a locus for
broadcasting new spheres under conditions identical to those at the
original locus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Before starting the game we must choose a pool
of impetuses (fig. 3). We shall play three games, each with a
different pool. One involves small impetuses (fig. 3(a)); they must
be greater than 1, however, or they cannot penetrate any of the
tesserae. A second game is played with a pool of very large impetuses
(fig. 3(b)). Finally, there is a game from a pool in which most
impetuses are small but a very few are large (fig. 3(c)). The spheres
are obviously analogous to species. The impetuses are analogous to
morphological distances. Clusters of spheres with little
morphological distance represent genera or families; spheres that are
very different morphologically represent different phyla.</FONT></P>

near the original source. Each very distinctive morphology becomes
surrounded by a spreading zone occupied by spheres with minor
modifications, making it increasingly difficult for the rare spheres
from distant sources to find a suitable open tessera. Eventually, the
board fills to an equilibrium occupation level. As vacant tesserae
appear, their chances of being colonized from a distant source are
vanishingly small; they might rarely be occupied from a source at an
intermediate distance, but will most likely be filled from a closely
neighboring source. To increase the colonization chances from a far
or intermediate source, a large area of the board comprising many
tesserae must be cleared of spheres. Then, although spreading from
marginal tesserae will gradually fill the cleared region from the
edges, the central part might well receive immigrant spheres from
some distance. The larger the cleared patch, the more likely this
would be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Morphologically, the spheres could be divided
hierarchically, first into clusters of spheres descended from the
founding spheres with large impetuses; then into subclusters
descended from separate intermediate impetus spheres, daughters or
grant/daughters of the founding sphere; and then perhaps into
tertiary clusters within these and quaternary clusters Within those
and so on. Clearly, among the games we have played, this most closely
represents the hierarchical pattern of morphology on Earth.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Game 3 could be modified in a number of
obvious ways to bring it into closer conformity with life history.
For example, the density of tesserae that Could be successfully
colonized might be decreased with distance from each source tessera,
or some spheres could be permitted to occupy more than one tessera at
certain times or places, and so forth. However, the game rules
already rival those of Monopoly, and such complications do little to
clarify the basic questions of the diversification pattern of higher
taxa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The adaptive kaleidoscope involves features
that may not closely simulate life history. For example, the
morphogenetic events analogous to the large impetuses of the model
may not often or ever result from single mutations. They remain the
most mysterious parts of metazoan history. Also the model implies
that morphological and adaptive distances go hand in hand; this is
clearly not the case. Nevertheless, the model does contain some
features similar to those indicated by the fossil record, and thus it
suggests interesting hypotheses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The most striking aspect of game 3 is the
large role played by chance in determining the morphological pattern
of the phyla (and of lower taxa as well). A given tessera, or a given
region of tesserae that has low-class boundaries internally but is
demarcated by higher class boundaries, may be colonized by a
descendant of any number of ancestral spheres; that is, it may
support any number of body plans. The potential body architectures
that can function in any given habitat on Earth are clearly very
great. In the game, the first arrival that does not burst takes
possession of a tessera. If the source tessera is somewhat remote,
then the immigrant sphere must be rather novel. Empty nearby tesserae
are most likely to be colonized by descendants of the novelty since
minor novelties are so common. Therefore, the chance success of a
major novelty will commonly result in the occupation by spreading of
a large area of the gameboard by organisms with a similar body plan.
Raup and Gould (1974) have demonstrated that patterns of random
spreading of morphologies in situations much like this game result in
quite plausible family trees. If the area had been colonized from a
very different source, the major novelty of the founding lineage
would have been very different, and the subsequent inhabitants of the
area, deployed by spreading from this major novelty, would be quite
different.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Thus, in the game, the key to body-type
pattern is the chance of colonization, which is based on two factors:
the arrival of an immigrant from a distance and the viability of the
immigrant on the tessera. In nature, the latter is chiefly a matter
of chance preadaptation, but microevolutionary processes, operating
after colonization, may contribute significantly to continuing
success of the immigrant. The origin of the immigrant morphology is
not related to the conditions at what becomes the occupied tessera.
In addition to the morphological features that prove useful in the
tessera, the immigrant may possess many other features that have no
special relation to the particular conditions that distinguish the
tessera or the neighborhood of the tessera from other places. These
features may nevertheless contribute the harmonious functioning of
the organism at the time of colonization and may be retained or
perhaps modified as the immigrant is engineered to conditions on the
tessera by microevolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">249</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] From the foregoing,
it appears that prediction from first principles of the morphology of
the occupant of any given tessera would not be possible even if one
had a knowledge of the pool of morphologies from which it must arise
(assuming a reasonably large diversity of morphology within the pool)
consider a neighborhood of tesserae that represents infaunal
burrowing in marine bottom sediments. Among living phyla, a wide
variety of body plans have burrowing representatives. Most use a
hydraulic system (usually associated with a hydrostatic skeleton) to
burrow. Some Cnidaria (sea anemones) burrow by using their gut as a
hydraulic skeleton. Some phyla burrow by puncturing the substrate
with probelike organs, pulling themselves after (some sipunculids use
probosci operated by coeloms; some bivalve mollusks use a foot
operated by the haemocoel). Other phyla use peristaltic waves (some
nematodes use a pseudo-coal; some annelids use a coelom). In some
phyla, such as arthropods, burrowers use appendages, and still other
methods exist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Some of the morphologies associated with
burrowing are elegantly engineered as burrowing machinery; annelids
are a fine example (Clark 1964). Others seem to be jury-rigged, with
improvised structures and functions tacked onto basic morphologies
adapted to some different habit altogether. The burrowing
inarticulate brachiopods certainly convey this impression; although
equipped with elongate posterior pedicles containing a coelomic
cavity, they burrow anteriorly by a scissorslike motion of their
shells, aided by setae for transporting sediment particles (Thayer
and Steel-Petrovic, 1975). This is hardly an elegant approach to
burrowing, yet the fossil record indicates that these forms developed
their burrowing behavior early in the Phanerozoic and have maintained
it for several hundred million years. A theoretical morphologist
might predict that an annelidan sort of burrowing could evolve, but
he would hardly predict the inarticulate system There are several
phyla that do not and presumably have not burrowed in any significant
way (Chaetognatha and Bryozoa, for example). However, it is not safe
to conclude that their body plans preclude a burrowing habit.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The convergence of distinctive morphologies on
similar functions is not unique to burrowing functions; indeed it is
a widespread phenomenon among living phyla. A single subtidal rock
may support sessile suspension feeders belonging to several phyla and
feeding on roughly similar resources. For example, Mollusca
(mussels), Brachiopoda (articulates), Bryozoa Arthropoda (barnacles),
and Echinoderma (crinoids) have representatives with such a life
mode. Of these, bryozoans and articulate brachiopods are elegantly
adapted to this habit, as are crinoids; mussels were nicely
pre-adapted, while barnacles have passed along a tortuous adaptive
pathway. One would hardly predict a barnacle as an outcome of
arthropod radiation, even [</FONT><B><FONT
FACE="Geneva">250</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] though they are
perfectly plausible. The potential modes of life available to
primitive arthropods, given modifications extensive enough to develop
barnacles, are so broad as to preclude the prediction of any special
one that might be realized.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Clearly, many important functions can be
realized by animals with any of a wide array of body plans. The model
of game 1, filling the board gradually in small morphological steps
so that the entire planetary fauna has in the end the same basic body
plan, seems plausible. It requires an evolutionary process that does
not produce large viable morphological jumps. The modification of a
body plan to permit life in most tesserae would seem to present no
special problem, although, of course, there may be internal
constraints in some cases.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The model of game 2, filling the adaptive
landscape with forms that diverge by large morphological jumps only,
seems plausible also. There is certainly no unique fit of body plan
to tessera, and if there are general limits on modification to body
plans, they have not yet been defined.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The number of major ground plans realized on
Earth as viable animals is not known. A reasonable guess might be
between 40 and a few hundred on the level of the phylum. An important
regulator of this number is obviously the frequency distribution of
the distinctiveness of morphological novelties. The number of phyla
we have had reflects this distribution as it existed in Late
Precambrian and Lower Cambrian times. Another possible regulator of
phylum number is the rapidity and extent of environmental change,
measured against the effectiveness of microevolution in maintaining
adaptation. If environmental change is so rapid as to cause
large-scale extinctions, then large areas of the adaptive landscape
may become available for reoccupation. A phylum with low diversity
may become extinct. The probability of appearance of new phyla in the
vacated tesserae then depends on the size of the vacant area and the
frequency distribution of novel morphological distance. On Earth we
have lost a number of phyla to extinction. New classes or, more
commonly, new orders have appeared, presumably filling tesserae
vacated by extinction, but it seems that new phyla have rarely, if
ever, been evolved after the Cambrian. This does not necessarily
indicate that large regions of the adaptive landscape were never
emptied by extinction. It may mean, in part, that lineages from which
major new body plans could be given off became swamped by an
increasing number of lineages that could invade open regions of the
adaptive landscape with less significant modification, recognized not
as phyla but as lower taxa (Valentine, 1973). Even the invasion of
the terrestrial environment failed to produce a novel phylum. The
probability of a new phylum arising probably becomes lower as the old
phyla diversify.</FONT></P>

1 (fig. 7(a)) than in the others. First, the morphology of the
organisms, arising gradually from a similar unicellular ancestor and
diverging gradually as descendant lineages spread outward from the
ancestral tessera would not diverge as much from the simple
multicellular forms. Second although details would vary, the usual
pattern of morphological variation would be similar: irregularly
concentric with respect to the ancestor. More extreme cases would
arise when descendants happened to be given off chiefly in one
direction, producing a chain of morphologies extending from the
founding ancestor and snaking across the gameboard. The end member of
the chain would be more different from the founding member than in
other spreading patterns; if extinction eliminated segments of the
chain, one might recognize two or more phyla instead of just
one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In game 2 (fig. 7(b)), with only major
morphological jumps, the pattern of morphological variation would
also tend to be similar from run to run with great heterogeneity
among morphologies in any region but with the average degree of
divergence increasing away from the founding tessera. Extreme
spreading patterns-for example, radial until the board margin is
reached, then counterradial back to the inner tesserae, then radial
again, and so on -would create different patterns of divergence, but
these would be rare. A richness of morphology would appear in all
games. Occasional close similarities of body plans in two different
games would not be surprising, but the arrays of morphologies in each
game might be quite distinctive. It is likely that in separate games
the body plans of the occupants of any particular tessera would be
derived from different ancestral body plans, even though they would
display similar functions. Similarities in results from reruns of
game 2 would be greater than expected if strong constraints were
placed on the colonization pattern of a given lineage by its
morphology. Some such constraints must exist, but whether they would
force a great convergence among successive runs is uncertain. This is
an important problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Game 3 (fig. 7(c)) would also display a
similarity of patterns from run to run: a hierarchy of morphologies
would appear, varying with the frequency of large vs small branching
events (and capable of some extreme configurations). The actual body
plans representing the major morphological branches would usually
differ greatly from game to game. The major branches that arise
earliest would be more likely than later ones to resemble each other
in repeated games. The rate of major branching in time should
resemble the classic S-shaped logistic curve, but it should be
compressed into short time interval early in the game (see Sepkoyski,
1978). In this respect, early game 3 runs resemble game 2 runs. When
the tesserae finally fill up, so hat those opened by extinction are
chiefly filled from neighboring tesserae ,game 3 runs resemble game 1
runs. The occasional large patches of tesserae cleared by mass
extinction permit game 3 to develop its characteristic family tree at
lower taxonomic levels.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT

variation possible within such trees is indicated by the clade
simulations of Raup et al. (1973), in which splitting, continuation,
and termination of lineages are determined as random choices but at
fixed rates. The patterns of growth and diminution of diversity
within these simulated clades resemble patterns documented by fossils
in actual clades. Here we are interested in the pattern of
distinctness among the branches. The characteristic tree of game 3
(fig. 7(c)) is most like the pattern documented by fossils, and it
would display a richness in detailed variation in reruns.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the kaleidoscope games, the quality of
macroevolution is the most important factor in structuring the
morphological variation. It is probably a safe assumption that
macroevolution is a universal feature of life. Macroevolutionary
factors should affect multicellular diversification patterns on other
worlds, much as they do on Earth in one or another kaleidoscope game,
although the results would, of course, vary with environmental
conditions. Microevolution, on the other hand, might be an entirely
different matter elsewhere. It would certainly be different in
detail. We could not expect the same enzyme systems and probably not
the same genetic materials or cell behaviors as we find on Earth.
Meiosis as we know it would not be likely to develop in another life
system. Earthly microevolution is closely tied to the planet's
particular genetic system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The pattern of morphological variation of
animal-like organisms other worlds can run the gamut from the most
homogeneous sort resulting from game 1 to the most heterogeneous and
chaotic sort resulting from game 2. The character of the morphologies
is not strictly predictable. Certain qualities may be likely.
Cellular differentiation would seem to be a prerequisite of any true
complexity on the multicellular level. Complexity is a property that
usually develops when evolving organisms are faced with a series of
environmental challenges. It is often easier to modify by adding
something to an established structure, thus producing a complex
elaboration, than by redesigning the structure from a simpler
developmental stage. Also, given a morphology, there are more
potential variants of it that are complex than that are
simple.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Wherever we find it, complexity seems always
to be organized hierarchically (Simon, 1962). Therefore we might
expect complex morphologies to be based on a hierarchical
organization, with cells or other such modules at the base, and
higher levels analogous to tissues, organs, and organ systems.
Adaptations for maintaining a spatial place in nature-locomotory,
sessile, or floating adaptations-have shaped the body plans of most
of Earth' s phyla, and presumably it would be much the same
elsewhere. Nearly all such body plans require a contractile system;
movement is essential.</FONT></P>

amusing and not too difficult to continue in this vein, listing the
attributes required of presentable multicellular organisms, it turns
out that one is simply tabulating the basic features of multicellular
animals here on Earth. They form a logical and elegant assemblage
that excites admiration for evolution and gives aesthetic pleasure in
its results. One can only hope that the generality of their features
can someday be tested against another life system.</FONT></P>
