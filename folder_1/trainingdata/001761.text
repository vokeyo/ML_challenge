                         MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT                     
    To the Congress of the United States:
      I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1950, prepared
    in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and providing for
    reorganizations in the Federal Trade Commission. My reasons for
    transmitting this plan are stated in any accompanying general
    message.
      After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each
    reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1950 is
    necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in
    section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.
      The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan
    may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However,
    many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next
    years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared
    with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of
    these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is
    not practicable.

      House of Representatives in Congress assembled, May 9, 1961,
      pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, 63
      Stat. 203, as amended [see 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.].

                         FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION                     

                     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO DELEGATE                 
      (a) In addition to its existing authority, the Federal Trade
    Commission, hereinafter referred to as the "Commission", shall have
    the authority to delegate, by published order or rule, any of its
    functions to a division of the Commission, an individual
    Commissioner, a hearing examiner, or an employee or employee board,
    including functions with respect to hearing, determining, ordering,
    certifying, reporting or otherwise acting as to any work, business,
    or matter; Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall
    be deemed to supersede the provisions of section 7(a) of the
    Administrative Procedure Act (60 Stat. 241), as amended [see 5
    U.S.C. 556].
      (b) With respect to the delegation of any of its functions, as
    provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall
    retain a discretionary right to review the action of any such
    division of the Commission, individual Commissioner, hearing
    examiner, employee or employee board, upon its own initiative or
    upon petition of a party to or an intervenor in such action, within
    such time and in such manner as the Commission shall by rule
    prescribe: Provided, however, That the vote of a majority of the
    Commission less one member thereof shall be sufficient to bring any
    such action before the Commission for review.
      (c) Should the right to exercise such discretionary review be
    declined, or should no such review be sought within the time stated
    in the rules promulgated by the Commission, then the action of any
    such division of the Commission, individual Commissioner, hearing
    examiner, employee or employee board, shall, for all purposes,
    including appeal or review thereof, be deemed to be the action of
    the Commission.

               SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS TO THE CHAIRMAN           
      In addition to the functions transferred by the provisions of
    Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1264) [set out as a
    note under this section], there are hereby transferred from the
    Commission to the Chairman of the Commission the functions of the
    Commission with respect to the assignment of Commission personnel,
    including Commissioners, to perform such functions as may have been
    delegated by the Commission to Commission personnel, including
    Commissioners, pursuant to section 1 of this reorganization plan.

                         MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT                     
    To the Congress of the United States:
      I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961, prepared
    in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and
    providing for reorganization in the Federal Trade Commission.
      This Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961 follows upon my message of
    April 13, 1961, to the Congress of the United States. It is
    believed that the taking effect of the reorganizations included in
    this plan will provide for greater efficiency in the dispatch of
    the business of the Federal Trade Commission.
      The plan provides for greater flexibility in the handling of the
    business before the Commission, permitting its disposition at
    different levels so as better to promote its efficient dispatch.
    Thus matters both of an adjudicatory and regulatory nature may,
    depending upon their importance and their complexity, be finally
    consummated by divisions of the Commission, individual
    Commissioners, hearing examiners, and, subject to the provisions of
    section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (60 Stat. 241), by
    other employees. This will relieve the Commissioners from the
    necessity of dealing with many matters of lesser importance and
    thus conserve their time for the consideration of major matters of
    policy and planning. There is, however, reserved to the Commission
    as a whole the right to review any such decision, report or
    certification either upon its own initiative or upon the petition
    of a party or intervenor demonstrating to the satisfaction of the
    Commission the desirability of having the matter reviewed at the
    top level.
      Provision is also made, in order to maintain the fundamental
    bipartisan concept explicit in the basic statute creating the
    Commission, for mandatory review of any such decision, report or
    certification upon the vote of a majority of the Commission less
    one member.
      Inasmuch as the assignment of delegated functions in particular
    cases and with reference to particular problems to divisions of the
    Commission, to Commissioners, to hearing examiners, to employees
    and boards of employees must require continuous and flexible
    handling, depending both upon the amount and nature of the
    business, that function is placed in the Chairman by section 2 of
    the plan.
      By providing sound organizational arrangements, the taking effect
    of the reorganizations included in the accompanying reorganization
    plan will make possible more economical and expeditious
    administration of the affected functions. It is, however,
    impracticable to itemize at this time the reductions of
    expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such
    taking effect.
      After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each
    reorganization included in the reorganization plan transmitted
    herewith is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set
    forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as
    amended.
      I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to
    become effective.
                                                        John F. Kennedy.

      (1) Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and
    unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are
    hereby declared unlawful.
      (2) The Commission is hereby empowered and directed to prevent
    persons, partnerships, or corporations, except banks, savings and

    Federal credit unions described in section 57a(f)(4) of this title,

    406(b) of said Act [7 U.S.C. 227(b)], from using unfair methods of
    competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts
    or practices in or affecting commerce.
      (3) This subsection shall not apply to unfair methods of
    competition involving commerce with foreign nations (other than
    import commerce) unless - 
        (A) such methods of competition have a direct, substantial, and
      reasonably foreseeable effect -

        or on import commerce with foreign nations; or
          (ii) on export commerce with foreign nations, of a person
        engaged in such commerce in the United States; and

        (B) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of

    If this subsection applies to such methods of competition only
    because of the operation of subparagraph (A)(ii), this subsection
    shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in

      within the United States; or
        (ii) involve material conduct occurring within the United
      States.

      (B) All remedies available to the Commission with respect to
    unfair and deceptive acts or practices shall be available for acts
    and practices described in this paragraph, including restitution to
    domestic or foreign victims.
    (b) Proceeding by Commission; modifying and setting aside orders
      Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any
    such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any
    unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice
    in or affecting commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission
    that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest
    of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person,
    partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that
    respect and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a
    place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said
    complaint. The person, partnership, or corporation so complained of
    shall have the right to appear at the place and time so fixed and
    show cause why an order should not be entered by the Commission
    requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and
    desist from the violation of the law so charged in said complaint.
    Any person, partnership, or corporation may make application, and
    upon good cause shown may be allowed by the Commission to intervene
    and appear in said proceeding by counsel or in person. The
    testimony in any such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and
    filed in the office of the Commission. If upon such hearing the
    Commission shall be of the opinion that the method of competition
    or the act or practice in question is prohibited by this
    subchapter, it shall make a report in writing in which it shall
    state its findings as to the facts and shall issue and cause to be
    served on such person, partnership, or corporation an order
    requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and
    desist from using such method of competition or such act or
    practice. Until the expiration of the time allowed for filing a
    petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed within
    such time, or, if a petition for review has been filed within such
    time then until the record in the proceeding has been filed in a
    court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided, the
    Commission may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as
    it shall deem proper, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any
    report or any order made or issued by it under this section. After
    the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for
    review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time,
    the Commission may at any time, after notice and opportunity for
    hearing, reopen and alter, modify, or set aside, in whole or in
    part any report or order made or issued by it under this section,
    whenever in the opinion of the Commission conditions of fact or of
    law have so changed as to require such action or if the public
    interest shall so require, except that (1) the said person,
    partnership, or corporation may, within sixty days after service
    upon him or it of said report or order entered after such a
    reopening, obtain a review thereof in the appropriate court of
    appeals of the United States, in the manner provided in subsection
    (c) of this section; and (2) in the case of an order, the
    Commission shall reopen any such order to consider whether such
    order (including any affirmative relief provision contained in such
    order) should be altered, modified, or set aside, in whole or in
    part, if the person, partnership, or corporation involved files a
    request with the Commission which makes a satisfactory showing that
    changed conditions of law or fact require such order to be altered,
    modified, or set aside, in whole or in part. The Commission shall
    determine whether to alter, modify, or set aside any order of the
    Commission in response to a request made by a person, partnership,
    or corporation under paragraph (!1) (2) not later than 120 days
    after the date of the filing of such request.

    (c) Review of order; rehearing
      Any person, partnership, or corporation required by an order of
    the Commission to cease and desist from using any method of
    competition or act or practice may obtain a review of such order in
    the court of appeals of the United States, within any circuit where
    the method of competition or the act or practice in question was
    used or where such person, partnership, or corporation resides or
    carries on business, by filing in the court, within sixty days from
    the date of the service of such order, a written petition praying
    that the order of the Commission be set aside. A copy of such
    petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court
    to the Commission, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the
    court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of
    title 28. Upon such filing of the petition the court shall have
    jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined
    therein concurrently with the Commission until the filing of the
    record and shall have power to make and enter a decree affirming,
    modifying, or setting aside the order of the Commission, and
    enforcing the same to the extent that such order is affirmed and to
    issue such writs as are ancillary to its jurisdiction or are
    necessary in its judgement to prevent injury to the public or to
    competitors pendente lite. The findings of the Commission as to the
    facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive. To the extent
    that the order of the Commission is affirmed, the court shall
    thereupon issue its own order commanding obedience to the terms of
    such order of the Commission. If either party shall apply to the
    court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to
    the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is
    material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to
    adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the
    court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the
    Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and
    upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The
    Commission may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new
    findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it
    shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by
    evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for
    the modification or setting aside of its original order, with the
    return of such additional evidence. The judgment and decree of the
    court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to
    review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari, as provided in section
    1254 of title 28.
    (d) Jurisdiction of court
      Upon the filing of the record with it the jurisdiction of the
    court of appeals of the United States to affirm, enforce, modify,
    or set aside orders of the Commission shall be exclusive.
    (e) Exemption from liability
      No order of the Commission or judgement of court to enforce the
    same shall in anywise relieve or absolve any person, partnership,
    or corporation from any liability under the Antitrust Acts.
    (f) Service of complaints, orders and other processes; return
      Complaints, orders, and other processes of the Commission under
    this section may be served by anyone duly authorized by the
    Commission, either (a) by delivering a copy thereof to the person
    to be served, or to a member of the partnership to be served, or
    the president, secretary, or other executive officer or a director
    of the corporation to be served; or (b) by leaving a copy thereof
    at the residence or the principal office or place of business of
    such person, partnership, or corporation; or (c) by mailing a copy
    thereof by registered mail or by certified mail addressed to such
    person, partnership, or corporation at his or its residence or
    principal office or place of business. The verified return by the
    person so serving said complaint, order, or other process setting
    forth the manner of said service shall be proof of the same, and
    the return post office receipt for said complaint, order, or other
    process mailed by registered mail or by certified mail as aforesaid
    shall be proof of the service of the same.
    (g) Finality of order
      An order of the Commission to cease and desist shall become final
    - 
        (1) Upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a
      petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed
      within such time; but the Commission may thereafter modify or set
      aside its order to the extent provided in the last sentence of
      subsection (b).
        (2) Except as to any order provision subject to paragraph (4),
      upon the sixtieth day after such order is served, if a petition
      for review has been duly filed; except that any such order may be
      stayed, in whole or in part and subject to such conditions as may
      be appropriate, by - 
          (A) the Commission;
          (B) an appropriate court of appeals of the United States, if
        (i) a petition for review of such order is pending in such
        court, and (ii) an application for such a stay was previously
        submitted to the Commission and the Commission, within the 30-
        day period beginning on the date the application was received
        by the Commission, either denied the application or did not
        grant or deny the application; or
          (C) the Supreme Court, if an applicable petition for
        certiorari is pending.

        (3) For purposes of subsection (m)(1)(B) of this section and of
      section 57b(a)(2) of this title, if a petition for review of the
      order of the Commission has been filed - 
          (A) upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a
        petition for certiorari, if the order of the Commission has
        been affirmed or the petition for review has been dismissed by
        the court of appeals and no petition for certiorari has been
        duly filed;
          (B) upon the denial of a petition for certiorari, if the
        order of the Commission has been affirmed or the petition for
        review has been dismissed by the court of appeals; or
          (C) upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance
        of a mandate of the Supreme Court directing that the order of
        the Commission be affirmed or the petition for review be
        dismissed.

        (4) In the case of an order provision requiring a person,
      partnership, or corporation to divest itself of stock, other
      share capital, or assets, if a petition for review of such order
      of the Commission has been filed - 
          (A) upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a
        petition for certiorari, if the order of the Commission has
        been affirmed or the petition for review has been dismissed by
        the court of appeals and no petition for certiorari has been
        duly filed;
          (B) upon the denial of a petition for certiorari, if the
        order of the Commission has been affirmed or the petition for
        review has been dismissed by the court of appeals; or
          (C) upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance
        of a mandate of the Supreme Court directing that the order of
        the Commission be affirmed or the petition for review be
        dismissed.
    (h) Modification or setting aside of order by Supreme Court
      If the Supreme Court directs that the order of the Commission be
    modified or set aside, the order of the Commission rendered in
    accordance with the mandate of the Supreme Court shall become final
    upon the expiration of thirty days from the time it was rendered,
    unless within such thirty days either party has instituted
    proceedings to have such order corrected to accord with the
    mandate, in which event the order of the Commission shall become
    final when so corrected.
    (i) Modification or setting aside of order by Court of Appeals
      If the order of the Commission is modified or set aside by the
    court of appeals, and if (1) the time allowed for filing a petition
    for certiorari has expired and no such petition has been duly
    filed, or (2) the petition for certiorari has been denied, or (3)
    the decision of the court has been affirmed by the Supreme Court,
    then the order of the Commission rendered in accordance with the
    mandate of the court of appeals shall become final on the
    expiration of thirty days from the time such order of the
    Commission was rendered, unless within such thirty days either
    party has instituted proceedings to have such order corrected so
    that it will accord with the mandate, in which event the order of
    the Commission shall become final when so corrected.
    (j) Rehearing upon order or remand
      If the Supreme Court orders a rehearing; or if the case is
    remanded by the court of appeals to the Commission for a rehearing,
    and if (1) the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari
    has expired, and no such petition has been duly filed, or (2) the
    petition for certiorari has been denied, or (3) the decision of the
    court has been affirmed by the Supreme Court, then the order of the
    Commission rendered upon such rehearing shall become final in the
    same manner as though no prior order of the Commission had been
    rendered.
    (k) "Mandate" defined
      As used in this section the term "mandate", in case a mandate has
    been recalled prior to the expiration of thirty days from the date
    of issuance thereof, means the final mandate.
    (l) Penalty for violation of order; injunctions and other
      appropriate equitable relief
      Any person, partnership, or corporation who violates an order of
    the Commission after it has become final, and while such order is
    in effect, shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil
    penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation, which shall
    accrue to the United States and may be recovered in a civil action
    brought by the Attorney General of the United States. Each separate
    violation of such an order shall be a separate offense, except that
    in a case of a violation through continuing failure to obey or
    neglect to obey a final order of the Commission, each day of
    continuance of such failure or neglect shall be deemed a separate
    offense. In such actions, the United States district courts are
    empowered to grant mandatory injunctions and such other and further
    equitable relief as they deem appropriate in the enforcement of
    such final orders of the Commission.
    (m) Civil actions for recovery of penalties for knowing violations
      of rules and cease and desist orders respecting unfair or
      deceptive acts or practices; jurisdiction; maximum amount of
      penalties; continuing violations; de novo determinations;
      compromise or settlement procedure
      (1)(A) The Commission may commence a civil action to recover a
    civil penalty in a district court of the United States against any
    person, partnership, or corporation which violates any rule under
    this chapter respecting unfair or deceptive acts or practices
    (other than an interpretive rule or a rule violation of which the
    Commission has provided is not an unfair or deceptive act or
    practice in violation of subsection (a)(1) of this section) with
    actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of
    objective circumstances that such act is unfair or deceptive and is
    prohibited by such rule. In such action, such person, partnership,
    or corporation shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than
    $10,000 for each violation.
      (B) If the Commission determines in a proceeding under subsection
    (b) of this section that any act or practice is unfair or
    deceptive, and issues a final cease and desist order, other than a
    consent order, with respect to such act or practice, then the
    Commission may commence a civil action to obtain a civil penalty in
    a district court of the United States against any person,
    partnership, or corporation which engages in such act or practice -
    
        (1) after such cease and desist order becomes final (whether or
      not such person, partnership, or corporation was subject to such
      cease and desist order), and
        (2) with actual knowledge that such act or practice is unfair
      or deceptive and is unlawful under subsection (a)(1) of this
      section.

    In such action, such person, partnership, or corporation shall be
    liable for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each
    violation.
      (C) In the case of a violation through continuing failure to
    comply with a rule or with subsection (a)(1) of this section, each
    day of continuance of such failure shall be treated as a separate
    violation, for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B). In
    determining the amount of such a civil penalty, the court shall
    take into account the degree of culpability, any history of prior
    such conduct, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do
    business, and such other matters as justice may require.
      (2) If the cease and desist order establishing that the act or
    practice is unfair or deceptive was not issued against the
    defendant in a civil penalty action under paragraph (1)(B) the
    issues of fact in such action against such defendant shall be tried
    de novo. Upon request of any party to such an action against such
    defendant, the court shall also review the determination of law
    made by the Commission in the proceeding under subsection (b) of
    this section that the act or practice which was the subject of such
    proceeding constituted an unfair or deceptive act or practice in
    violation of subsection (a) of this section.
      (3) The Commission may compromise or settle any action for a
    civil penalty if such compromise or settlement is accompanied by a
    public statement of its reasons and is approved by the court.
    (n) Standard of proof; public policy considerations
      The Commission shall have no authority under this section or
    section 57a of this title to declare unlawful an act or practice on
    the grounds that such act or practice is unfair unless the act or
    practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to
    consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves
    and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to
    competition. In determining whether an act or practice is unfair,
    the Commission may consider established public policies as evidence
    to be considered with all other evidence. Such public policy
    considerations may not serve as a primary basis for such
    determination.

                       PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
      Section 408(a), (b) of Pub. L. 93-153 provided that:
      "(a)(1) The Congress hereby finds that the investigative and law
    enforcement responsibilities of the Federal Trade Commission have
    been restricted and hampered because of inadequate legal authority
    to enforce subpenas and to seek preliminary injunctive relief to
    avoid unfair competitive practices.
      "(2) The Congress further finds that as a direct result of this
    inadequate legal authority significant delays have occurred in a
    major investigation into the legality of the structure, conduct,
    and activities of the petroleum industry, as well as in other major
    investigations designed to protect the public interest.
      "(b) It is the purpose of this Act [amending this section and
    sections 46, 53, and 56 of this title] to grant the Federal Trade
    Commission the requisite authority to insure prompt enforcement of
    the laws the Commission administers by granting statutory authority
    to directly enforce subpenas issued by the Commission and to seek
    preliminary injunctive relief to avoid unfair competitive
    practices."

    of this Act [amending this section] to protect the rights of States
    under the United States Constitution to regulate their internal
    affairs and more particularly to enact statutes and laws, and to
    adopt policies, which authorize contracts and agreements
    prescribing minimum or stipulated prices for the resale of
    commodities and to extend the minimum or stipulated prices
    prescribed by such contracts and agreements to persons who are not
    parties thereto. It is the further purpose of this Act to permit
    such statutes, laws, and public policies to apply to commodities,
    contracts, agreements, and activities in or affecting interstate or
    foreign commerce."

    Sec. 45a. Labels on products

-STATUTE-
      To the extent any person introduces, delivers for introduction,
    sells, advertises, or offers for sale in commerce a product with a
    "Made in the U.S.A." or "Made in America" label, or the equivalent
    thereof, in order to represent that such product was in whole or
    substantial part of domestic origin, such label shall be consistent
    with decisions and orders of the Federal Trade Commission issued
    pursuant to section 45 of this title. This section only applies to
    such labels. Nothing in this section shall preclude the application
    of other provisions of law relating to labeling. The Commission may
    periodically consider an appropriate percentage of imported
    components which may be included in the product and still be
    reasonably consistent with such decisions and orders. Nothing in
    this section shall preclude use of such labels for products that
    contain imported components under the label when the label also
    discloses such information in a clear and conspicuous manner. The
    Commission shall administer this section pursuant to section 45 of
    this title and may from time to time issue rules pursuant to
    section 553 of title 5 for such purpose. If a rule is issued, such
    violation shall be treated by the Commission as a violation of a
    rule under section 57a of this title regarding unfair or deceptive
    acts or practices. This section shall be effective upon publication
    in the Federal Register of a Notice of the provisions of this
    section. The Commission shall publish such notice within six months
    after September 13, 1994.

    trade secret or any commercial or financial information which is

    except that the Commission may disclose such information (1) to
    officers and employees of appropriate Federal law enforcement
    agencies or to any officer or employee of any State law enforcement

    Federal or State law enforcement agency that such information will
    be maintained in confidence and will be used only for official law
    enforcement purposes, and (2) to any officer or employee of any
    foreign law enforcement agency under the same circumstances that
    making material available to foreign law enforcement agencies is
    permitted under section 57b-2(b) of this title.
    (g) Classification of corporations; regulations
      From time to time classify corporations and (except as provided

    (h) Investigations of foreign trade conditions; reports
      To investigate, from time to time, trade conditions in and with
    foreign countries where associations, combinations, or practices of
    manufacturers, merchants, or traders, or other conditions, may
    affect the foreign trade of the United States, and to report to
    Congress thereon, with such recommendations as it deems advisable.
    (i) Investigations of foreign antitrust law violations
      With respect to the International Antitrust Enforcement
    Assistance Act of 1994 [15 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.], to conduct
    investigations of possible violations of foreign antitrust laws (as
    defined in section 12 of such Act [15 U.S.C. 6211]).
    (j) Investigative assistance for foreign law enforcement agencies
      (1) In general
        Upon a written request from a foreign law enforcement agency to
      provide assistance in accordance with this subsection, if the
      requesting agency states that it is investigating, or engaging in
      enforcement proceedings against, possible violations of laws
      prohibiting fraudulent or deceptive commercial practices, or
      other practices substantially similar to practices prohibited by
      any provision of the laws administered by the Commission, other
      than Federal antitrust laws (as defined in section 12(5) of the
      International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act of 1994 (15
      U.S.C. 6211(5))), to provide the assistance described in
      paragraph (2) without requiring that the conduct identified in
      the request constitute a violation of the laws of the United
      States.
      (2) Type of assistance
        In providing assistance to a foreign law enforcement agency
      under this subsection, the Commission may - 
          (A) conduct such investigation as the Commission deems
        necessary to collect information and evidence pertinent to the
        request for assistance, using all investigative powers
        authorized by this subchapter; and
          (B) when the request is from an agency acting to investigate
        or pursue the enforcement of civil laws, or when the Attorney
        General refers a request to the Commission from an agency
        acting to investigate or pursue the enforcement of criminal
        laws, seek and accept appointment by a United States district
        court of Commission attorneys to provide assistance to foreign
        and international tribunals and to litigants before such
        tribunals on behalf of a foreign law enforcement agency
        pursuant to section 1782 of title 28.
      (3) Criteria for determination
        In deciding whether to provide such assistance, the Commission
      shall consider all relevant factors, including - 
          (A) whether the requesting agency has agreed to provide or
        will provide reciprocal assistance to the Commission;
          (B) whether compliance with the request would prejudice the
        public interest of the United States; and
          (C) whether the requesting agency's investigation or
        enforcement proceeding concerns acts or practices that cause or
        are likely to cause injury to a significant number of persons.
      (4) International agreements
        If a foreign law enforcement agency has set forth a legal basis
      for requiring execution of an international agreement as a
      condition for reciprocal assistance, or as a condition for
      provision of materials or information to the Commission, the
      Commission, with prior approval and ongoing oversight of the
      Secretary of State, and with final approval of the agreement by
      the Secretary of State, may negotiate and conclude an
      international agreement, in the name of either the United States
      or the Commission, for the purpose of obtaining such assistance,
      materials, or information. The Commission may undertake in such
      an international agreement to - 
          (A) provide assistance using the powers set forth in this
        subsection;
          (B) disclose materials and information in accordance with
        subsection (f) and section 57b-2(b) of this title; and
          (C) engage in further cooperation, and protect materials and
        information received from disclosure, as authorized by this
        subchapter.
      (5) Additional authority
        The authority provided by this subsection is in addition to,
      and not in lieu of, any other authority vested in the Commission
      or any other officer of the United States.
      (6) Limitation
        The authority granted by this subsection shall not authorize
      the Commission to take any action or exercise any power with
      respect to a bank, a savings and loan institution described in
      section 57a(f)(3) of this title, a Federal credit union described
      in section 57a(f)(4) of this title, or a common carrier subject
      to the Act to regulate commerce, except in accordance with the
      undesignated proviso following the last designated subsection of
      this section.
      (7) Assistance to certain countries
        The Commission may not provide investigative assistance under
      this subsection to a foreign law enforcement agency from a
      foreign state that the Secretary of State has determined, in
      accordance with section 2405(j) of the Appendix to title 50, has
      repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,
      unless and until such determination is rescinded pursuant to
      section 2405(j)(4) of the Appendix to title 50.
    (k) Referral of evidence for criminal proceedings
      (1) In general
        Whenever the Commission obtains evidence that any person,

    Provided, That the exception of "banks, savings and loan
    institutions described in section 57a(f)(3) of this title, Federal
    credit unions described in section 57a(f)(4) of this title, and
    common carriers subject to the Act to regulate commerce" from the
    Commission's powers defined in subsections (a), (b), and (j) of
    this section, shall not be construed to limit the Commission's
    authority to gather and compile information, to investigate, or to
    require reports or answers from, any person, partnership, or
    corporation to the extent that such action is necessary to the
    investigation of any person, partnership, or corporation, group of
    persons, partnerships, or corporations, or industry which is not
    engaged or is engaged only incidentally in banking, in business as
    a savings and loan institution, in business as a Federal credit
    union, or in business as a common carrier subject to the Act to
    regulate commerce.
      The Commission shall establish a plan designed to substantially
    reduce burdens imposed upon small businesses as a result of
    requirements established by the Commission under clause (b)
    relating to the filing of quarterly financial reports. Such plan
    shall (1) be established after consultation with small businesses
    and persons who use the information contained in such quarterly
    financial reports; (2) provide for a reduction of the number of
    small businesses required to file such quarterly financial reports;
    and (3) make revisions in the forms used for such quarterly
    financial reports for the purpose of reducing the complexity of
    such forms. The Commission, not later than December 31, 1980, shall
    submit such plan to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
    Transportation of the Senate and to the Committee on Energy and
    Commerce of the House of Representatives. Such plan shall take
    effect not later than October 31, 1981.
      No officer or employee of the Commission or any Commissioner may
    publish or disclose information to the public, or to any Federal
    agency, whereby any line-of-business data furnished by a particular
    establishment or individual can be identified. No one other than
    designated sworn officers and employees of the Commission may
    examine the line-of-business reports from individual firms, and
    information provided in the line-of-business program administered
    by the Commission shall be used only for statistical purposes.
    Information for carrying out specific law enforcement
    responsibilities of the Commission shall be obtained under
    practices and procedures in effect on May 28, 1980, or as changed
    by law.
      Nothing in this section (other than the provisions of clause (c)
    and clause (d)) shall apply to the business of insurance, except
    that the Commission shall have authority to conduct studies and
    prepare reports relating to the business of insurance. The
    Commission may exercise such authority only upon receiving a
    request which is agreed to by a majority of the members of the
    Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate or
    the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
    Representatives. The authority to conduct any such study shall
    expire at the end of the Congress during which the request for such
    study was made.

    Sec. 49. Documentary evidence; depositions; witnesses

-STATUTE-
      For the purposes of this subchapter the Commission, or its duly
    authorized agent or agents, shall at all reasonable times have
    access to, for the purpose of examination, and the right to copy
    any documentary evidence of any person, partnership, or corporation
    being investigated or proceeded against; and the Commission shall
    have power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of
    witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence
    relating to any matter under investigation. Any member of the
    Commission may sign subpoenas, and members and examiners of the
    Commission may administer oaths and affirmations, examine
    witnesses, and receive evidence.
      Such attendance of witnesses, and the production of such
    documentary evidence, may be required from any place in the United
    States, at any designated place of hearing. And in case of
    disobedience to a subpoena the Commission may invoke the aid of any
    court of the United States in requiring the attendance and
    testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence.
      Any of the district courts of the United States within the
    jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on may, in case of
    contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person,
    partnership, or corporation issue an order requiring such person,
    partnership, or corporation to appear before the Commission, or to
    produce documentary evidence if so ordered, or to give evidence
    touching the matter in question; and any failure to obey such order
    of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.
      Upon the application of the Attorney General of the United

-STATUTE-
      Any person who shall neglect or refuse to attend and testify, or
    to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce any documentary
    evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to an order of a
    district court of the United States directing compliance with the
    subpoena or lawful requirement of the Commission, shall be guilty
    of an offense and upon conviction thereof by a court of competent
    jurisdiction shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1,000
    nor more than $5,000, or by imprisonment for not more than one
    year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
      Any person who shall willfully make, or cause to be made, any
    false entry or statement of fact in any report required to be made
    under this subchapter, or who shall willfully make, or cause to be
    made, any false entry in any account, record, or memorandum kept by

    or who shall willfully neglect or fail to make, or to cause to be
    made, full, true, and correct entries in such accounts, records, or

    willfully remove out of the jurisdiction of the United States, or
    willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any
    documentary evidence of such person, partnership, or corporation,
    or who shall willfully refuse to submit to the Commission or to any
    of its authorized agents, for the purpose of inspection and taking
    copies, any documentary evidence of such person, partnership, or
    corporation in his possession or within his control, shall be
    deemed guilty of an offense against the United States, and shall be

    years, or to both such fine and imprisonment.
      If any persons, partnership, or corporation required by this
    subchapter to file any annual or special report shall fail so to do
    within the time fixed by the Commission for filing the same, and
    such failure shall continue for thirty days after notice of such
    default, the corporation shall forfeit to the United States the sum
    of $100 for each and every day of the continuance of such failure,
    which forfeiture shall be payable into the Treasury of the United
    States, and shall be recoverable in a civil suit in the name of the

    in the district where the corporation or partnership has its
    principal office or in any district in which it shall do business,
    and in the case of any person in the district where such person

    recovery of the forfeitures. The costs and expenses of such
    prosecution shall be paid out of the appropriation for the expenses
    of the courts of the United States.

    any information obtained by the Commission without its authority,
    unless directed by a court, shall be deemed guilty of a
    misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a
    fine not exceeding $5,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding one
    year, or by fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 53. False advertisements; injunctions and restraining orders

-STATUTE-
    (a) Power of Commission; jurisdiction of courts
      Whenever the Commission has reason to believe - 
        (1) that any person, partnership, or corporation is engaged in,
      or is about to engage in, the dissemination or the causing of the
      dissemination of any advertisement in violation of section 52 of
      this title, and
        (2) that the enjoining thereof pending the issuance of a
      complaint by the Commission under section 45 of this title, and
      until such complaint is dismissed by the Commission or set aside
      by the court on review, or the order of the Commission to cease
      and desist made thereon has become final within the meaning of
      section 45 of this title, would be to the interest of the public,

    the Commission by any of its attorneys designated by it for such
    purpose may bring suit in a district court of the United States or
    in the United States court of any Territory, to enjoin the
    dissemination or the causing of the dissemination of such
    advertisement. Upon proper showing a temporary injunction or
    restraining order shall be granted without bond. Any suit may be
    brought where such person, partnership, or corporation resides or
    transacts business, or wherever venue is proper under section 1391
    of title 28. In addition, the court may, if the court determines
    that the interests of justice require that any other person,
    partnership, or corporation should be a party in such suit, cause
    such other person, partnership, or corporation to be added as a
    party without regard to whether venue is otherwise proper in the
    district in which the suit is brought. In any suit under this
    section, process may be served on any person, partnership, or
    corporation wherever it may be found.
    (b) Temporary restraining orders; preliminary injunctions
      Whenever the Commission has reason to believe - 
        (1) that any person, partnership, or corporation is violating,
      or is about to violate, any provision of law enforced by the
      Federal Trade Commission, and
        (2) that the enjoining thereof pending the issuance of a
      complaint by the Commission and until such complaint is dismissed
      by the Commission or set aside by the court on review, or until
      the order of the Commission made thereon has become final, would
      be in the interest of the public - 

    the Commission by any of its attorneys designated by it for such
    purpose may bring suit in a district court of the United States to
    enjoin any such act or practice. Upon a proper showing that,
    weighing the equities and considering the Commission's likelihood
    of ultimate success, such action would be in the public interest,
    and after notice to the defendant, a temporary restraining order or
    a preliminary injunction may be granted without bond: Provided,
    however, That if a complaint is not filed within such period (not
    exceeding 20 days) as may be specified by the court after issuance
    of the temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, the
    order or injunction shall be dissolved by the court and be of no
    further force and effect: Provided further, That in proper cases
    the Commission may seek, and after proper proof, the court may
    issue, a permanent injunction. Any suit may be brought where such
    person, partnership, or corporation resides or transacts business,
    or wherever venue is proper under section 1391 of title 28. In
    addition, the court may, if the court determines that the interests
    of justice require that any other person, partnership, or
    corporation should be a party in such suit, cause such other
    person, partnership, or corporation to be added as a party without
    regard to whether venue is otherwise proper in the district in
    which the suit is brought. In any suit under this section, process
    may be served on any person, partnership, or corporation wherever
    it may be found.
    (c) Service of process; proof of service
      Any process of the Commission under this section may be served by
    any person duly authorized by the Commission - 
        (1) by delivering a copy of such process to the person to be
      served, to a member of the partnership to be served, or to the
      president, secretary, or other executive officer or a director of
      the corporation to be served;
        (2) by leaving a copy of such process at the residence or the
      principal office or place of business of such person,
      partnership, or corporation; or
        (3) by mailing a copy of such process by registered mail or
      certified mail addressed to such person, partnership, or
      corporation at his, or her, or its residence, principal office,
      or principal place or business.

    The verified return by the person serving such process setting
    forth the manner of such service shall be proof of the same.
    (d) Exception of periodical publications
      Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the court in the case
    of a newspaper, magazine, periodical, or other publication,
    published at regular intervals - 
        (1) that restraining the dissemination of a false advertisement
      in any particular issue of such publication would delay the
      delivery of such issue after the regular time therefor, and
        (2) that such delay would be due to the method by which the
      manufacture and distribution of such publication is customarily
      conducted by the publisher in accordance with sound business
      practice, and not to any method or device adopted for the evasion
      of this section or to prevent or delay the issuance of an
      injunction or restraining order with respect to such false
      advertisement or any other advertisement,

    the court shall exclude such issue from the operation of the
    restraining order or injunction.

      proceedings

    partnership, or corporation is liable for a criminal penalty under
    this subchapter, the Commission shall certify the facts to the
    Attorney General, whose duty it shall be to cause appropriate
    criminal proceedings to be brought.
    (c) Foreign litigation

      (1) Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the
    Commission may prescribe - 
        (A) interpretive rules and general statements of policy with
      respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting
      commerce (within the meaning of section 45(a)(1) of this title),

      except that the Commission shall not develop or promulgate any
      trade rule or regulation with regard to the regulation of the
      development and utilization of the standards and certification
      activities pursuant to this section. Rules under this
      subparagraph may include requirements prescribed for the purpose

    title). The preceding sentence shall not affect any authority of
    the Commission to prescribe rules (including interpretive rules),
    and general statements of policy, with respect to unfair methods of
    competition in or affecting commerce.
    (b) Procedures applicable
      (1) When prescribing a rule under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this
    section, the Commission shall proceed in accordance with section
    553 of title 5 (without regard to any reference in such section to
    sections 556 and 557 of such title), and shall also (A) publish a
    notice of proposed rulemaking stating with particularity the text
    of the rule, including any alternatives, which the Commission
    proposes to promulgate, and the reason for the proposed rule; (B)
    allow interested persons to submit written data, views, and
    arguments, and make all such submissions publicly available; (C)
    provide an opportunity for an informal hearing in accordance with
    subsection (c) of this section; and (D) promulgate, if appropriate,
    a final rule based on the matter in the rulemaking record (as

    statement of basis and purpose.
      (2)(A) Prior to the publication of any notice of proposed
    rulemaking pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), the Commission shall
    publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal
    Register. Such advance notice shall - 
        (i) contain a brief description of the area of inquiry under
      consideration, the objectives which the Commission seeks to
      achieve, and possible regulatory alternatives under consideration

      such proposed rulemaking, including any suggestions or
      alternative methods for achieving such objectives.

      (B) The Commission shall submit such advance notice of proposed
    rulemaking to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
    Transportation of the Senate and to the Committee on Energy and
    Commerce of the House of Representatives. The Commission may use
    such additional mechanisms as the Commission considers useful to
    obtain suggestions regarding the content of the area of inquiry
    before the publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking
    under paragraph (1)(A).
      (C) The Commission shall, 30 days before the publication of a
    notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), submit

    Transportation of the Senate and to the Committee on Energy and
    Commerce of the House of Representatives.
      (3) The Commission shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking
    pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) only where it has reason to believe
    that the unfair or deceptive acts or practices which are the
    subject of the proposed rulemaking are prevalent. The Commission
    shall make a determination that unfair or deceptive acts or
    practices are prevalent under this paragraph only if - 
        (A) it has issued cease and desist orders regarding such acts
      or practices, or
        (B) any other information available to the Commission indicates
      a widespread pattern of unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
    (c) Informal hearing procedure
      The Commission shall conduct any informal hearings required by
    subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section in accordance with the
    following procedure:
        (1)(A) The Commission shall provide for the conduct of
      proceedings under this subsection by hearing officers who shall
      perform their functions in accordance with the requirements of
      this subsection.
        (B) The officer who presides over the rulemaking proceedings
      shall be responsible to a chief presiding officer who shall not
      be responsible to any other officer or employee of the
      Commission. The officer who presides over the rulemaking
      proceeding shall make a recommended decision based upon the
      findings and conclusions of such officer as to all relevant and
      material evidence, except that such recommended decision may be
      made by another officer if the officer who presided over the
      proceeding is no longer available to the Commission.
        (C) Except as required for the disposition of ex parte matters
      as authorized by law, no presiding officer shall consult any
      person or party with respect to any fact in issue unless such
      officer gives notice and opportunity for all parties to
      participate.
        (2) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, an interested
      person is entitled - 
          (A) to present his position orally or by documentary
        submission (or both), and
          (B) if the Commission determines that there are disputed
        issues of material fact it is necessary to resolve, to present
        such rebuttal submissions and to conduct (or have conducted
        under paragraph (3)(B)) such cross-examination of persons as
        the Commission determines (i) to be appropriate, and (ii) to be
        required for a full and true disclosure with respect to such
        issues.

        (3) The Commission may prescribe such rules and make such
      rulings concerning proceedings in such hearings as may tend to
      avoid unnecessary costs or delay. Such rules or rulings may
      include (A) imposition of reasonable time limits on each
      interested person's oral presentations, and (B) requirements that
      any cross-examination to which a person may be entitled under
      paragraph (2) be conducted by the Commission on behalf of that
      person in such manner as the Commission determines (i) to be
      appropriate, and (ii) to be required for a full and true
      disclosure with respect to disputed issues of material fact.
        (4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if a group of
      persons each of whom under paragraphs (2) and (3) would be
      entitled to conduct (or have conducted) cross-examination and who
      are determined by the Commission to have the same or similar
      interests in the proceeding cannot agree upon a single
      representative of such interests for purposes of cross-
      examination, the Commission may make rules and rulings (i)
      limiting the representation of such interest, for such purposes,
      and (ii) governing the manner in which such cross-examination
      shall be limited.
        (B) When any person who is a member of a group with respect to
      which the Commission has made a determination under subparagraph
      (A) is unable to agree upon group representation with the other
      members of the group, then such person shall not be denied under
      the authority of subparagraph (A) the opportunity to conduct (or
      have conducted) cross-examination as to issues affecting his
      particular interests if (i) he satisfies the Commission that he
      has made a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement
      upon group representation with the other members of the group and
      (ii) the Commission determines that there are substantial and
      relevant issues which are not adequately presented by the group
      representative.
        (5) A verbatim transcript shall be taken of any oral
      presentation, and cross-examination, in an informal hearing to

    (d) Statement of basis and purpose accompanying rule; "Commission"
      defined; judicial review of amendment or repeal of rule;
      violation of rule
      (1) The Commission's statement of basis and purpose to accompany
    a rule promulgated under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section shall
    include (A) a statement as to the prevalence of the acts or
    practices treated by the rule; (B) a statement as to the manner and
    context in which such acts or practices are unfair or deceptive;
    and (C) a statement as to the economic effect of the rule, taking
    into account the effect on small business and consumers.
      (2)(A) The term "Commission" as used in this subsection and
    subsections (b) and (c) of this section includes any person
    authorized to act in behalf of the Commission in any part of the
    rulemaking proceeding.
      (B) A substantive amendment to, or repeal of, a rule promulgated
    under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section shall be prescribed, and
    subject to judicial review, in the same manner as a rule prescribed
    under such subsection. An exemption under subsection (g) of this
    section shall not be treated as an amendment or repeal of a rule.
      (3) When any rule under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section
    takes effect a subsequent violation thereof shall constitute an
    unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of section
    45(a)(1) of this title, unless the Commission otherwise expressly
    provides in such rule.
    (e) Judicial review; petition; jurisdiction and venue; rulemaking
      record; additional submissions and presentations; scope of review
      and relief; review by Supreme Court; additional remedies
      (1)(A) Not later than 60 days after a rule is promulgated under
    subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section by the Commission, any
    interested person (including a consumer or consumer organization)
    may file a petition, in the United States Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia circuit or for the circuit in which such
    person resides or has his principal place of business, for judicial
    review of such rule. Copies of the petition shall be forthwith
    transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission or other
    officer designated by it for that purpose. The provisions of
    section 2112 of title 28 shall apply to the filing of the
    rulemaking record of proceedings on which the Commission based its
    rule and to the transfer of proceedings in the courts of appeals.
      (B) For purposes of this section, the term "rulemaking record"
    means the rule, its statement of basis and purpose, the transcript
    required by subsection (c)(5) of this section, any written
    submissions, and any other information which the Commission
    considers relevant to such rule.
      (2) If the petitioner or the Commission applies to the court for
    leave to make additional oral submissions or written presentations
    and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such submissions
    and presentations would be material and that there were reasonable
    grounds for the submissions and failure to make such submissions
    and presentations in the proceeding before the Commission, the
    court may order the Commission to provide additional opportunity to
    make such submissions and presentations. The Commission may modify
    or set aside its rule or make a new rule by reason of the
    additional submissions and presentations and shall file such
    modified or new rule, and the rule's statement of basis of purpose,
    with the return of such submissions and presentations. The court
    shall thereafter review such new or modified rule.
      (3) Upon the filing of the petition under paragraph (1) of this
    subsection, the court shall have jurisdiction to review the rule in
    accordance with chapter 7 of title 5 and to grant appropriate
    relief, including interim relief, as provided in such chapter. The
    court shall hold unlawful and set aside the rule on any ground
    specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), or (D) of section 706(2)
    of title 5 (taking due account of the rule of prejudicial error),
    or if - 
        (A) the court finds that the Commission's action is not
      supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record (as
      defined in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection) taken as a whole,
      or
        (B) the court finds that - 
          (i) a Commission determination under subsection (c) of this
        section that the petitioner is not entitled to conduct cross-
        examination or make rebuttal submissions, or
          (ii) a Commission rule or ruling under subsection (c) of this
        section limiting the petitioner's cross-examination or rebuttal
        submissions,

      has precluded disclosure of disputed material facts which was
      necessary for fair determination by the Commission of the
      rulemaking proceeding taken as a whole.

    The term "evidence", as used in this paragraph, means any matter in
    the rulemaking record.
      (4) The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in
    whole or in part, any such rule shall be final, subject to review
    by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or
    certification, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
      (5)(A) Remedies under the preceding paragraphs of this subsection
    are in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies provided
    by law.
      (B) The United States Courts of Appeal shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction of any action to obtain judicial review (other than in
    an enforcement proceeding) of a rule prescribed under subsection
    (a)(1)(B) of this section, if any district court of the United
    States would have had jurisdiction of such action but for this
    subparagraph. Any such action shall be brought in the United States
    Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, or for any
    circuit which includes a judicial district in which the action
    could have been brought but for this subparagraph.
      (C) A determination, rule, or ruling of the Commission described
    in paragraph (3)(B)(i) or (ii) may be reviewed only in a proceeding
    under this subsection and only in accordance with paragraph (3)(B).
    Section 706(2)(E) of title 5 shall not apply to any rule
    promulgated under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section. The
    contents and adequacy of any statement required by subsection
    (b)(1)(D) of this section shall not be subject to judicial review
    in any respect.
    (f) Unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks, savings and
      loan institutions, or Federal credit unions; promulgation of
      regulations by Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System,

      Administration Board; agency enforcement and compliance
      proceedings; violations; power of other Federal agencies
      unaffected; reporting requirements
      (1) In order to prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in
    or affecting commerce (including acts or practices which are unfair
    or deceptive to consumers) by banks or savings and loan
    institutions described in paragraph (3), each agency specified in
    paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection shall establish a separate
    division of consumer affairs which shall receive and take
    appropriate action upon complaints with respect to such acts or
    practices by banks or savings and loan institutions described in
    paragraph (3) subject to its jurisdiction. The Board of Governors
    of the Federal Reserve System (with respect to banks) and the
    Federal Home Loan Bank Board (with respect to savings and loan
    institutions described in paragraph (3)) and the National Credit
    Union Administration Board (with respect to Federal credit unions
    described in paragraph (4)) shall prescribe regulations to carry
    out the purposes of this section, including regulations defining
    with specificity such unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and
    containing requirements prescribed for the purpose of preventing
    such acts or practices. Whenever the Commission prescribes a rule
    under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, then within 60 days
    after such rule takes effect each such Board shall promulgate
    substantially similar regulations prohibiting acts or practices of
    banks or savings and loan institutions described in paragraph (3),
    or Federal credit unions described in paragraph (4), as the case
    may be, which are substantially similar to those prohibited by
    rules of the Commission and which impose substantially similar
    requirements, unless (A) any such Board finds that such acts or
    practices of banks or savings and loan institutions described in
    paragraph (3), or Federal credit unions described in paragraph (4),
    as the case may be, are not unfair or deceptive, or (B) the Board
    of Governors of the Federal Reserve System finds that
    implementation of similar regulations with respect to banks,
    savings and loan institutions or Federal credit unions would
    seriously conflict with essential monetary and payments systems
    policies of such Board, and publishes any such finding, and the
    reasons therefor, in the Federal Register.
      (2) Enforcement. - Compliance with regulations prescribed under
    this subsection shall be enforced under section 1818 of title 12,
    in the case of -

      foreign banks, by the division of consumer affairs established by
      the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency;
        (B) member banks of the Federal Reserve System (other than
      national banks), branches and agencies of foreign banks (other

      section 25 or 25(a) (!1) of the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C.
      601 et seq., 611 et seq.], by the division of consumer affairs
      established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
      System; and

    savings associations as defined in section 1813 of title 12.
      (4) Compliance with regulations prescribed under this subsection
    shall be enforced with respect to Federal credit unions under
    sections 1766 and 1786 of title 12.
      (5) For the purpose of the exercise by any agency referred to in
    paragraph (2) of its powers under any Act referred to in that
    paragraph, a violation of any regulation prescribed under this
    subsection shall be deemed to be a violation of a requirement
    imposed under that Act. In addition to its powers under any
    provision of law specifically referred to in paragraph (2), each of
    the agencies referred to in that paragraph may exercise, for the
    purpose of enforcing compliance with any regulation prescribed
    under this subsection, any other authority conferred on it by law.
      (6) The authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal
    Reserve System to issue regulations under this subsection does not
    impair the authority of any other agency designated in this
    subsection to make rules respecting its own procedures in enforcing
    compliance with regulations prescribed under this subsection.
      (7) Each agency exercising authority under this subsection shall
    transmit to the Congress each year a detailed report on its
    activities under this paragraph during the preceding calendar year.

    The terms used in this paragraph that are not defined in this
    subchapter or otherwise defined in section 1813(s) of title 12
    shall have the meaning given to them in section 3101 of title 12.
    (g) Exemptions and stays from application of rules; procedures
      (1) Any person to whom a rule under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this
    section applies may petition the Commission for an exemption from
    such rule.

    paragraph (1), the Commission finds that the application of a rule
    prescribed under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section to any person
    or class or (!3) persons is not necessary to prevent the unfair or
    deceptive act or practice to which the rule relates, the Commission
    may exempt such person or class from all or part of such rule.
    Section 553 of title 5 shall apply to action under this paragraph.

      (3) Neither the pendency of a proceeding under this subsection
    respecting an exemption from a rule, nor the pendency of judicial
    proceedings to review the Commission's action or failure to act
    under this subsection, shall stay the applicability of such rule
    under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.
    (h) Restriction on rulemaking authority of Commission respecting
      children's advertising proceedings pending on May 28, 1980
      The Commission shall not have any authority to promulgate any
    rule in the children's advertising proceeding pending on May 28,
    1980, or in any substantially similar proceeding on the basis of a
    determination by the Commission that such advertising constitutes
    an unfair act or practice in or affecting commerce.
    (i) Meetings with outside parties
      (1) For purposes of this subsection, the term "outside party"
    means any person other than (A) a Commissioner; (B) an officer or

        (A) notice of any such meeting shall be included in any weekly
      calendar prepared by the Commission; and

    Sec. 57b. Civil actions for violations of rules and cease and
      desist orders respecting unfair or deceptive acts or practices

-STATUTE-
    (a) Suits by Commission against persons, partnerships, or
      corporations; jurisdiction; relief for dishonest or fraudulent
      acts
      (1) If any person, partnership, or corporation violates any rule
    under this subchapter respecting unfair or deceptive acts or
    practices (other than an interpretive rule, or a rule violation of
    which the Commission has provided is not an unfair or deceptive act
    or practice in violation of section 45(a) of this title), then the
    Commission may commence a civil action against such person,
    partnership, or corporation for relief under subsection (b) of this
    section in a United States district court or in any court of
    competent jurisdiction of a State.
      (2) If any person, partnership, or corporation engages in any
    unfair or deceptive act or practice (within the meaning of section
    45(a)(1) of this title) with respect to which the Commission has
    issued a final cease and desist order which is applicable to such
    person, partnership, or corporation, then the Commission may
    commence a civil action against such person, partnership, or
    corporation in a United States district court or in any court of
    competent jurisdiction of a State. If the Commission satisfies the
    court that the act or practice to which the cease and desist order
    relates is one which a reasonable man would have known under the
    circumstances was dishonest or fraudulent, the court may grant
    relief under subsection (b) of this section.
    (b) Nature of relief available
      The court in an action under subsection (a) of this section shall
    have jurisdiction to grant such relief as the court finds necessary
    to redress injury to consumers or other persons, partnerships, and
    corporations resulting from the rule violation or the unfair or
    deceptive act or practice, as the case may be. Such relief may
    include, but shall not be limited to, rescission or reformation of
    contracts, the refund of money or return of property, the payment
    of damages, and public notification respecting the rule violation
    or the unfair or deceptive act or practice, as the case may be;
    except that nothing in this subsection is intended to authorize the
    imposition of any exemplary or punitive damages.
    (c) Conclusiveness of findings of Commission in cease and desist
      proceedings; notice of judicial proceedings to injured persons,
      etc.
      (1) If (A) a cease and desist order issued under section 45(b) of
    this title has become final under section 45(g) of this title with
    respect to any person's, partnership's, or corporation's rule
    violation or unfair or deceptive act or practice, and (B) an action
    under this section is brought with respect to such person's,
    partnership's, or corporation's rule violation or act or practice,
    then the findings of the Commission as to the material facts in the
    proceeding under section 45(b) of this title with respect to such
    person's, partnership's, or corporation's rule violation or act or
    practice, shall be conclusive unless (i) the terms of such cease
    and desist order expressly provide that the Commission's findings
    shall not be conclusive, or (ii) the order became final by reason
    of section 45(g)(1) of this title, in which case such finding shall
    be conclusive if supported by evidence.
      (2) The court shall cause notice of an action under this section
    to be given in a manner which is reasonably calculated, under all
    of the circumstances, to apprise the persons, partnerships, and
    corporations allegedly injured by the defendant's rule violation or
    act or practice of the pendency of such action. Such notice may, in
    the discretion of the court, be given by publication.
    (d) Time for bringing of actions
      No action may be brought by the Commission under this section
    more than 3 years after the rule violation to which an action under
    subsection (a)(1) of this section relates, or the unfair or
    deceptive act or practice to which an action under subsection
    (a)(2) of this section relates; except that if a cease and desist
    order with respect to any person's, partnership's, or corporation's
    rule violation or unfair or deceptive act or practice has become
    final and such order was issued in a proceeding under section 45(b)
    of this title which was commenced not later than 3 years after the
    rule violation or act or practice occurred, a civil action may be
    commenced under this section against such person, partnership, or
    corporation at any time before the expiration of one year after
    such order becomes final.
    (e) Availability of additional Federal or State remedies; other
      authority of Commission unaffected
      Remedies provided in this section are in addition to, and not in
    lieu of, any other remedy or right of action provided by State or
    Federal law. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect
    any authority of the Commission under any other provision of law.

    question, in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the

    changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make
    shall be entered and identified upon the transcript by the
    Commission investigator with a statement of the reasons given by
    the witness for making such changes. The transcript shall then be
    signed by the witness, unless the witness in writing waives the
    signing, is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign.
      (ii) If the transcript is not signed by the witness during the 30-
    day period following the date upon which the witness is first
    afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine it, the Commission
    investigator shall sign the transcript and state on the record the
    fact of the waiver, illness, absence of the witness, or the refusal
    to sign, together with any reasons given for the failure to sign.

    transcript of his testimony.
      (H) Any witness appearing for the taking of oral testimony

      Materials received as a result of a civil investigative demand

    this title.
    (e) Petition for enforcement
      Whenever any person fails to comply with any civil investigative
    demand duly served upon him under this section, or whenever
    satisfactory copying or reproduction of material requested pursuant
    to the demand cannot be accomplished and such person refuses to
    surrender such material, the Commission, through such officers or
    attorneys as it may designate, may file, in the district court of
    the United States for any judicial district in which such person
    resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon such
    person, a petition for an order of such court for the enforcement
    of this section. All process of any court to which application may
    be made as provided in this subsection may be served in any
    judicial district.
    (f) Petition for order modifying or setting aside demand
      (1) Not later than 20 days after the service of any civil
    investigative demand upon any person under subsection (c) of this
    section, or at any time before the return date specified in the
    demand, whichever period is shorter, or within such period
    exceeding 20 days after service or in excess of such return date as
    may be prescribed in writing, subsequent to service, by any
    Commission investigator named in the demand, such person may file
    with the Commission a petition for an order by the Commission
    modifying or setting aside the demand.
      (2) The time permitted for compliance with the demand in whole or
    in part, as deemed proper and ordered by the Commission, shall not
    run during the pendency of such petition at the Commission, except
    that such person shall comply with any portions of the demand not
    sought to be modified or set aside. Such petition shall specify
    each ground upon which the petitioner relies in seeking such
    relief, and may be based upon any failure of the demand to comply
    with the provisions of this section, or upon any constitutional or
    other legal right or privilege of such person.
    (g) Custodial control of documentary material, tangible things,
      reports, etc.
      At any time during which any custodian is in custody or control
    of any documentary material, tangible things, reports, answers to
    questions, or transcripts of oral testimony given by any person in
    compliance with any civil investigative demand, such person may
    file, in the district court of the United States for the judicial
    district within which the office of such custodian is situated, and
    serve upon such custodian, a petition for an order of such court
    requiring the performance by such custodian of any duty imposed
    upon him by this section or section 57b-2 of this title.
    (h) Jurisdiction of court
      Whenever any petition is filed in any district court of the
    United States under this section, such court shall have
    jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter so presented, and to
    enter such order or orders as may be required to carry into effect
    the provisions of this section. Any final order so entered shall be
    subject to appeal pursuant to section 1291 of title 28. Any
    disobedience of any final order entered under this section by any
    court shall be punished as a contempt of such court.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission shall
    have no authority to issue a subpoena or make a demand for
    information, under authority of this subchapter or any other
    provision of law, unless such subpoena or demand for information is
    signed by a Commissioner acting pursuant to a Commission
    resolution. The Commission shall not delegate the power conferred
    by this section to sign subpoenas or demands for information to any
    other person.
    (j) Applicability of this section
      The provisions of this section shall not -

    be required for official use by any duly authorized officer or
    employee of the Commission under regulations which shall be
    promulgated by the Commission. Notwithstanding subparagraph (C),
    such material, things, and transcripts may be used by any such
    officer or employee in connection with the taking of oral testimony
    under this section.
      (C) Except as otherwise provided in this section, while in the
    possession of the custodian, no documentary material, tangible
    things, reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral
    testimony shall be available for examination by any individual
    other than a duly authorized officer or employee of the Commission
    without the consent of the person who produced the material,
    things, or transcripts. Nothing in this section is intended to
    prevent disclosure to either House of the Congress or to any
    committee or subcommittee of the Congress, except that the
    Commission immediately shall notify the owner or provider of any
    such information of a request for information designated as
    confidential by the owner or provider.
      (D) While in the possession of the custodian and under such
    reasonable terms and conditions as the Commission shall prescribe -
    
        (i) documentary material, tangible things, or written reports
      shall be available for examination by the person who produced the
      material, or by any duly authorized representative of such
      person; and
        (ii) answers to questions in writing and transcripts of oral
      testimony shall be available for examination by the person who
      produced the testimony or by his attorney.

      (4) Whenever the Commission has instituted a proceeding against a
    person, partnership, or corporation, the custodian may deliver to
    any officer or employee of the Commission documentary material,
    tangible things, written reports or answers to questions, and
    transcripts of oral testimony for official use in connection with
    such proceeding. Upon the completion of the proceeding, the officer
    or employee shall return to the custodian any such material so
    delivered which has not been received into the record of the
    proceeding.
      (5) If any documentary material, tangible things, written reports
    or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony have
    been produced in the course of any investigation by any person
    pursuant to compulsory process and - 
        (A) any proceeding arising out of the investigation has been
      completed; or
        (B) no proceeding in which the material may be used has been
      commenced within a reasonable time after completion of the
      examination and analysis of all such material and other
      information assembled in the course of the investigation;

    then the custodian shall, upon written request of the person who
    produced the material, return to the person any such material which
    has not been received into the record of any such proceeding (other
    than copies of such material made by the custodian pursuant to
    paragraph (3)(B)).
      (6) The custodian of any documentary material, written reports or
    answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony may deliver
    to any officers or employees of appropriate Federal law enforcement
    agencies, in response to a written request, copies of such material
    for use in connection with an investigation or proceeding under the
    jurisdiction of any such agency. The custodian of any tangible
    things may make such things available for inspection to such
    persons on the same basis. Such materials shall not be made
    available to any such agency until the custodian received
    certification of any officer of such agency that such information
    will be maintained in confidence and will be used only for official
    law enforcement purposes. Such documentary material, results of
    inspections of tangible things, written reports or answers to
    questions, and transcripts of oral testimony may be used by any
    officer or employee of such agency only in such manner and subject
    to such conditions as apply to the Commission under this section.
    The custodian may make such materials available to any State law
    enforcement agency upon the prior certification of any officer of
    such agency that such information will be maintained in confidence
    and will be used only for official law enforcement purposes. The
    custodian may make such material available to any foreign law
    enforcement agency upon the prior certification of an appropriate
    official of any such foreign law enforcement agency, either by a
    prior agreement or memorandum of understanding with the Commission
    or by other written certification, that such material will be
    maintained in confidence and will be used only for official law
    enforcement purposes, if - 
        (A) the foreign law enforcement agency has set forth a bona
      fide legal basis for its authority to maintain the material in
      confidence;
        (B) the materials are to be used for purposes of investigating,
      or engaging in enforcement proceedings related to, possible
      violations of - 
          (i) foreign laws prohibiting fraudulent or deceptive
        commercial practices, or other practices substantially similar
        to practices prohibited by any law administered by the
        Commission;
          (ii) a law administered by the Commission, if disclosure of
        the material would further a Commission investigation or
        enforcement proceeding; or
          (iii) with the approval of the Attorney General, other
        foreign criminal laws, if such foreign criminal laws are
        offenses defined in or covered by a criminal mutual legal
        assistance treaty in force between the government of the United
        States and the foreign law enforcement agency's government;

        (C) the appropriate Federal banking agency (as defined in
      section 1813(q) of title 12) or, in the case of a Federal credit
      union, the National Credit Union Administration, has given its
      prior approval if the materials to be provided under subparagraph
      (B) are requested by the foreign law enforcement agency for the
      purpose of investigating, or engaging in enforcement proceedings
      based on, possible violations of law by a bank, a savings and
      loan institution described in section 57a(f)(3) of this title, or
      a Federal credit union described in section 57a(f)(4) of this
      title; and
        (D) the foreign law enforcement agency is not from a foreign
      state that the Secretary of State has determined, in accordance
      with section 2405(j) of the Appendix to title 50, has repeatedly
      provided support for acts of international terrorism, unless and
      until such determination is rescinded pursuant to section
      2405(j)(4) of the Appendix to title 50.

    Nothing in the preceding sentence authorizes the disclosure of
    material obtained in connection with the administration of the
    Federal antitrust laws or foreign antitrust laws (as defined in
    paragraphs (5) and (7), respectively, of section 6211 of this
    title) to any officer or employee of a foreign law enforcement
    agency.
      (7) In the event of the death, disability, or separation from
    service in the Commission of the custodian of any documentary
    material, tangible things, written reports or answers to questions,
    and transcripts of oral testimony produced under any demand issued
    under this subchapter, or the official relief of the custodian from
    responsibility for the custody and control of such material, the
    Commission promptly shall - 
        (A) designate under paragraph (2)(A) another duly authorized
      agent to serve as custodian of such material; and
        (B) transmit in writing to the person who produced the material
      or testimony notice as to the identity and address of the
      successor so designated.

    Any successor designated under paragraph (2)(A) as a result of the
    requirements of this paragraph shall have (with regard to the
    material involved) all duties and responsibilities imposed by this
    section upon his predecessor in office with regard to such
    material, except that he shall not be held responsible for any
    default or dereliction which occurred before his designation.
    (c) Information considered confidential
      (1) All information reported to or otherwise obtained by the
    Commission which is not subject to the requirements of subsection
    (b) of this section shall be considered confidential when so marked
    by the person supplying the information and shall not be disclosed,
    except in accordance with the procedures established in paragraph
    (2) and paragraph (3).
      (2) If the Commission determines that a document marked
    confidential by the person supplying it may be disclosed because it
    is not a trade secret or commercial or financial information which
    is obtained from any person and which is privileged or
    confidential, within the meaning of section 46(f) of this title,
    then the Commission shall notify such person in writing that the
    Commission intends to disclose the document at a date not less than
    10 days after the date of receipt of notification.
      (3) Any person receiving such notification may, if he believes
    disclosure of the document would cause disclosure of a trade
    secret, or commercial or financial information which is obtained
    from any person and which is privileged or confidential, within the
    meaning of section 46(f) of this title, before the date set for
    release of the document, bring an action in the district court of
    the United States for the district within which the documents are
    located or in the United States District Court for the District of
    Columbia to restrain disclosure of the document. Any person
    receiving such notification may file with the appropriate district
    court or court of appeals of the United States, as appropriate, an
    application for a stay of disclosure. The documents shall not be
    disclosed until the court has ruled on the application for a stay.
    (d) Particular disclosures allowed
      (1) The provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall not be
    construed to prohibit - 
        (A) the disclosure of information to either House of the
      Congress or to any committee or subcommittee of the Congress,
      except that the Commission immediately shall notify the owner or
      provider of any such information of a request for information
      designated as confidential by the owner or provider;
        (B) the disclosure of the results of any investigation or study
      carried out or prepared by the Commission, except that no
      information shall be identified nor shall information be
      disclosed in such a manner as to disclose a trade secret of any
      person supplying the trade secret, or to disclose any commercial
      or financial information which is obtained from any person and
      which is privileged or confidential;
        (C) the disclosure of relevant and material information in
      Commission adjudicative proceedings or in judicial proceedings to
      which the Commission is a party; or
        (D) the disclosure to a Federal agency of disaggregated
      information obtained in accordance with section 3512 (!1) of
      title 44, except that the recipient agency shall use such
      disaggregated information for economic, statistical, or
      policymaking purposes only, and shall not disclose such
      information in an individually identifiable form.

      (2) Any disclosure of relevant and material information in
    Commission adjudicative proceedings or in judicial proceedings to
    which the Commission is a party shall be governed by the rules of
    the Commission for adjudicative proceedings or by court rules or
    orders, except that the rules of the Commission shall not be
    amended in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this section.
    (e) Effect on other statutory provisions limiting disclosure
      Nothing in this section shall supersede any statutory provision
    which expressly prohibits or limits particular disclosures by the
    Commission, or which authorizes disclosures to any other Federal
    agency.
    (f) Exemption from public disclosure
      (1) In general
        Any material which is received by the Commission in any
      investigation, a purpose of which is to determine whether any
      person may have violated any provision of the laws administered
      by the Commission, and which is provided pursuant to any
      compulsory process under this subchapter or which is provided
      voluntarily in place of such compulsory process shall not be
      required to be disclosed under section 552 of title 5 or any
      other provision of law, except as provided in paragraph (2)(B) of
      this section.
      (2) Material obtained from a foreign source
        (A) In general
          Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the
        Commission shall not be required to disclose under section 552
        of title 5 or any other provision of law - 
            (i) any material obtained from a foreign law enforcement
          agency or other foreign government agency, if the foreign law
          enforcement agency or other foreign government agency has
          requested confidential treatment, or has precluded such
          disclosure under other use limitations, as a condition of
          providing the material;
            (ii) any material reflecting a consumer complaint obtained
          from any other foreign source, if that foreign source
          supplying the material has requested confidential treatment
          as a condition of providing the material; or
            (iii) any material reflecting a consumer complaint
          submitted to a Commission reporting mechanism sponsored in
          part by foreign law enforcement agencies or other foreign
          government agencies.
        (B) Savings provision
          Nothing in this subsection shall authorize the Commission to
        withhold information from the Congress or prevent the
        Commission from complying with an order of a court of the
        United States in an action commenced by the United States or
        the Commission.

    (a) Application with other laws
      The Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.) and
    chapter 121 of title 18 shall apply with respect to the Commission,
    except as otherwise provided in this section.
    (b) Procedures for delay of notification or prohibition of
      disclosure
      The procedures for delay of notification or prohibition of
    disclosure under the Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. 3401
    et seq.) and chapter 121 of title 18, including procedures for
    extensions of such delays or prohibitions, shall be available to
    the Commission, provided that, notwithstanding any provision
    therein - 
        (1) a court may issue an order delaying notification or
      prohibiting disclosure (including extending such an order) in
      accordance with the procedures of section 1109 of the Right to
      Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. 3409) (if notification would
      otherwise be required under that Act), or section 2705 of title
      18 (if notification would otherwise be required under chapter 121
      of that title), if the presiding judge or magistrate judge finds
      that there is reason to believe that such notification or
      disclosure may cause an adverse result as defined in subsection
      (g) of this section; and
        (2) if notification would otherwise be required under chapter
      121 of title 18, the Commission may delay notification (including
      extending such a delay) upon the execution of a written
      certification in accordance with the procedures of section 2705
      of that title if the Commission finds that there is reason to
      believe that notification may cause an adverse result as defined
      in subsection (g) of this section.
    (c) Ex parte application by Commission
      (1) In general
        If neither notification nor delayed notification by the
      Commission is required under the Right to Financial Privacy Act
      (12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.) or chapter 121 of title 18, the
      Commission may apply ex parte to a presiding judge or magistrate
      judge for an order prohibiting the recipient of compulsory
      process issued by the Commission from disclosing to any other
      person the existence of the process, notwithstanding any law or
      regulation of the United States, or under the constitution, or
      any law or regulation, of any State, political subdivision of a
      State, territory of the United States, or the District of
      Columbia. The presiding judge or magistrate judge may enter such
      an order granting the requested prohibition of disclosure for a
      period not to exceed 60 days if there is reason to believe that
      disclosure may cause an adverse result as defined in subsection
      (g). The presiding judge or magistrate judge may grant extensions
      of this order of up to 30 days each in accordance with this
      subsection, except that in no event shall the prohibition
      continue in force for more than a total of 9 months.
      (2) Application
        This subsection shall apply only in connection with compulsory
      process issued by the Commission where the recipient of such
      process is not a subject of the investigation or proceeding at
      the time such process is issued.
      (3) Limitation
        No order issued under this subsection shall prohibit any
      recipient from disclosing to a Federal agency that the recipient
      has received compulsory process from the Commission.
    (d) No liability for failure to notify
      If neither notification nor delayed notification by the
    Commission is required under the Right to Financial Privacy Act (12
    U.S.C. 3401 et seq.) or chapter 121 of title 18, the recipient of
    compulsory process issued by the Commission under this subchapter
    shall not be liable under any law or regulation of the United
    States, or under the constitution, or any law or regulation, of any
    State, political subdivision of a State, territory of the United
    States, or the District of Columbia, or under any contract or other
    legally enforceable agreement, for failure to provide notice to any
    person that such process has been issued or that the recipient has
    provided information in response to such process. The preceding
    sentence does not exempt any recipient from liability for - 
        (1) the underlying conduct reported;
        (2) a failure to comply with the record retention requirements
      under section 1104(c) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act (12
      U.S.C. 3404[c]), where applicable; or
        (3) any failure to comply with any obligation the recipient may
      have to disclose to a Federal agency that the recipient has
      received compulsory process from the Commission or intends to
      provide or has provided information to the Commission in response
      to such process.

        All judicial proceedings initiated by the Commission under the
      Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.), chapter
      121 of title 18, or this section may be brought in the United
      States District Court for the District of Columbia or any other
      appropriate United States District Court. All ex parte

      pursuant to this section shall be held in camera and the records
      thereof sealed until expiration of the period of delay or such
      other date as the presiding judge or magistrate judge may permit.

      This section shall not apply to an investigation or proceeding

    Sec. 57b-3. Rulemaking process

-STATUTE-
    (a) Definitions
      For purposes of this section:
        (1) The term "rule" means any rule promulgated by the
      Commission under section 46 or section 57a of this title, except
      that such term does not include interpretive rules, rules
      involving Commission management or personnel, general statements
      of policy, or rules relating to Commission organization,
      procedure, or practice. Such term does not include any amendment
      to a rule unless the Commission - 
          (A) estimates that such amendment will have an annual effect
        on the national economy of $100,000,000 or more;
          (B) estimates that such amendment will cause a substantial
        change in the cost or price of goods or services which are used
        extensively by particular industries, which are supplied
        extensively in particular geographic regions, or which are
        acquired in significant quantities by the Federal Government,
        or by State or local governments; or
          (C) otherwise determines that such amendment will have a
        significant impact upon persons subject to regulation under
        such amendment and upon consumers.

        (2) The term "rulemaking" means any Commission process for
      formulating or amending a rule.
    (b) Notice of proposed rulemaking; regulatory analysis; contents;
      issuance
      (1) In any case in which the Commission publishes notice of a
    proposed rulemaking, the Commission shall issue a preliminary
    regulatory analysis relating to the proposed rule involved. Each
    preliminary regulatory analysis shall contain - 
        (A) a concise statement of the need for, and the objectives of,
      the proposed rule;
        (B) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the
      proposed rule which may accomplish the stated objective of the
      rule in a manner consistent with applicable law; and
        (C) for the proposed rule, and for each of the alternatives
      described in the analysis, a preliminary analysis of the
      projected benefits and any adverse economic effects and any other
      effects, and of the effectiveness of the proposed rule and each
      alternative in meeting the stated objectives of the proposed
      rule.

      (2) In any case in which the Commission promulgates a final rule,
    the Commission shall issue a final regulatory analysis relating to
    the final rule. Each final regulatory analysis shall contain - 
        (A) a concise statement of the need for, and the objectives of,
      the final rule;
        (B) a description of any alternatives to the final rule which
      were considered by the Commission;
        (C) an analysis of the projected benefits and any adverse
      economic effects and any other effects of the final rule;
        (D) an explanation of the reasons for the determination of the
      Commission that the final rule will attain its objectives in a
      manner consistent with applicable law and the reasons the
      particular alternative was chosen; and
        (E) a summary of any significant issues raised by the comments
      submitted during the public comment period in response to the
      preliminary regulatory analysis, and a summary of the assessment
      by the Commission of such issues.

      (3)(A) In order to avoid duplication or waste, the Commission is
    authorized to - 
        (i) consider a series of closely related rules as one rule for
      purposes of this subsection; and
        (ii) whenever appropriate, incorporate any data or analysis
      contained in a regulatory analysis issued under this subsection
      in the statement of basis and purpose to accompany any rule
      promulgated under section 57a(a)(1)(B) of this title, and
      incorporate by reference in any preliminary or final regulatory
      analysis information contained in a notice of proposed rulemaking
      or a statement of basis and purpose.

      (B) The Commission shall include, in each notice of proposed
    rulemaking and in each publication of a final rule, a statement of
    the manner in which the public may obtain copies of the preliminary
    and final regulatory analyses. The Commission may charge a
    reasonable fee for the copying and mailing of regulatory analyses.
    The regulatory analyses shall be furnished without charge or at a
    reduced charge if the Commission determines that waiver or
    reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing
    the information primarily benefits the general public.
      (4) The Commission is authorized to delay the completion of any
    of the requirements established in this subsection by publishing in
    the Federal Register, not later than the date of publication of the
    final rule involved, a finding that the final rule is being
    promulgated in response to an emergency which makes timely
    compliance with the provisions of this subsection impracticable.
    Such publication shall include a statement of the reasons for such
    finding.
      (5) The requirements of this subsection shall not be construed to
    alter in any manner the substantive standards applicable to any
    action by the Commission, or the procedural standards otherwise
    applicable to such action.
    (c) Judicial review
      (1) The contents and adequacy of any regulatory analysis prepared
    or issued by the Commission under this section, including the
    adequacy of any procedure involved in such preparation or issuance,
    shall not be subject to any judicial review in any court, except
    that a court, upon review of a rule pursuant to section 57a(e) of
    this title, may set aside such rule if the Commission has failed
    entirely to prepare a regulatory analysis.
      (2) Except as specified in paragraph (1), no Commission action
    may be invalidated, remanded, or otherwise affected by any court on
    account of any failure to comply with the requirements of this
    section.
      (3) The provisions of this subsection do not alter the
    substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to
    judicial review of any action by the Commission.
    (d) Regulatory agenda; contents; publication dates in Federal
      Register
      (1) The Commission shall publish at least semiannually a
    regulatory agenda. Each regulatory agenda shall contain a list of
    rules which the Commission intends to propose or promulgate during
    the 12-month period following the publication of the agenda. On the
    first Monday in October of each year, the Commission shall publish
    in the Federal Register a schedule showing the dates during the
    current fiscal year on which the semiannual regulatory agenda of
    the Commission will be published.
      (2) For each rule listed in a regulatory agenda, the Commission
    shall - 
        (A) describe the rule;
        (B) state the objectives of and the legal basis for the rule;
      and
        (C) specify any dates established or anticipated by the
      Commission for taking action, including dates for advance notice
      of proposed rulemaking, notices of proposed rulemaking, and final
      action by the Commission.

      (3) Each regulatory agenda shall state the name, office address,
    and office telephone number of the Commission officer or employee
    responsible for responding to any inquiry relating to each rule
    listed.
      (4) The Commission shall not propose or promulgate a rule which
    was not listed on a regulatory agenda unless the Commission
    publishes with the rule an explanation of the reasons the rule was
    omitted from such agenda.

    Sec. 65. Information required from export trade corporation; powers
      of Federal Trade Commission

-STATUTE-
      Every association which engages solely in export trade, within
    thirty days after its creation, shall file with the Federal Trade
    Commission a verified written statement setting forth the location
    of its offices or places of business and the names and addresses of
    all its officers and of all its stockholders or members, and if a
    corporation, a copy of its certificate or articles of incorporation
    and bylaws, and if unincorporated, a copy of its articles or
    contract of association, and on the 1st day of January of each year
    every association engaged solely in export trade shall make a like
    statement of the location of its offices or places of business and
    the names and addresses of all its officers and of all its
    stockholders or members and of all amendments to and changes in its
    articles or certificate of incorporation or in its articles or
    contract of association. It shall also furnish to the Commission
    such information as the Commission may require as to its
    organization business, conduct, practices, management, and relation
    to other associations, corporations, partnerships, and individuals.
    Any association which shall fail so to do shall not have the
    benefit of the provisions of sections 62 and 63 of this title, and
    it shall also forfeit to the United States the sum of $100 for each
    and every day of the continuance of such failure, which forfeiture
    shall be payable into the Treasury of the United States, and shall
    be recoverable in a civil suit in the name of the United States
    brought in the district where the association has its principal
    office, or in any district in which it shall do business. It shall
    be the duty of the various United States attorneys, under the
    direction of the Attorney General of the United States, to
    prosecute for the recovery of the forfeiture. The costs and
    expenses of such prosecution shall be paid out of the appropriation
    for the expenses of the courts of the United States.
      Whenever the Federal Trade Commission shall have reason to
    believe that an association or any agreement made or act done by
    such association is in restraint of trade within the United States
    or in restraint of the export trade of any domestic competitor of
    such association, or that an association either in the United
    States or elsewhere has entered into any agreement, understanding,
    or conspiracy, or done any act which artificially or intentionally
    enhances or depresses prices within the United States of
    commodities of the class exported by such association, or which
    substantially lessens competition within the United States or
    otherwise restrains trade therein, it shall summon such
    association, its officers, and agents to appear before it, and
    thereafter conduct an investigation into the alleged violations of
    law. Upon investigation, if it shall conclude that the law has been
    violated, it may make to such association recommendations for the
    readjustment of its business, in order that it may thereafter
    maintain its organization and management and conduct its business
    in accordance with law. If such association fails to comply with
    the recommendations of the Federal Trade Commission, said
    Commission shall refer its findings and recommendations to the
    Attorney General of the United States for such action thereon as he
    may deem proper.
      For the purpose of enforcing these provisions the Federal Trade
    Commission shall have all the powers, so far as applicable, given

    stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification, or substitute
    therefor under section 68c of this title, does not contain the
    information required by this subchapter, he may replace same with a
    substitute containing the information so required.
    (d) Designations on linings, paddings, etc.
      This section shall not be construed as requiring designation on
    garments or articles of apparel of fiber content of any linings,
    paddings, stiffening, trimmings, or facings, except those
    concerning which express or implied representations of fiber
    content are customarily made, nor as requiring designation of fiber
    content of products which have an insignificant or inconsequential
    textile content: Provided, That if any such article or product
    purports to contain or in any manner is represented as containing
    wool, this section shall be applicable thereto and the information
    required shall be separately set forth and segregated.
      The Commission, after giving due notice and opportunity to be
    heard to interested persons, may determine and publicly announce
    the classes of such articles concerning which express or implied
    representations of fiber content are customarily made, and those
    products which have an insignificant or inconsequential textile
    content.
    (e) False or deceptive advertising in mail order promotions
      For the purposes of this subchapter, a wool product shall be
    considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised in any mail
    order promotional material which is used in the direct sale or
    direct offering for sale of such wool product, unless such wool
    product description states in a clear and conspicuous manner that
    such wool product is processed or manufactured in the United States
    of America, or imported, or both.
    (f) Location of label, etc.
      For purposes of this subchapter, any wool product shall be
    misbranded if a stamp, tag, label, or other identification
    conforming to the requirements of this section is not on or affixed
    to the inside center of the neck midway between the shoulder seams
    or, if such product does not contain a neck, in the most
    conspicuous place on the inner side of such product, unless it is
    on or affixed on the outer side of such product or in the case of
    hosiery items, on the outer side of such product or package.

    subchapter, and the same, or substitutes therefor containing
    identical information with respect to content of the wool product
    or any other products contained therein in an amount of 5 per
    centum or more by weight and other information required under

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority of Commission
      Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, this subchapter
    shall be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission under rules,
    regulations, and procedure provided for in the Federal Trade
    Commission Act.
      The Commission is authorized and directed to prevent any person
    from violating the provisions of this subchapter in the same
    manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers,
    and duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the
    Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made a part
    of this subchapter; and any such person violating the provisions of
    this subchapter shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to
    the privileges and immunities provided in said Federal Trade
    Commission Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with the
    same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though the applicable
    terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were
    incorporated into and made a part of this subchapter.
      The Commission is authorized and directed to make rules and
    regulations for the manner and form of disclosing information
    required by this subchapter, and for segregation of such
    information for different portions of a wool product as may be
    necessary to avoid deception or confusion, and to make such further
    rules and regulations under and in pursuance of the terms of this
    subchapter as may be necessary and proper for administration and
    enforcement.
      The Commission is also authorized to cause inspections, analyses,
    tests, and examinations to be made of any wool products subject to
    this subchapter; and to cooperate with any department or agency of
    the Government, with any State, Territory, or possession, or with
    the District of Columbia; or with any department, agency, or
    political subdivision thereof; or with any person.
    (b) Maintenance of records by wool manufacturers
      Every manufacturer of wool products shall maintain proper records
    showing the fiber content as required by this subchapter of all
    wool products made by him, and shall preserve such records for at
    least three years.
      The neglect or refusal to maintain and so preserve such records
    is unlawful, and any such manufacturer who neglects or refuses to
    maintain and so preserve such records shall forfeit to the United
    States the sum of $100 for each day of such failure, which shall
    accrue to the United States and be recoverable in a civil action.

    Sec. 68e. Condemnation and injunction proceedings

-STATUTE-
    (a) Grounds for condemnation; disposition of merchandise
      Any wool products shall be liable to be proceeded against in the
    district court of the United States for the district in which
    found, and to be seized for confiscation by process of libel for
    condemnation, if the Commission has reasonable cause to believe
    such wool products are being manufactured or held for shipment, or
    shipped, or held for sale or exchange after shipment, in commerce
    in violation of the provisions of this subchapter, and if after
    notice from the Commission the provisions of this subchapter with
    respect to said products are not shown to be complied with.
    Proceedings in such libel cases shall conform as nearly as may be
    to suits in rem in admiralty, and may be brought by the Commission.
      If such wool products are condemned by the court, they shall be
    disposed of, in the discretion of the court, by destruction; by
    sale; by delivery to the owner or claimant thereof upon payment of
    legal costs and charges and upon execution of good and sufficient
    bond to the effect that such wool products will not be disposed of
    until properly stamped, tagged, labeled, or otherwise identified
    under the provisions of this subchapter; or by such charitable
    disposition as the court may deem proper. If such wool products are
    disposed of by sale, the proceeds, less legal costs and charges,
    shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States.
    (b) Grounds for temporary injunction or restraining order; issuance
      without bond
      Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that - 
        (1) Any person is violating, or is about to violate, sections
      68a, 68c, 68f, or 68g of this title, and that
        (2) It would be to the public interest to enjoin such violation
      until complaint is issued by the Commission under the Federal
      Trade Commission Act and such complaint dismissed by the
      Commission or set aside by the court on review, or until order to
      cease and desist made thereon by the Commission has become final
      within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act,

    the Commission may bring suit in the district court of the United
    States or in the United States court of any Territory, for the
    district or Territory in which such person resides or transacts
    business, to enjoin such violation, and upon proper showing a
    temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without
    bond.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 69g. Condemnation and injunction proceedings

-STATUTE-
    (a) Grounds for condemnation; disposition of merchandise
      (1) Any fur product or fur shall be liable to be proceeded
    against in the district court of the United States for the district
    in which found, and to be seized for confiscation by process of
    libel for condemnation, if the Commission has reasonable cause to
    believe such fur product or fur is being manufactured or held for
    shipment, or shipped, or held for sale or exchange after shipment,
    in commerce, in violation of the provisions of this subchapter, and
    if after notice from the Commission the provisions of this
    subchapter with respect to such fur product or fur are not shown to
    be complied with. Proceedings in such libel cases shall conform as
    nearly as may be to suits in rem in admiralty, and may be brought
    by the Commission.
      (2) If such fur products or furs are condemned by the court, they
    shall be disposed of, in the discretion of the court, by
    destruction, by sale, by delivery to the owner or claimant thereof
    upon payment of legal costs and charges and upon execution of good
    and sufficient bond to the effect that such fur or fur products
    will not be disposed of until properly marked, advertised, and
    invoiced as required under the provisions of this subchapter; or by
    such charitable disposition as the court may deem proper. If such
    furs or fur products are disposed of by sale, the proceeds, less
    legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the Treasury of the
    United States as miscellaneous receipts.
    (b) Grounds for temporary injunction or restraining order; issuance
      without bond
      Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that - 
        (1) any person is volating,(!1) or is about to violate, section
      69a, 69d, or 69h(b) of this title; and

        (2) it would be to the public interest to enjoin such violation
      until complaint is issued by the Commission under the Federal
      Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] and such complaint
      dismissed by the Commission or set aside by the court on review,
      or until order to cease and desist made thereon by the Commission
      has become final within the meaning of said Act,

    the Commission may bring suit in the district court of the United
    States or in the United States court of any Territory, for the
    district or Territory in which such person resides or transacts
    business, to enjoin such violation, and upon proper showing a
    temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without
    bond.

    Sec. 69h. Guaranty

-STATUTE-
    (a) Avoidance of liability; requirements
      No person shall be guilty under section 69a of this title if he
    establishes a guaranty received in good faith signed by and
    containing the name and address of the person residing in the
    United States by whom the fur product or fur guaranteed was
    manufactured or from whom it was received, that said fur product is
    not misbranded or that said fur product or fur is not falsely
    advertised or invoiced under the provisions of this subchapter.
    Such guaranty shall be either (1) a separate guaranty specifically
    designating the fur product or fur guaranteed, in which case it may
    be on the invoice or other paper relating to such fur product or
    fur; or (2) a continuing guaranty filed with the Commission
    applicable to any fur product or fur handled by a guarantor, in
    such form as the Commission by rules and regulations may prescribe.
    (b) Furnishing false guaranty
      It shall be unlawful for any person to furnish, with respect to
    any fur product or fur, a false guaranty (except a person relying
    upon a guaranty to the same effect received in good faith signed by
    and containing the name and address of the person residing in the
    United States by whom the fur product or fur guaranteed was
    manufactured or from whom it was received) with reason to believe
    the fur product or fur falsely guaranteed may be introduced, sold,
    transported, or distributed in commerce, and any person who
    violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of an unfair
    method of competition, and an unfair or deceptive act or practice,

        (1) The constituent fiber or combination of fibers in the
      textile fiber product, designating with equal prominence each
      natural or manufactured fiber in the textile fiber product by its

      shall be construed as prohibiting the disclosure of any fiber
      present in a textile fiber product which has a clearly
      established and definite functional significance where present in
      the amount stated: Provided further, That in the case of a
      textile fiber product which contains more than one kind of fiber,
      deviation in the fiber content of any fiber in such product, from
      the amount stated on the stamp, tag, label, or other
      identification shall not be a misbranding under this section
      unless such deviation is in excess of reasonable tolerances which
      shall be established by the Commission: And provided further,
      That any such deviation which exceeds said tolerances shall not
      be a misbranding if the person charged proves that the deviation
      resulted from unavoidable variations in manufacture and despite
      due care to make accurate the statements on the tag, stamp,
      label, or other identification.
        (3) The name, or other identification issued and registered by
      the Commission, of the manufacturer of the product or one or more

      in the United States, it be so identified.
    (c) False or deceptive advertisement
      For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product
    shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised if any
    disclosure or implication of fiber content is made in any written
    advertisement which is used to aid, promote, or assist directly or
    indirectly in the sale or offering for sale of such textile fiber
    product, unless the same information as that required to be shown
    on the stamp, tag, label, or other identification under subsection
    (b)(1) and (2) of this section is contained in the heading, body,
    or other part of such written advertisement, except that the
    percentages of the fiber present in the textile fiber product need
    not be stated.
    (d) Additional information allowed
      In addition to the information required in this section, the
    stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification, or
    advertisement may contain other information not violating the

       For purposes of this subchapter, in addition to the textile
    fiber products contained therein, a package of textile fiber
    products intended for sale to the ultimate consumer shall be
    misbranded unless such package has affixed to it a stamp, tag,
    label, or other means of identification bearing the information
    required by subsection (b) of this section, with respect to such
    contained textile fiber products, or is transparent to the extent
    it allows for the clear reading of the stamp, tag, label, or other
    means of identification on the textile fiber product, or in the
    case of hosiery items, this section shall not be construed as
    requiring the affixing of a stamp, tag, label, or other means of
    identification to each hosiery product contained in a package if
    (1) such hosiery products are intended for sale to the ultimate
    consumer in such package, (2) such package has affixed to it a
    stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification bearing, with
    respect to the hosiery products contained therein, the information
    required by subsection (b) of this section, and (3) the information

    to such package is equally applicable with respect to each textile
    fiber product contained therein.
    (f) Fabric severed from bolts, pieces or rolls of fabric
      This section shall not be construed as requiring designation of
    the fiber content of any portion of fabric, when sold at retail,
    which is severed from bolts, pieces, or rolls of fabric labeled in
    accordance with the provisions of this section at the time of such
    sale: Provided, That if any portion of fabric severed from a bolt,
    piece, or roll of fabric is in any manner represented as containing
    percentages of natural or manufactured fibers, other than that
    which is set forth on the labeled bolt, piece, or roll, this
    section shall be applicable thereto, and the information required

      For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product
    shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised if the
    name or symbol of any fur-bearing animal is used in the
    advertisement of such product unless such product, or the part
    thereof in connection with which the name or symbol of a fur-
    bearing animal is used, is a fur or fur product within the meaning
    of the Fur Products Labeling Act [15 U.S.C. 69 et seq.]: Provided,
    however, That where a textile fiber product contains the hair or
    fiber of a fur-bearing animal, the name of such animal, in
    conjunction with the word "fiber", "hair", or "blend", may be used.
    (h) Reused stuffing
      For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product
    shall be misbranded if it is used as stuffing in any upholstered
    product, mattress, or cushion after having been previously used as
    stuffing in any other upholstered product, mattress, or cushion,
    unless the upholstered product, mattress, or cushion containing
    such textile fiber product bears a stamp, tag, or label approved by
    the Commission indicating in words plainly legible that it contains
    reused stuffing.
    (i) Mail order catalog or promotional material
      For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product
    shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised in any
    mail order catalog or mail order promotional material which is used
    in the direct sale or direct offering for sale of such textile
    fiber product, unless such textile fiber product description states
    in a clear and conspicuous manner that such textile fiber product
    is processed or manufactured in the United States of America, or
    imported, or both.
    (j) Location of stamp, tag, label, or other identification
      For purposes of this subchapter, any textile fiber product shall
    be misbranded if a stamp, tag, label, or other identification
    conforming to the requirements of this section is not on or affixed
    to the inside center of the neck midway between the shoulder seams
    or, if such product does not contain a neck, in the most
    conspicuous place on the inner side of such product, unless it is
    on or affixed on the outer side of such product, or in the case of
    hosiery items on the outer side of such product or package.

    this title if he establishes a guaranty received in good faith,
    signed by and containing the name and address of the person
    residing in the United States by whom the textile fiber product
    guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received, that said
    product is not misbranded or falsely invoiced under the provisions
    of this subchapter. Said guaranty shall be (1) a separate guaranty
    specifically designating the textile fiber product guaranteed, in
    which case it may be on the invoice or other paper relating to said
    product; or (2) a continuing guaranty given by seller to the buyer

    furnishing such false guaranty relies on a guaranty to the same
    effect received in good faith signed by and containing the name and
    address of the person residing in the United States by whom the
    product guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received,
    is unlawful, and shall be an unfair method of competition, and an
    unfair and deceptive act or practice, in commerce, within the
    meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.].
