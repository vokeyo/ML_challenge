<P><B>ABSTRACT</B></P>

<P>Soil moisture plays a major role in regulating the energy balance at the
land surface and the growth of plants. Research is ongoing to develop new
procedures to monitor soil moisture across large regions of the country. A
promising tool appears to be passive microwave sensors on airborne or space
platforms. Passive microwave instruments, however, are affected by the
vegetation on the land surface, which acts to degrade the accuracy of the soil
moisture estimates. To further explore the use of passive microwave sensors to
monitor soil moisture, a large multi-disciplinary research program was
conducted in the Southern Great Plains region of Oklahoma in the summer of
1997. Included in the land surface monitoring were extensive measurements of
the vegetation in grass/pasture and wheat fields located in the Little Washita
watershed near Chickasha, at the Agricultural Research Service facility near El
Reno, and at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement /Cloud and Radiation Testbed
(ARM/CART) Central Facility near Lamont, Oklahoma. This report presents these
vegetative measurements and an analysis of the differences between the three
sampling areas and the vegetative types. Green and brown standing biomass and
surface residue biomass were sampled in a total of 48 fields, including one
corn field. From these biomass samples the water content of the aboveground
biomass was determined. Leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed
photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and plant height were also
measured. The greatest differences were observed between different vegetative
covers. Green biomass was greatest in the grass/pasture fields, while brown
biomass and surface residue were greatest in the harvested wheat fields. The
most water was found in the grass/pasture canopies, with the majority of water
located in the green standing biomass. Vegetation in the Central Facility and
Little Washita sampling areas was very similar. Most of the grass fields in the
El Reno sampling area were ungrazed and had significantly greater biomass, LAI,
and fAPAR than the grass fields in the other two sampling areas. These data
represent a snapshot of the vegetation conditions during the 24 June - 5 July
1997 period.  </P>

<P>This document describes the vegetation sampling procedures and the
vegetation data collected as part of the Southern Great Plains (SGP) 1997
Hydrological Experiment conducted in central Oklahoma from 18 June - 18 July
1997. The major objectives of the SGP 1997 Hydrological Experiment were to
measure soil moisture using the L-band Electronically Scanned Thinned Array
Radiometer (ESTAR), to evaluate the influence of soil moisture on the local
surface energy budget, and to evaluate the influence of the mesoscale
variability of the surface energy budget on the development of the convective
boundary layer. The ESTAR, a passive microwave radiometer with an operation
frequency of 1.4 gigahertz (GHz), was flown on an aircraft. Satellite data from
the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)
were also acquired to produce a 30 meter (m) vegetation classification and a 30
m vegetation parameter database.</P>

<B><A NAME="Meth">METHODS</A>
</B>

<P>Vegetation sampling was concentrated in three sampling areas in central
Oklahoma, the Little Washita watershed (LW) southwest of Chickasha, Oklahoma;
at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research
Center (ER) near El Reno, Oklahoma, just west of Oklahoma City; and at the
Atmospheric Radiation Measurement /Cloud and Radiation Testbed (ARM/CART)
Central Facility (CF) near Lamont, Oklahoma. Vegetation sampling included
measurements of green standing biomass, brown standing biomass, surface residue
biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and plant height. Four independent
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) flux density measurements--two above
the plant canopy and two below the canopy--were made at each sampling location.
From these field samples, water content, fraction absorbed PAR (fAPAR), green
and brown LAI, and specific foliage area (SFA) were derived to further describe
the surface vegetation. This section describes the field sampling protocol and
procedures used to compute the derived variables.</P>

<B><P><A NAME="M1">Vegetation Sampling Scheme</A></P>
</B>
<P>A detailed project description and sampling plan can be found in <A
HREF="#Jack97b">Jackson (1997b).</A> The sampling scheme proposed in Table 1
was designed to collect samples from prairie/pasture (80%), wheat (10%), and
other crops (10%). The initial scheme split prairie and pasture. However,
during the sampling process, this separation was not clear so the prairie and
pasture classifications were combined into a single class called grass/pasture.
Samples were collected from a total of 48 fields, including one corn (<I>Zea
mays</I> L.) field. Approximately 59 percent of the fields were grass/pasture,
35 percent wheat, and 6 percent other crops. The corn field and a Bermuda grass
field harvested for hay (LW14) were the two other crops sampled.</P>

<P>Vegetation samples were collected from the fields used for gravimetric and
profile soil moisture measurements. A single sample of ripe, unharvested wheat
was taken from ER15 near the edge of the unharvested wheat to minimize
disturbance to the standing crop. Fields with mixed vegetation included LW01
and CF06. Vegetation sampling crews were trained in LW01 which included short
Bermuda grass and wheat stubble. The CF06 site was a partially tilled, </P>

<P>harvested wheat field. Two samples were taken from the harvested but
untilled portion of the field and one residue estimate was taken from the
tilled area of the field.</P>

<P>Vegetation measurements were taken during the period from 24 June-5 July.
From 5-10&nbsp;July, the drying samples were measured daily until all the
samples were dry as determined by no further reduction in mass.</P> <B> <P><A
NAME="M2">Vegetation Sampling Procedures</A> </B> <P>Each field was sampled at
three different locations. Two sub-samples were collected at each sample
location, resulting in six green standing biomass, six brown standing biomass,
and six surface residue biomass measurements from each field. The leaf area
index (LAI) and the components of fAPAR were measured at five locations for
each sub-sample (one in the sampling frame and four within 3 m of the frame)
resulting in 30 LAI and fAPAR measurements for each field. In addition,
vertical and oblique photographs were taken of each sample location. Latitude
and longitude were recorded as well as the general weather conditions at the
time of sampling. Coordinates for the nearest meteorological station were also
recorded. The meteorological stations were operated by either the Oklahoma
Mesonet, the ARM/CART program, or the Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
Micronet program. A summary of the procedures used to collect the different
vegetation variables is presented below.</P>

<P>Sampling locations were approximately 100 m apart at a minimum of 100 m from
the field edges. Once the sample location was identified, a three-sided square
metal frame (0.71 m on a side) was pushed through the vegetation at the soil
surface. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (PLGR+, Rockwell
International) provided latitude and longitude with an accuracy of 3 to 5 m.
The second sub-sample was located within 5 m of the first sub-sample.</P>

<P>Descriptions of the vegetation type, growth stage, and conditions of
the sky, vegetation, and soil during the sampling time were recorded on
the data form (Figure 1). An oblique photograph centered on the sampling
frame was taken from a distance of 3 to 5 m. A vertical photograph
centered on the sampling frame was taken by holding the camera at
shoulder height with the lens facing the surface. The roll and frame
number of each picture were recorded on the data form. </P>

<P>Leaf area index (LAI) was measured in the sample frame with a plant canopy
analyzer (LAI-2000, LiCor, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska). A reading above the canopy
was followed by five readings below the canopy as described by <A
HREF="#Welles91">Welles and Norman (1991).</A> During the measurements the
canopy and LAI-2000 were shaded from the direct sun using a large umbrella.
This procedure was repeated at four locations around the sampling frame, within
3 m of the </P>

<P>frame. The LAI-2000 actually measures the <FONT FACE="WP
TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>foliage area index<FONT FACE="WP
TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> and cannot distinguish between leaves, stems, and
other structures that block incoming radiation. Leaves were predominate in the
grass fields, thus it was assumed that the LAI-2000 was measuring the LAI.
Standing wheat stubble with few or no leaves present dominated the the
harvested wheat fields. In this case it was assumed that the LAI-2000 was
measuring the foliage area index. This report refers to all LAI-2000
measurements as LAI.</P>

<P>A Sunceptometer (Decagon Devices, Pullman, Washington), an AccuPAR (Decagon
Devices, Pullman, Washington), and a Line Quantum Sensor (LI-191, LiCOR Inc.,
Lincoln, Nebraska) were used to measure PAR flux densities. Although each
sampling team used a different instrument, the errors introduced by the
instruments should be small <A HREF="#Acock94">(Acock et al., 1994)</A>. Care
was taken to level the instrument before each reading. Incoming
photosynthetically active radiation (S) was measured above the canopy with the
instrument level and facing upward. The PAR transmitted (T<SUB>C</SUB>) through
the vegetation canopy was measured  near the soil surface with the sensor level
and facing upward. The PAR reflected from the canopy (R<SUB>C</SUB>) was
measured with the instrument facing  downward at 1 m above the vegetation. The
PAR reflected by the soil (R<SUB>S</SUB>) was estimated as the product of bare
soil reflectance (R<SUB>BS</SUB>) from tilled wheat fields and T<SUB>C</SUB> <A
HREF="#Dau">(Daughtry et al., 1992).</A> </P>

<P>Vegetation height was measured at five spots within the sampling
frame and recorded on the data form. After the various measurements of
the canopy within and around the sampling frame were completed, a
meter stick was used to form the fourth side of the sampling frame,
and the standing vegetation was clipped at the soil surface. All
vegetation within the volume defined by the sampling frame was clipped
and collected. If a plant extended from outside the frame into the
frame volume, or from inside the frame to outside, only the part of
the plant within the frame volume was clipped and included in the
sample. All clipped vegetation was then separated into either green or
brown vegetation that was bagged and weighed separately. The
vegetative surface residue was collected from the soil surface and
placed in a separate bag and weighed.</P>

<P>The collected samples were weighed in an area sheltered from the wind as
soon as the team exited the field. From the time that the first sample was
collected until it was weighed was approximately 90 minutes. At the end of each
day, the samples were placed in a forced-air dryer at approximately 50<FONT
FACE="WP MathA">E</FONT>C until dry. After four days, several representative
bags were weighed, allowed to dry for another day, and re-weighed. This
procedure was repeated daily until there was no further decrease in mass.</P>

<B><A NAME="M3"><P>Tilled Wheat Field Sampling</A>
</B>
<P>Vegetation samples were not taken from harvested wheat fields that
had been tilled. Instead, a measure of the crop residue cover was
obtained using a line-transect <A HREF="#Laf81">(Laflen et al.,
1981;</A> <A HREF="#Morr93">Morrison et al., 1993).</A> The 15.2 m line
had 100 beads or orange marks evenly spaced. At each sample location,
the line-transect was stretched diagonally across the direction of
tillage, and coincidences of the markers and pieces of crop residue on
the soil surface were visually counted. The line-transect was moved to a
different area and another count taken. This procedure was repeated
until five counts were taken at each field sample location. The number
of coincidences or <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>hits<FONT
FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> divided by the total number of
points observed (usually 500) is the fraction of residue cover.</P>

<B><A NAME="M4">Derived Variables</A>

<P>The water content of the green and brown standing vegetation, and surface

<P>Absorbed PAR (APAR) is the algebraic sum of incoming and outgoing flux
densities measured above and below a plant canopy <A HREF="#Asrar1">(Asrar et
al., 1989)</A>. Determination of APAR by the vegetation requires measuring four
streams of radiation: 1) PAR incoming at the top of the canopy (S), 2) PAR
transmitted through the canopy to the soil surface (T<SUB>C</SUB>), 3) PAR
reflected by the soil back into the canopy (R<SUB>S</SUB>), and 4) PAR
reflected by the canopy (R<SUB>C</SUB>) (Asrar et al., 1989; Daughtry et al.,

<P>The green leaf area index (LAI<SUB>g</SUB>) was computed as total LAI
weighted by the ratio of green standing biomass divided by total
standing biomass. Specific foliage area (SFA) was computed by dividing
total leaf area index by total standing biomass. Specific foliage area
provides a conversion factor to estimate biomass coverage from leaf area
derived from reflectance data. </P>

<H3><A NAME="M5"><P>Quality Control</A></H3>

<P>Data collected by the PAR sensors (AccuPAR, Sunceptometer, Line
Quantum Sensor) and LAI-2000 leaf area meters were downloaded daily and
scanned for missing observations and obviously erroneous data using a
spreadsheet. The most common and easily corrected errors were
measurements taken in the wrong order, e.g., transmitted PAR measured
before incoming PAR. Data from the LAI-2000 were exported in both text
and spreadsheet formats. The spreadsheet format was used to compute the
field mean and standard errors. </P>

<P>Vegetation data from the SGP97 Vegetation Data Sheet were entered into a
Paradox database and manually checked for entry errors. The vegetation data
were further checked during data analysis by comparing means and variances of
the samples within a field. When questionable data were found, data were
checked against the original data sheets to determine if an entry error had
been made. The data analysis was completed by importing the vegetation data
from the Paradox database into a spreadsheet where calculations of the derived
variables were made. </P>

<P>The vegetation variables <A HREF="veg_tab3.html">(Table 3)</A> were
analyzed by computing the sum of the two sub-samples from each sample
site, and the mean and standard error of the three sample sites in each
field. An analysis of variance was conducted using the SAS PROC MIXED
routine. The least significant differences computed from the analysis of
variance were used to determine the significance of the means of
vegetation within each location, and the differences in vegetation means
across locations.</P>

grass/pasture fields and least in the harvested wheat fields. Significantly
more wet green standing biomass was measured at El Reno than at either the
Central Facility or the Little Washita watershed. Wet green standing biomass
was slightly greater in the Little Washita watershed grass/pasture fields than
at the Central Facility. However, this difference was not significant. </P>

<P>While not statistically significant, the wet green standing biomass
in harvested wheat fields was greatest at the Central Facility and least
in the Little Washita watershed. During the sampling period, the Central
Facility was the wettest of the three sample areas and the harvested
wheat fields had more weeds and volunteer wheat than the other two
sampling areas. </P>

<P>Wet brown standing biomass was greatest in the wheat fields and least
in the grass/pasture fields. There were no significant differences in
the wet brown standing biomass among the three sampling areas in either

<P>Facility wheat fields. The water content was 56 percent in the
grass/pasture fields at the Central Facility, 66 percent in the El Reno
grass/pasture fields, and 61 percent in the Little Washita watershed
grass/pasture fields. The greatest water mass and water content
(79&nbsp;percent) in green standing biomass was measured in the Little
Washita watershed corn field. </P>

<P>Water mass in the brown standing biomass ranged from 7 to 21 g
m<SUP>-2</SUP> (Table 6). Water content in the brown standing biomass in
the grass/pasture fields was 33 percent in the El Reno sample area, 23
percent in the Little Washita sample area, and 15 percent at the Central
Facility. Water content of the brown standing biomass in harvested wheat
fields was 5 percent at both the Central Facility and El Reno sample
areas, and 4 percent in the Little Washita area. The differences between
the percent water content in the two different cover types is due to the
effect of the standing green biomass. Because the green standing biomass
is transpiring, the humidity in the canopy is greater than in the
harvested wheat fields, thus allowing the brown standing biomass to
retain more water. </P>

<P>Water mass in the surface residue was greatest in the El Reno
sampling area. The water mass in the surface residue in both the
grass/pasture and harvested wheat fields was significantly greater than
water mass in the surface residue of both vegetative types in the Little
Washita sampling area <A HREF="#Tab6">(Table 6)</A> . The absolute mass
of water in the surface residue at both the Central Facility and in the
Little Washita sampling area are approximately the same. However, the
water mass in the Central Facility grass/pasture and harvested wheat
surface residue was not significantly different from the grass/pasture
surface residue water mass at El Reno. This was due to the large
variations of water mass at both the Central Facility and El Reno
sampling sites. The water content in the surface residue ranged from 21
to 40 percent in the grass/pasture fields at the three sampling areas,
and from 6 to 50 percent in the harvested wheat fields. </P>

<P>Total water mass in the aboveground vegetation and surface residue
was significantly greater in the grass/pasture field in the El Reno
sampling area <A HREF="#Tab6">(Table 6)</A> than at the two other
sampling areas. Total water mass in the grass/pasture fields at both the
Central Facility and Little Washita sampling areas was only slightly
less than the total water mass in the harvested wheat fields at El Reno.
There are large differences among the total water mass across vegetation
type and sampling area. However, there are few significant differences
due to the large variability of the total water mass as seen in the
large standard errors of the means. Total water content of the
aboveground biomass ranged from 6 to 38 percent in the harvested wheat
fields to 43 to 55 percent in the grass/pasture fields in the three
sampling areas.</P>

<B><P><A NAME="R4">Leaf Area and Plant Height</A>
</B>
<P>Consistent with the greater amounts of green and brown standing
biomass in the grass/pasture fields in the El Reno sampling area, both
total and green leaf area index (LAI) were significantly greater than
the LAI of the grass/pasture fields at the other two sample areas <A
HREF="#Tab7">(Table 7)</A>. The green LAI from the harvested wheat
fields was significantly less than the grass/pasture fields. The largest
average LAI was measured in the corn field. The mean grass/pasture LAI
at the El Reno sampling area was only slightly less than the corn field
LAI. Several El Reno grass/pasture fields had mean LAIs greater than the
corn field <A HREF="veg_tab3.html">(Table 3)</A>. </P>

<P>The specific foliage area of the grass/pasture fields was
significantly greater than of the harvested wheat fields <A
HREF="#Tab7">(Table 7)</A> due to the absence of leaves in the harvested
wheat fields. Although the specific foliage area was greater at the
Central Facility sampling area than at the other two areas, it was not
significantly greater. </P>

<P>The El Reno grass/pasture fields had the tallest average plant
height, approximately 1.7 times taller than either the wheat fields in
the three sampling areas or the grass/pasture fields in the Little
Washita and Central Facility sampling areas <A HREF="#Tab7">(Table
7)</A>. The grass/pasture fields at the Central Facility and Little
Washita sampling areas were not significantly different from each other
or from the height of the harvested wheat fields. Plants in the corn and
unharvested wheat fields were both taller than the harvested wheat and
grass/pasture fields. With more samples, it would most likely
demonstrate that the corn plants were significantly (statistically)
taller than the grass/pasture fields at the El Reno area. </P>

<P>LAI and green biomass measured within these fields. The
fraction of PAR reflected from the soil (fRs) was measured in
harvested and tilled wheat fields in each sample area, and it is equal
to the fraction of PAR reflected from the canopy (fRc). For the
grass/pasture, harvested wheat, mature wheat, and corn fields, fRs is
estimated using Eq. 6 with fRc of the bare soil for each sampling area
used as R<SUB>BS</SUB>.</P>

<B><A NAME="Disc">DISCUSSION</A>
</B>
<P>Significant differences were found in the measured vegetation
variables as a function of location and vegetation type. As expected,
these differences were associated with differences in the amount of
vegetative growth on the surface. The greatest variability was
observed in the grass/pasture sites across the three sampling areas.
Standing brown biomass in the harvested wheat fields was relatively
constant across the three sampling areas. This would be expected
because harvest practices tend to be rather constant and leave
approximately the same length of stubble standing after the grain is
harvested. Differences in the wheat green standing biomass were a
function of the length of time after harvest and soil moisture between
the time of harvest and sampling. In those areas where the soil
moisture was high and more than a week had passed between harvest and
sampling, considerable green biomass was observed in the harvested
wheat fields. The largest green biomass in harvested wheat was
measured in the fields at the Central Facility. These wheat fields had
been harvested before the last week in June. Rainfall in the Central
Facility area was quite high during the period from 20-30 June. This
resulted in </P>

<P>significant growth of weeds and volunteer wheat. Conditions were drier in
the western regions of the Little Washita sampling area where most of the wheat
fields were located, resulting in very little volunteer wheat or weed growth in
the standing stubble. </P>

<P>Water content as a percent of wet green biomass was a function of the
age of plants and rainfall. This is supported by the large water content
in the volunteer wheat and weeds sampled from the harvested wheat sites
compared to the water content in the grass/pasture fields. Water content
in the corn was also quite high compared to the grass/pasture
fields.</P>

<P>Water content in the brown standing biomass was higher in the
grass/pasture sites than in harvested wheat fields. This difference was
due to the different exposures of the brown standing biomass to the
atmosphere. Green standing biomass surrounded the brown standing biomass
in the grass/pasture fields reducing the exposure of the brown standing
biomass to the wind and sun. Brown standing biomass, the predominate
form of vegetation in the harvested wheat fields, was not sheltered from
the wind or sun. In addition, the evapotranspiration would be less in
the harvested wheat fields, so the humidity would be lower in the canopy
than in the grass/pasture field canopies.</P>
