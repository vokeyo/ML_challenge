comprising the pharmacy shall be physically separated from the
rest of the establishment, so that access to the pharmacy and
drugs is not available when a pharmacist is not on duty.
Identification of the area within the pharmacy by use of the

Prescriptions.</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>No drug for which a prescription is required by the
provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or by the
commissioner of health shall be distributed or dispensed to any
person except upon a prescription written by a person legally
authorized to issue such prescription. Such drug shall be
compounded or dispensed by a licensed pharmacist, and no such
drug shall be dispensed without affixing to the immediate
container in which the drug is sold or dispensed a label bearing
the name and address of the owner of the establishment in which
it was dispensed, the date compounded, the number of the
prescription under which it is recorded in the pharmacist&#39;s
prescription files, the name of the prescriber, the name and
address of the patient, and the directions for the use of the
drug by the patient as given upon the prescription. The
prescribing and dispensing of a drug which is a controlled
substance shall be subject to additional requirements provided in
article thirty-three of the public health law. The words
&quot;drug&quot; and &quot;prescription required drug&quot;
within the meaning of this article shall not be construed to
include soft or hard contact lenses, eyeglasses, or any other
device for the aid or correction of vision. Nothing in this
subdivision shall prevent a pharmacy from furnishing a drug to
another pharmacy which does not have such drug in stock for the
purpose of filling a prescription.</li>
<li>A prescription may not be refilled unless it bears a contrary
instruction and indicates on its face the number of times it may
be refilled. A prescription may not be refilled more times than
allowed on the prescription. The date of each refilling must be
indicated on the original prescription. Prescriptions for
controlled substances shall be refilled only pursuant to article
thirty-three of the public health law.</li>
<li>A copy of a prescription for a controlled substance shall not
be furnished to the patient but may be furnished to any licensed
practitioner authorized to write such prescription. Copies of
other prescriptions shall be furnished to the patient at his
request, but such copies are issued for the informational
purposes of the prescribers only, and shall be so worded.</li>
<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Oral prescriptions for controlled substances shall be filled
pursuant to article thirty-three of the public health law. A
pharmacist may fill an oral prescription for a drug, other than a
controlled substance, made by a practitioner legally authorized
to prescribe drugs. An oral authorization for the refill of a
prescription, other than a prescription for a controlled
substance, may be made by a practitioner legally authorized to
prescribe drugs. The pharmacist receiving such oral authorization
for the refill of a prescription shall write on the reverse side
of the original prescription the date, time, and name of he
practitioner authorizing the refill of the prescription. An oral
prescription or an oral authorization for the refill of a
prescription for the drug, other than a controlled substance, may
be communicated by an employee of the prescribing practitioner;
provided however the pharmacist shall:
<ol type="i">
<li>contemporaneously reduce such prescription to writing;</li>
<li>dispense the substance in conformity with the labeling
requirements applicable to a written prescription; and</li>
<li>make a good faith effort to verify the employee&#39;s
identity if the employee is unknown to the pharmacist.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Oral prescriptions for patients in general hospitals, nursing
homes, residential health care facilities as defined in section
twenty-eight hundred one of the public health law, hospitals as
defined in subdivision ten of section 1.03 of the mental hygiene
law, or developmental centers or developmental disabilities
services offices listed in subdivision (b) of section 13.17 of
the mental hygiene law, may be communicated to by a pharmacist
serving as a vendor of pharmaceutical services based upon a
contractual arrangement by an agent designated by and under the
direction of the prescriber or the institution. Such agent shall
be a health care practitioner currently licensed and registered
under this title.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Records of all prescriptions filled or refilled shall be
maintained for a period of at least five years and upon request
made available for inspection and copying by a representative of
the department. Such records shall indicate date of filling or
refilling, doctor&#39;s name, patient&#39;s name and address and
the name or initials of the pharmacist who prepared, compounded,
or dispensed the prescription. Records of prescriptions for
controlled substances shall be maintained pursuant to
requirements of article thirty-three of the public health
law.</li>
<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Every prescription written in this state by a person
authorized to issue such prescription shall be on prescription
forms containing one line for the prescriber&#39;s signature. The
prescriber&#39;s signature shall validate the prescription.
Imprinted conspicuously in eight point upper case type
immediately below the signature line shall be the words:
&quot;THIS PRESCRIPTION WILL BE FILLED GENERICALLY UNLESS
PRESCRIBER WRITES &#39;d a w&#39; IN THE BOX BELOW&quot;. Unless
the prescriber writes d a w in such box in the prescriber&#39;s
own handwriting, the prescriber&#39;s signature shall designate
approval of substitution by a pharmacist of a drug product
pursuant to paragraph (o) of subdivision one of section two
hundred six of the public health law. No other letters or marks
in such box shall prohibit substitution. No prescription forms
used or intended to be used by a person authorized to issue a
prescription shall have &#39;d a w&#39; preprinted in such box.
Such box shall be placed directly under the signature line and
shall be three-quarters inch in length and one-half inch in
height. Immediately below such box shall be imprinted in six
point type the words &quot;Dispense As Written&quot;.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no state official,
agency, board or other entity shall promulgate any regulation or
guideline modifying those elements of the prescription form&#39;s
contents specified in this subdivision. To the extent otherwise
permitted by law, a prescriber may modify only those elements of
the prescription form&#39;s contents not specified in this
subdivision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section
or any other law, when a generic drug is not available and the
brand name drug originally prescribed is available and the
pharmacist agrees to dispense the brand name product for a price
that will not exceed the price that would have been charged for
the generic substitute had it been available, substitution of a
generic drug product will not be required. If the generic drug
product is not available and a medical emergency situation, which
for purposes of this section is defined as any condition
requiring alleviation of severe pain or which threatens to cause
disability or take life if not promptly treated, exists, then the
pharmacist may dispense the brand name product at his regular
price. In such instances the pharmacist must record the date,
hour and nature of the medical emergency on the back of the
prescription and keep a copy of all such prescriptions.</li>
<li>The prescriber shall inform the patient whether he or she has
prescribed a brand name or its generic equivalent drug
product.</li>
<li>The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a
hospital as defined in article twenty-eight of the public health
law.</li>
<li>No prescriber shall be subjected to civil liability arising
solely from authorizing, in accordance with this subdivision, the
substitution by a pharmacist of a drug product pursuant to
paragraph (o) of subdivision one of section two hundred six of
the public health law.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>No prescription for a drug written in this state by a person
authorized to issue such prescription shall be on a prescription
form which authorizes the dispensing or compounding of any other
drug.</li>
<li>With respect to drugs other than controlled substances, the
provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to pharmacists
employed by or providing services under contract to general
hospitals, nursing homes, residential health care facilities as
defined in section twenty-eight hundred one of the public health
law, hospitals as defined in subdivision ten of section 1.03 of
the mental hygiene law, or developmental centers or developmental
disabilities services offices listed in subdivision (b) of
section 13.17 of the mental hygiene law, who dispense drugs in
the course of said employment or in the course of providing such
services under contract. With respect to such pharmacists, each
prescription shall be transcribed on a patient specific
prescription form.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Every prescription (whether or not for a controlled
substance) written in this state by a person authorized to issue
such prescription and containing the prescriber&#39;s signature
shall, in addition to such signature, be imprinted or stamped
legibly and conspicuously with the printed name of the prescriber
who has signed the prescription. The imprinted or stamped name of
the signing prescriber shall appear in an appropriate location on
the prescription form and shall not be entered in or upon any
space or line reserved for the prescriber&#39;s signature. The
imprinted or stamped name shall not be employed as a substitute
for, or fulfill any legal requirement otherwise mandating that
the prescription be signed by the prescriber.</li>
<li>No person, corporation, association or other entity, not
licensed to issue a prescription pursuant to this title, shall
wilfully cause prescription forms, blanks or facsimiles thereof
to be disseminated to any person other than a person who is
licensed to issue a prescription pursuant to this title. A
violation of this subdivision shall be a class B misdemeanor
punishable in accordance with the provisions of the penal
law.<br /></li>

Seizure.</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Any drug, device or cosmetic that is adulterated, misbranded
or may not be sold under the provisions of this chapter, may be
seized on petition or complaint of the board and condemned in the
supreme court of any county in which it is found. Seizure shall
be made:
<ol type="a">
<li>by process pursuant to the petition or complaint, or</li>
<li>if the secretary or other officer designated by him has
probable cause to believe that the article
<ol>
<li>is one which may not be sold under the provisions of section
sixty-eight hundred seventeen of this chapter, or</li>
<li>is adulterated, or</li>
<li>is so misbranded as to be dangerous to health. The article
shall be seized by order of such officer. The order shall
describe the article to be seized, the place where the article is
located, and the officer or employee making the seizure. The
officer, in lieu of taking actual possession, may affix a tag or
other appropriate marking to the article giving notice that the
article has been quarantined and warning all persons not to
remove or dispose of it by sale or otherwise until permission for
removal or disposal is given by the officer or the court. In case
of seizures or quarantine, pursuant to such order, the
jurisdiction of such court shall attach upon such seizure or
quarantine, and a petition or complaint for condemnation shall be
filed promptly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The procedure for cases under this section shall conform as
much as possible to the procedure for attachment. Any issue of
fact joined in any case under this section shall be tried by jury
on the demand of either party. The court at any time after
seizure and up to the time of trial shall allow by order any
party or his agent or attorney to obtain a representative sample
of the condemned material, a true copy of the analysis on which
the proceeding was based, and the identifying marks or numbers,
if any, on the packages from which the samples analyzed were
obtained.</li>
<li>Any drug, device or cosmetic condemned under this section
shall be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may
direct after the decree in accordance with the provisions of this
section. The proceeds of the sale, if any, shall be paid into the
state treasury after deduction for legal costs and charges.
However, the drug, device or cosmetic shall not be sold contrary
to the provisions of this article. After entry of the decree, if
the owner of the condemned articles pays the costs of the
proceeding and posts a sufficient bond as security that the
articles will not be disposed of contrary to the provisions of
this article, the court may by order direct that the seized
articles be delivered to the owner to be destroyed or brought
into conformance with this article under supervision of the
secretary. The expenses of the supervision shall be borne by the
person obtaining the release under bond. Any drug condemned by
reason of its being a new drug which may not be sold under this
article shall be disposed of by destruction.</li>
<li>When the decree of condemnation is entered, court costs and
fees, storage and other expense shall be awarded against the
person, if any, intervening as claimant of the condemned
articles.</li>
<li>In any proceeding against the board, or the secretary, or an
agent of either, because of seizure, or quarantine, under this

liable if the court finds that there was probable cause for the
acts done by them.<br /></li>

<h4><a name="sect6815" id="sect6815">&sect;6815. Adulterating,
misbranding and substituting.</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Adultered drugs. A drug or device shall be deemed to be
adulterated:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<ol>
<li>If it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or
decomposed substance; or</li>
<li>if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary
conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth, or
whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health; or</li>
<li>if it is a drug and its container is composed, in whole or in
part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render
the contents injurious to health; or</li>
<li>if it is a drug and it bears or contains, for purposes of
coloring only, a coal-tar color other than one from a batch that
has been certified in accordance with regulations provided in
this article.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If it purports to be, or is represented as, a drug the name
of which is recognized in an official compendium, and its
strength differs from, or its quality or purity falls below, the
standard set forth in such compendium. Such determination as to
strength, quality or purity shall be made in accordance with the
tests or methods of assay set forth in such compendium, or, in
the absence or inadequacy of such tests or methods of assay, then
in accordance with tests or methods of assay prescribed by
regulations of the board of pharmacy as promulgated under this
article. Deviations from the official assays may be made in the
quantities of samples and reagents employed, provided they are in
proportion to the quantities stated in the official compendium.
No drug defined in an official compendium shall be deemed to be
adulterated under this paragraph because (1) it exceeds the
standard of strength therefor set forth in such compendium, if
such difference is plainly stated on its label; or (2) it falls
below the standard of strength, quality, or purity therefor set
forth in such compendium if such difference is plainly stated on
its label, except that this clause shall apply only to such
drugs, or classes of drugs, as are specified in regulations which
the board shall promulgate when, as applied to any drug, or class
of drugs, the prohibition of such difference is not necessary for
the protection of the public health. Whenever a drug is
recognized in both the United States pharmacopoeia and the
homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States, it shall be
subject to the requirements of the United States pharmacopoeia
unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homeopathic drug,
in which case it shall be subject to the provisions of the
homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States and not to those
of the United States pharmacopoeia.</li>
<li>If it is not subject to the provisions of paragraph b of this
subdivision and its strength differs from, or its purity or
quality falls below, that which it purports or is represented to
possess.</li>
<li>If it is a drug and any substance has been
<ol>
<li>mixed or packed therewith so as to reduce its quality or
strength or</li>
<li>substituted wholly or in part therefor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If it is sold under or by a name not recognized in or
according to a formula not given in the United States
pharmacopoeia or the national formulary but that is found in some
other standard work on pharmacology recognized by the board, and
it differs in strength, quality or purity from the strength,
quality or purity required, or the formula prescribed in, the
standard work.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Misbranded and substituted drugs and devices. A drug or
device shall be deemed to be misbranded:
<ol type="a">
<li>If its labeling is false or misleading in any
particular.</li>
<li>If in package form, unless it bears a label containing (1)
the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or
distributor; and (2) an accurate statement of the quantity of the
contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count:
Provided, that under clause (2) of this paragraph the board may
establish reasonable variations as to quantity and exemptions as
to small packages.</li>
<li>If any word, statement, or other information required by or
under authority of this article to appear on the label or
labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such
conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements,
designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to
render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary
individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.</li>
<li>If it is for use by man and contains any quantity of the
narcotic or hypnotic substance alpha eucaine, barbituric acid,
beta eucaine, bromal, cannabis, carbromal, chloral, coca,
cocaine, codeine, heroin, marihuana, morphine, opium,
paraldehyde, peyote, or sulphonmethane; or any chemical
derivative of such substance, which derivative has been by the
secretary, after investigation, found to be, and by regulations
under this article, or by regulations promulgated by the board,
designated as, habit forming; unless its label bears the name and
quantity, or proportion, of such substance or derivative and in
juxtaposition therewith the statement &quot;Warning--May be habit
forming.&quot;</li>
<li>If it is a drug and is not designated solely by a name
recognized in an official compendium unless its label bears (1)
the common or usual name of the drug, if such there be; and (2)
in case it is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the common
or usual name of each active ingredient, including the kind and
quantity by percentage or amount of any alcohol, and also
including, whether active or not, the name and quantity or
proportion of any bromides, ether, chloroform, acetanilid,
acetphenetidin, amidopyrine, antipyrine, atropine, hyoscine,
hyoscyamine, arsenic, digitalis, digitalis glucosides, mercury,
ouabain, strophanthin, strychnine, thyroid, or any derivative or
preparation of any such substances, contained therein: Provided,
that, to the extent that compliance with the requirements of
clause (2) of this paragraph is impracticable, exemptions shall
be established by regulations promulgated by the board.</li>
<li>Unless its labeling bears (1) adequate directions for use;
and (2) such adequate warnings against use in those pathological
conditions orby children where its use may be dangerous to
health, or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of
administration or application, in such manner and form, as are
necessary for the protection of users: Provided, that, where any
requirement of clause (1) of this paragraph, as applied to any
drug or device, is not necessary for the protection of the public
health, the board shall promulgate regulations exempting such
drug or device from such requirement.</li>
<li>If it purports to be a drug the name of which is recognized
in an official compendium, unless it is packaged and labeled as
prescribed therein: Provided, that, the method of packing may be
modified with the consent of the secretary in accordance with
regulations promulgated by the board. Whenever a drug is
recognized in both the United States pharmacopoeia and the
homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States, it shall be
subject to the requirements of the United States pharmacopoeia
with respect to packaging and labeling unless it is labeled and
offered for sale as a homeopathic drug, in which case it shall be
subject to the provisions of the homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the
United States, and not to those of the United States
pharmacopoeia.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If it is a drug and its container is so made, formed or
filled as to be misleading;</li>
<li>If it is an imitation of another drug; (3) if it is offered
for sale under the name of another drug; or</li>
<li>If it bears a copy, counterfeit, or colorable imitation of
the trademark, label, container or identifying name or design of
another drug.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage, or with
the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended or suggested in
the labeling thereof.</li>
<li>Except as required by article thirty-three of the public
health law, the labeling provisions of this article shall not
apply to the compounding and dispensing of drugs on the written
prescription of a physician, a dentist, a podiatrist or a
veterinarian, which prescription when filled shall be kept on
file for at least five years by the pharmacist or druggist. Such
drug shall bear a label containing the name and place of business
of the dispenser, the serial number and date of the prescription,
directions for use as may be stated in the prescription, name and
address of the patient and the name of the physician or other
practitioner authorized by law to issue the prescription. In
addition, such label shall contain the proprietary or brand name
of the drug and, if applicable, the strength of the contents,
unless the person issuing the prescription explicitly states on
the prescription, in his own handwriting, that the name of the
drug and the strength thereof should not appear on the
label.<br /></li>

prescription.</li>
<li>The board may add to or may delete from any of the schedules

<h4><a name="sect6825" id="sect6825">&sect;6825. Proof required
in prosecution for certain violations.</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>In an action or proceeding, civil or criminal, against a
person for violating such provisions of this article which relate
to the possession of, compounding, retailing or dispensing of
misbranded, substituted or imitated drugs, poisons or cosmetics,
when it shall be necessary that an analysis be made for the
purpose of establishing the quality of such drug, poison or
cosmetic so as to determine the fact of misbranding, substituting
or imitating, then it shall be required to prove at the trial or
hearing of such action or proceeding, that the person, taking the
same for analysis separated it into two representative parts,
hermetically or otherwise effectively and completely sealed,
delivered one such sealed part to the seller, manufacturer,
wholesaler, pharmacist, druggist or storekeeper from whose
premises such sample was taken and delivered the other part so
sealed to the chemist designated by the state board of pharmacy;
and the facts herein required to be proven shall be alleged in
the complaint or information by which such action or proceeding
was begun. The rules of the board shall be proven prima facie by
the certificate of the secretary.</li>
<li>Any person accused of violation of any of the provisions of
this article relating to adulterating, misbranding, substitution
or imitation shall not be prosecuted or convicted or suffer any
of the penalties, fines or forfeitures for such violation, if he
establishes upon the hearing or trial that the drug, device or
cosmetic alleged to be adulterated, misbranded, substituted or
imitated was purchased by him under a written guaranty of the
manufacturer or seller to the effect that said drug, device or
cosmetic was not adulterated or misbranded, within the meaning of
this article and proves that he has not adulterated, misbranded,
substituted or imitated the same, provided the seller has taken
due precaution to maintain the standard set for the drug, device
or cosmetic. A guaranty, in order to be a defense to a
prosecution or to prevent conviction or to afford protection,
must state that the drug, device or cosmetic to which it refers
is not adulterated, misbranded, substituted or imitated within
the meaning of the provisions of this article and must state also
the full name and place of business of the manufacturer,
wholesaler, jobber or other person from whom the drug, device or
cosmetic was purchased, and the date of purchase. The act,
omission or failure of any officer, agent or other employee
acting for or employed by any person within the scope of his
authority or employment shall in every case be the act, omission
or failure of such person as well as that of the officer, agent
or other employee, and such person shall be equally liable for
violations of this article by a partnership, association or
corporation, and every member of the partnership or association
and the directors and general officers of the corporation and the
general manager of the partnership, association or corporation
shall be individually liable and any action, prosecution or
proceeding authorized by this article may be brought against any
or all of such persons. When any prosecution under this article

<li>No publisher, radio-broadcast licensee, advertising agency,
or agency or medium for the dissemination of advertising, except
the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller of the commodity
to which the false advertisement relates, shall be subject to the
penalties provided by this article by reason of the dissemination
by him of any false advertisement, unless he has refused, on the
request of the secretary, to furnish the secretary the name and
post-office address of the manufacturer, packer, distributor,
seller or advertising agency, who caused him to disseminate such
advertisement.</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="sect6826" id="sect6826">&sect;6826. Drug retail
price lists.</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Every pharmacy shall compile a drug retail price list, which
shall contain the names of the drugs on the list provided by the
board and the pharmacy`s corresponding retail prices for each
drug. Every pharmacy shall update its drug retail list at least
weekly. Every pharmacy shall provide the drug retail price list
to any person upon request.</li>
<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>The list provided by the board shall be prepared at least
annually by the board and distributed to each pharmacy in the
state. The list shall be a compendium of the one hundred fifty
most frequently prescribed drugs together with their usual
dosages for which a prescription is required by the provisions of
the &quot;Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act&quot; (21 U.S.C.
301, et seq.; 52 Stat. 1040, et seq.), as amended, or by the
commissioner of health. The board shall make the compendium list
available to each pharmacy free of charge, both in printed form
and in an electronic form that can be used to produce the
pharmacy&#39;s drug retail list. The board shall provide the
compendium list to the department of health.</li>
<li>The drug retail price list shall contain an advisory
statement by the department alerting consumers to the need to
tell their health care practitioner and pharmacist about all the
medications they may be taking and to ask them how to avoid
harmful interactions between drugs, if any. A pharmacy may
include on its drug retail price list a statement:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>concerning discounts from its listed retail prices that may
be available to consumers and</li>
<li>any limitations that the pharmacy may have as to what group
or groups of customers it serves.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The pharmacy`s corresponding retail price means the actual
price to be paid by a retail purchaser to the pharmacy for any
listed drug at the listed dosage. However, upon implementation of
the prescription drug retail price list database by the
department of health under section two hundred seventy-six-a of
the public health law, the pharmacy&#39;s corresponding retail
price shall mean the price sent to it by the department of health
under that section.</li>
<li>Pharmacies shall have a sign notifying people of the
availability of the drug retail price list and the availability
of the department of health prescription drug retail price list
database and the web address of that database, conspicuously
posted at or adjacent to the place in the pharmacy where
prescriptions are presented for compounding and dispensing, in
the waiting area for customers, or in the area where prescribed
drugs are delivered.</li>
<li>Nothing contained herein shall prevent a pharmacy from
changing and charging the current retail price at any time,
provided that the listed price is updated at least weekly to
reflect the new retail price.</li>
<li>The commissioner shall make regulations necessary to
implement this section, including how this section is applied to
mail-order and internet pharmacies.</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="sect6827" id="sect6827">&sect;6827. Mandatory
continuing education.</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Each licensed pharmacist required under article one hundred
thirty of this chapter to register triennially with the
department to practice in the state shall comply with provisions
of the mandatory continuing education requirements prescribed in
subdivision two of this section except as set forth in paragraphs
(b) and (c) of this subdivision. Pharmacists who do not satisfy
the mandatory continuing education requirements shall not
practice until they have met such requirements, and they have
been issued a registration certificate, except that a pharmacist
may practice without having met such requirements if he or she is
issued a conditional registration certificate pursuant to
subdivision three of this section.</li>
<li>Pharmacists shall be exempt from the mandatory continuing
education requirement for the triennial registration period
during which they are first licensed. In accord with the intent
of this section, adjustment to the mandatory continuing education
requirement may be granted by the department for reasons of
health certified by an appropriate health care professional, for
extended active duty with the armed forces of the United States,
or for other good cause acceptable to the department which may
prevent compliance.</li>
<li>A licensed pharmacist not engaged in practice as determined
by the department, shall be exempt from the mandatory continuing
education requirement upon the filing of a statement with the
department declaring such status. Any licensee who returns to the
practice of pharmacy during the triennial registration period
shall notify the department prior to reentering the profession
and shall meet such mandatory education requirements as shall be
prescribed by regulations of the commissioner.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>During each triennial registration period an applicant for
registration shall complete a minimum of forty-five hours of
acceptable formal continuing education, as specified in
subdivision four of this section, provided that no more than
twenty-two hours of such continuing education shall consist of
self-study courses. Any pharmacist whose first registration date
following the effective date of this section occurs less than
three years from such effective date, but on or after January
first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, shall complete continuing
education hours on a prorated basis at the rate of one and
one-quarter hours per month for the period beginning January
first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven up to the first registration
date thereafter. A licensee who has not satisfied the mandatory
continuing education requirements shall not be issued a triennial
registration certificate by the department and shall not practice
unless and until a conditional registration certificate is issued
as provided for in subdivision three of this section. Continuing
education hours taken during one triennium may not be transferred
to a subsequent triennium.</li>
<li>The department, in its discretion, may issue a conditional
registration to a licensee who fails to meet the continuing
education requirements established in subdivision two of this
section but who agrees to make up any deficiencies and complete
any additional education which the department may require. The
fee for such a conditional registration shall be the same as, and
in addition to, the fee for the triennial registration. The
duration of such conditional registration shall be determined by
the department but shall not exceed one year. Any licensee who is
notified of the denial of registration for failure to submit
evidence, satisfactory to the department, of required continuing
education and who practices pharmacy without such registration,
may be subject to disciplinary proceedings pursuant to section
sixty-five hundred ten of this chapter.</li>
<li>As used in subdivision two of this section, &quot;acceptable
formal continuing education&quot; shall mean formal courses of
learning which contribute to professional practice in pharmacy
and which meet the standards prescribed by regulations of the
commissioner. The department may, in its discretion and as needed
to contribute to the health and welfare of the public, require
the completion of continuing education courses in specific
subjects. To fulfill this mandatory continuing education
requirement, courses must be taken from a sponsor approved by the
department, pursuant to the regulations of the commissioner.</li>
<li>Pharmacists shall maintain adequate documentation of
completion of acceptable formal continuing education and shall
provide such documentation at the request of the department.
Failure to provide such documentation upon the request of the
department shall be an act of misconduct subject to disciplinary
proceedings pursuant to section sixty-five hundred ten of this
chapter.</li>
<li>The mandatory continuing education fee shall be forty-five
dollars, shall be payable on or before the first day of each
triennial registration period, and shall be paid in addition to
the triennial registration fee required by section sixty-eight
hundred five of this article.<br /></li></ol>
<h4><a name="sect6828" id="sect6828">* &sect;6828. Certificates  of  administration.</a></h4>
<ol><li>No pharmacist shall
  administer immunizing agents without  a  certificate  of  administration
  issued by the department pursuant to regulations of the commissioner.</li>
    <li>The  fee  for a certificate of administration shall be one hundred
  dollars and shall be paid on a triennial basis.  A  certificate  may  be
  suspended  or  revoked  in  the  same  manner  as  a license to practice
  pharmacy. <br /><span class="note">* NB Effective until March 31, 2012</span></li></ol>
