<span class="title">Welcome to the VermontArcheoMap Information System!</span> 
<p>
VermontArcheoMap is a GIS-based mapping and information system that allows users to view and better understand potential locations of precontact Native American archeological sites in Vermont.  Twelve map layers derived from a GIS-based geoprocessing model that emulates portions of the Vermont Environmental Predictive Model comprise the core of the VermontArcheoMap information system. These map layers are thought to represent environmental or cultural factors conducive to precontact habitation and resource extraction activities.  The eleven analytical layers are: drainage proximity, waterbody proximity, wetland proximity, drainage-waterbody proximity, drainage-drainage confluence proximity, head of drainage proximity, waterfall proximity, paleo lake soils proximity, glacial outwash and kame terrace soils presence, floodplain soils presence, and level terrain presence.
</p>
<p>VermontArcheoMap offers preliminary, coarse information about the Native American habitability of any given 10 meter area of Vermont but it not a "sensitivity map." For example, an area that scores 6 layers is not more sensitive than an area that scores 1 layer. Over 12,000 years of changing climates, environments, cultural traditions, and distribution of food and other key resources, significant archeological sites may indeed exist in areas that score only a single layer. Areas on the map with a greater convergence of environmental and cultural factors, however, may have a higher density of sites.  Map users are encouraged to look at environmental and cultural characteristics of "neighborhoods," rather than intensely focusing on any one 10 meter, or 1000, meter, area. 
VermontArcheoMap may also suggest possible locations of Contact period Native American habitation sites (after 1609) and Euro-American early settlement residential sites since habitation sites in these times were intimately intertwined to environmental factors. VermontArcheoMap does not contain information about possible locations of Native  American burials and cemeteries, stone quarry sites, caves and rock shelters, religious sites, trails, and other kinds of special purpose sites that represent complex human behavior over the 12,000 year span. The environmental layers of VermontArcheoMap are not intended to help locate historic period archeological site.
The environmental layers have not been field verified. Thus, more detailed desk review and field inspection may demonstrate that the characteristics of a map layer are incorrect in a given parcel of land. Developers should inform archeologists if a project area contains conditions that either inhibited precontact habitation, or, make it unlikely that archeological sites exist (for example, extremely steep slopes, extensive deep ground disturbance, previous development, etc.).
</p>
<p>Using VermontArcheoMap:  VermontArcheoMap is intended to be used as a compliment to the VT Division for Historic Preservation's "Environmental Predictive Model for Locating Precontact Archeological Sites" (VTEPM). It is not a substitute for the VTEPM.  The <a href="http://www.earthanalytic.com/Mapping/Vermont/VermontEPM11062006.xls">Archeological Resources Assessment Form</a> combines the VTEPM and the VermontArcheoMap layers so that archeologists can start recording, tracking, and comparing the VTEPM and VermontArcheoMap.  Qualified archaeological contractors may use the <a href="http://www.earthanalytic.com/Mapping/Vermont/VVT_ArchSite_InventoryNewSiteTemplate.zip">VAI site form template</a>, an access database, to record new sites.  Completed site form databases should be delivered to <A href="mailto:Giovanna.peebles@state.vt.us">Giovanna Peebles</a>.  <br><br>Currently, this site is password protected and accessible only to qualified archeological professionals.  Please note that this is an experimental site currently in beta test phase. Additional modifications and temporary outages should be anticipated during the test phase.  Please contact us with any problems and ideas for improvement. Dial-up internet users can increase performance by resizing their browser windows to a smaller extent than the default.

<span class="title">DISCLAIMER</span>
<p>
 The VermontArcheoMap information system has been implemented to provide a widely accessible method of displaying preliminary, precontact archeological habitability information to archeologists, other professionals, landowners, communities, developers, conservation organizations, and the public. Maps are to be used for display or preliminary planning purposes only. Data are not survey quality and, therefore, are not to be used as a basis for legal decisions. The data layers have been developed from the best available sources at the time of their creation. These original sources vary in scale and accuracy which determines the relative map accuracy of the digital data layers.
