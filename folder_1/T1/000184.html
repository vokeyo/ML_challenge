<p> <span class="startletter">C</span>alifornia  is famous for its golden sandy beaches, attracting millions of tourists and  their dollars every year. To keep the beaches tourist-brochure perfect, workers  may mechanically rake a beach to remove trash left by beach goers, as well as  kelp and debris washed ashore by the tides.</p>
<p>Researchers are finding that raking also can sweep away a  myriad of small creatures that are vital to ecosystem health. </p>
<p>As a result, local beach managers, researchers, the  California Coastal Commission, and others have teamed up to develop and  encourage more ecologically friendly beach management practices, and to help  educate the public about the need for more natural beaches.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to be more proactive than reactive,” says  Karen Martin, a professor of biology at Pepperdine  University in Malibu. “We’re definitely moving in the right  direction here.”</p>
<h4>Catchall</h4>
<p>Beach grooming is practiced in many states and throughout  the world, but the term is a catchall describing a variety of methods of  raking, sieving, and bulldozing sand to remove material from a beach.</p>
<p>It is estimated that over a hundred miles of Southern California beaches are groomed, primarily by  tractors with forks on the front and rakes on the rear. Six-wheel dump trucks  haul kelp, trash, and debris off the beaches.</p>
<p>In San Diego,  beach grooming has been regularly practiced since the 1960s, with reports of  beach grooming from the 40s and 50s, says Dennis Simmons, beach manager for the  city’s Park and Recreation Department.</p>
<p>Their operations consist of raking up and removing excess  kelp, cleaning the sand of debris, which can include fire rings and dead  animals such as seals and whales, and making sure lifeguards have emergency  access to the water. They also empty 1,000 fifty-five-gallon trashcans and  provide overall beach management, trail management, and bluff maintenance,  Simmons says.</p>
<p>He notes that 35 to 40 percent of the city’s beaches are  physically maintained, and the ones that are groomed “are the ones that have  the greatest impact as far as our patrons are concerned.”</p>
<h4>Beaches as Business</h4>
<p>California’s  beaches are recognized as an enormous economic engine in the state, drawing in  billions of tourist dollars every year. </p>
<p>“We have 2 million people living in San Diego and 20 million tourists every  year,” notes Simmons. “This is a significant economic issue, as well as an  overall safety and cleanliness issue.”</p>
<p>He notes that San    Diego beaches that receive grooming are often in large  urban areas and are used daily by thousands of visitors year-round. </p>
<h4>Beaches as Ecosystems</h4>
<p>Ecologically, the state’s beaches are just as rich, says  Jenny Dugan, associate research biologist at the Marine Science Institute at  the University of California in Santa    Barbara. </p>
<p>Each year, from March through July, grunion lay eggs in the  sand on the beaches in Southern California, including many of the beaches in San Diego.</p>
<p>Grunion are fish that come ashore in California during particularly high  nighttime tides to reproduce and lay their eggs. The eggs develop out of water  while buried in the sand and hatch two weeks later when high tides enable the  baby grunion to reach the sea.</p>
<p>Dugan notes that beach wrack—or the piles of kelp and plant  and animal remains that are washed ashore by waves—are a valuable part of the  marine ecosystem, providing microhabitat for a variety of animals. Many of  these animals provide vital resources for shorebirds.</p>
<p>“While this may appear to beach visitors as unsightly  debris, wrack accumulates and breaks down as a result of natural processes,”  Dugan says. “Grooming removes or destroys the wrack and degrades the beach  habitat.” </p>
<h4>Cause for Concern</h4>
<p>In the late 1990s, conservationists and scientists began  expressing concerns that beach grooming could be harmful to birds and other  species that reproduce and forage on the coast. </p>
<p>Simmons and the San Diego beach maintenance staff agreed to  work with Martin to research the impact beach grooming had on the buried  grunion eggs and later with Dugan to study the recovery of the animals  dependent on beach wrack.</p>
<p>“You can’t ignore the public and various concerned groups,”  Simmons says. “We share the concerns with them and want to find balance. We  needed to find out what was happening.” </p>
<h4>Research Results</h4>
<p>Martin’s and Dugan’s research showed that aggressive  mechanized grooming removes significant amounts of wrack and sand, and disturbs  or destroys countless beach organisms, including grunion eggs.</p>
<p>Grooming also strips beaches of native plants and “embryo  dunes,” making the shoreline more vulnerable to erosion.</p>
<p>“Wrack is an important coastal resource,” says Dugan. “The  coastal ecosystem will benefit from changing or improving the management of  this particular resource.”</p>
<p>With the research in hand, Simmons began educating his staff  to recognize and avoid sensitive grunion breeding areas during spawning season  and validated the city’s practice of not grooming below the line of high tide.</p>
<h4>Coming Together </h4>
<p>Simmons began calling beach managers from around the state  to come together to talk about the research and how to improve beach-management  practices in general. </p>
<p>In 2004, Martin hosted the first meeting of beach managers  at Pepperdine University to discuss ecologically sound  management practices and to educate beach managers and state agencies about the  importance of protecting, restoring, and enhancing natural beach resources. </p>
<p>The working group for Beach Management in Ecologically  Sensitive Areas meets twice a year. The group is in the process of  incorporating as a nonprofit educational organization, the Beach Ecology  Coalition.</p>
<p>“We plan to examine some standard practices,” Martin says,  “and from those we can develop some options for best practices.”</p>
<p>For instance, during grunion season, almost all public  beaches across the state now only groom beaches following a protocol  distributed through the group, notes Jonna Engel, staff ecologist with the  California Coastal Commission. </p>
<p>“Nothing is groomed below the highest high-tide mark, which  is adjusted every two weeks to help the operators of the grooming tractors stay  higher on the shore than the recently deposited eggs,” she says.</p>
<h4>Alternative Approach</h4>
<p>Besides participating in the meetings of the beach managers  group, the California Coastal Commission has formed a beach grooming work  group.</p>
<p>The work group is looking at “several beach grooming  alternatives that are being discussed, promoted, and in several cases  implemented by cities through permit conditions,” Engel says. Cities and  counties are also being encouraged to voluntarily change their local coastal  plans to address beach grooming.</p>
<p>Alternatives being promoted, she says, include no grooming,  hand grooming, seasonal grooming, zonal or rotational grooming, and threshold  grooming, or wrack removal beyond a certain density or height. </p>
<h4>Changing Views</h4>
<p>To educate the public and beach managers about these alternative  practices and their benefits, the California Coastal Commission and the Beach  Ecology Coalition plan to create a statewide natural beach ecosystem awareness  campaign and to develop a statewide best beach management practices guide.</p>
<p>“We understand that the tourist draw is really important,  but we feel that with education we can perhaps change the public’s viewpoint on  what is a desirable beach,” Engel says. </p>
<p>Simmons also encourages other beach and coastal managers to  start a dialogue with those performing beach grooming in their state.</p>
<p>“It’s very important,” Simmons says. “The best way to  address issues is to first get them out on the table and talk about them.”</p>
