"RELIGIOUS EQUALITY AMENDMENTS" <br>

WRITTEN STATEMENT BY RAY GINGERICH<br>
<p>
I have been asked to testify to this body as a representative
of the Mennonite Church (specifically those Mennonite bodies
represented by the Mennonite Central Committee).[1]  But as with
most other religious groups, it is not easy for Mennonites to
address issues of controversy with one voice.  I have
therefore attempted to shape my testimony around critical
points of Mennonite heritage and identity held in common by
the Mennonite peoples.<p>

     The heritage of the Mennonites that emerged out of the
sixteenth-century Reformation is that of a persecuted minority
people-tortured on the wrack, drowned in the rivers, burned at
the stake, driven out of the land-oppression legitimized in
the name of God and the Christian church, legalized by the
civilized states of Western Europe.  Our Mennonite foreparents
came to this continent for land, for liberty, and for space to
practice love toward the neighbor.  Mennonites today continue
to be one of the many religious minorities of this beloved
country, the United States of America.  It is therefore
understandable that Mennonites cannot now maintain integrity
by aligning themselves with the majority religious position of
those controlling the legal instruments of the state when the
design of the majority position will quite clearly weaken the
voice of the minorities.  Thus, in finding ourselves in
opposition to the proposed "Religious Equality' Constitutional
Amendment, we defend our current interests.  But we do so
speaking out of our deep social, political, and theological
roots.<p>
     To pass an amendment would lower the safeguards of
religion from intrusion by the state and would allow greater
freedom (and added economic support) under the protective
umbrella of the state for those holding to the majority
religion.  This added freedom to practice religion in public schools and other public places-
whether on a national or local level-would de facto be freedom
for the majority while de facto denying this freedom to most
minority religious groups not in power.  This, as seen from
the perspective of the Mennonite heritage, is not a move
toward democracy but toward majority rule and majority
religion, not a nudge toward greater freedom and a deeper
national spirituality but a shift toward the potential for
religious tyranny.<p>

     Secondly, in the tradition of toleration and the search
for the dignity of the socially marginated, we wish also to
assist in the protection of religious freedom for other
minorities.  Mennonites are a people of the Book in the great
stream of the Judeo-Christian tradition whose master teaches
us to do unto others as we would have them do to us.  We do
not want other minorities, whatever their beliefs and
religious understandings may be, to be subjected to
denunciations of their religious beliefs in public schools or
other public places or to face proselytizing through prayers
or other religious activities in our public institutions. 
Such activities would most likely be sponsored and implemented
by those of the majority religion operating our public schools
and by government officials.  But once the current
constitutional protections from religion-by-the-state would be
removed, public schools could become targeted arenas for small
but zealous political-religious groups to promulgate ideas and
behavior destructive to public interest and order.<p>

     Third, Mennonites are a people of community-a people who
hold their daily acts and lifestyle to be expressions of their
faith as significant as their words and the creedal
statements.  We hold the home and church to be the
institutions of primary responsibility to inculcate and model
religious values, practices and behavior, not the public
schools.<p>

     Praying is a symbolic act in which the people and the
symbols surrounding us in prayer -are as important as the
words of the prayer itself.  Mennonites would prefer to have
their progeny associate the Lord's Prayer with a community of
faith gathered before the cross symbolizing the servanthood of
Jesus and the self-giving love of God.  To associate the
Christian faith with the nation's flag in a public school (or
elsewhere)-as the proponents of the proposed "Religious
Equality Amendment" are prone to do-is, within the theological
tradition of the Mennonites, seen as an idolatrous form of
civil religion.  Such religion, when practiced on a regular
basis in our public schools, inextricably confuses the
Christian faith with American nationalism in the developing
child's psyche (and even in that of the practicing adult).<p>

     Fourth, Mennonites are one of several denominations in
the United States who together are known as the "historic
peace churches." We claim a tradition in which the values and
the underlying assumptions of the community of faith are
distinct from those of the nation-state-at times even in
opposition.  We believe that in "living out' our faith there
are times when the Christian commitment to a nonviolent Christ
conflicts with the claims of sovereignty made by a nation-
state that has largely rejected the path of nonviolence.  We
believe that violence destroys justice and perpetuates greater
violence.<p>

     We fear that our beloved nation is rapidly becoming a
demonstration to the world of a society created by violence,
driven by violence,destroyed by violence-the violence of
economic greed, the politics of deceit and misinformation. 
All of this is happening while mainstream religion in America-
the religion of those groups most ardently lobbying for prayer
in schools and for placing restrictions on the First
Amendment-provides no critique of the fiandamental malady of
the nation-institutional, religiously sanctioned violence.<p>

     Under these circumstances, we cannot and dare not in the
name of God, or evangelical faith, or "family values," or a
renewing of national spirituality, pursue the goals of our
faith by sanctioning prayer in public schools (or in other
ways enabling the state to become more involved in religion)
and thus allowing this to become yet another layer of
religious deception sanctioning American violence.

[1]    The current statement is an individual member's attempt
to be representative of the Mennonite Church.  It should not
be viewed as a statement by the church.  Mennonites are a
congregationally-oriented people-church.  Statements of belief
and policy must not merely represent a broad spectrum of the
congregations, but must be officially adopted by the
congregations'delegates before they should be recognized as
statements by the Mennonite Church.
