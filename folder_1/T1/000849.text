      Ecologic and economic factors, as well as changes in human
      behavior, have resulted in the emergence of new and the
      reemergence of existing but forgotten infectious diseases
      during the past 20 years. Flea-borne disease organisms, e.g.,
      (Yersinia pestis, Rickettsia typhi, R. felis, and Bartonella
      henselae) are widely distributed throughout the world in
      endemic-disease foci, where components of the enzootic cycle
      are present. However, flea-borne diseases could reemerge in
      epidemic form because of changes in vector-host ecology due to
      environmental and human behavior modification. The changing
      ecology of murine typhus in southern California and Texas over
      the past 30 years is a good example of urban and suburban
      expansion affecting infectious disease outbreaks. In these
      areas, the classic rat-flea-rat cycle of R. typhi has been
      replaced by a peridomestic animal cycle involving, e.g.,
      free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums and their fleas. In
      addition to the vector-host components of the murine typhus
      cycle, we have uncovered a second typhuslike rickettsia, R.
      felis. This agent was identified from the blood of a
      hospitalized febrile patient and from opossums and their fleas.
      We reviewed the ecology of R. typhi and R. felis and present
      recent data relevant to the vector biology, immunology, and
      molecular characterization and phylogeny of flea-borne
      rickettsioses.

A complex matrix of ecologic and economic factors and human behavior
changes has resulted in the emergence of new infectious diseases during the
past 20 years. Ecologic changes lead to the emergence of both known and as
yet unknown pathogens circulating in the complex host and vector systems of
undisturbed habitats. A drastic increase of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in
the late 1970s, Lyme disease in the early 1980s, and ehrlichioses in the
1990s in the United States attests to the strong correlation of these
diseases to human-made ecologic changes and further illustrates the
inability of existing monitoring systems to predict outbreaks and protect
at-risk populations. Unmanaged growth and expansion of the suburbs into
undisturbed habitats have generated ideal ecosystems for many displaced
animals. The changing ecology of murine typhus in southern California and
Texas over the past 30 years is a good example of suburban expansion and
environmental modifications affecting infectious disease outbreaks. In
suburban areas, vector fleas are most often associated with human
habitation through their natural hosts, e.g., commensal rodents and
peridomestic animals, such as free-ranging cats and dogs, opossums,
raccoons, and squirrels. Fleas commonly found on these animals are picked
up by household pets and brought into homes. These fleas, apart from being
a nuisance, may carry pathogenic organisms of concern to human health.

Of the 2,000 species and subspecies of fleas, only a handful serve as
vectors of human diseases. Several bacterial pathogens of public health
importance are maintained and transmitted by fleas, among them, Yersinia
pestis, the causative agent of plague (known in history as black death).
Flea-borne human pathogens are maintained in a zoonotic cycle involving
mammalian hosts and fleas. They seldom cause overt disease in their natural
hosts but commonly result in clinical disease, e.g., plague, murine typhus,
and cat-scratch disease, in humans. The rapid spread of pathogens to human
populations is due to the frequent feeding behavior and extraordinary
mobility of fleas. Flea-borne diseases are widely distributed throughout
the world, in the form of endemic foci, where components of the cycle are
present; however, these diseases become epidemic in human populations when
infected mammalian hosts die and their fleas leave in search of a
bloodmeal. Of flea-borne bacterial pathogens (e.g., Y. pestis, Rickettsia
typhi, R. felis, and Bartonella henselae), the most studied and reviewed is
Y. pestis. In this article, however, we want to examine the agents of
flea-borne rickettsioses, namely R. typhi and the newly identified R.
felis. Beginning with R. typhi ecology, we will review and discuss recent
data relevant to the ecology, vector biology, immunologic and molecular
characterization, and phylogeny of the flea-borne rickettsiae.

Natural History of Flea-borne Rickettsioses

"Murine typhus is a good example of a disease whose importance is not
adequately appreciated except by the patient, and, even today, in most
parts of the world, he will never know what ails him because the diagnosis
will not be made" (1). Murine typhus is one of the most widely distributed
arthropod-borne infections endemic in many coastal areas and ports
throughout the world. It occurs in epidemics or with high prevalence; is
often unrecognized and substantially underreported; and, although it can be
clinically mild, it can also cause severe illness and death (2,3). The
severity of murine typhus infection has been associated with old age,
delayed diagnosis, hepatic and renal dysfunction, central nervous system
abnormalities, and pulmonary compromise. Death occurs in up to 4% of
hospitalized patients (3). Thousands of human cases were reported annually
in the United States (1,2). Outbreaks have been reported in Australia and
recently in China, Greece, Israel, Kuwait, and Thailand (1,2,4). Recent
serosurveys have demonstrated high prevalence of antityphus group (TG)
rickettsiae in Asia and southern Europe (4). Despite the current level of
reported human cases in the United States of fewer than 100 per year,
murine typhus has been the subject of several recent studies (3,4).
Rekindled interest in this disease is partially a result of field data and
epidemiologic surveys, which have prompted a reconsideration of established
components of the vector-reservoir cycle and their interaction with humans
(5-7). The classic cycle of R. typhi, the etiologic agent of murine typhus,
involves rats (Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus) and the rat flea,
Xensopsylla cheopis (Figure 1). The flea has been considered the main
vector, and the disease is transmitted by flea bites or contact with
rickettsia-containing feces and tissues during or after blood feeding.
Although the rat-flea-rat cycle is still the major route of human infection
throughout the world, murine typhus exists in some endemic-disease foci
where both rats and rat fleas are absent.

Reported cases of murine are focused largely in central and south central
Texas and the Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California; however, infected
rats and their fleas are hard to document in these areas (5-7). Thirty-three cases
of locally acquired murine typhus in Los Angeles County have been
associated with seropositive domestic cats and opossums (7). More than 16
(40%) of 38 opossums and nine (90%) of 10 domestic cats collected from the
case areas were seropositive for R. typhi antibodies. No seropositive cats
(n=21) or opossums (n=36) were found in the control areas. Although flea
infection was not investigated, opossums were the most heavily infested
with the cat flea, Ctencephalides felis (104.7/animal). C. felis was also
the most prevalent flea species (97%) collected from opossums, cats, and
dogs (but not rats) in southern Texas. Surveys in other areas of the
country (7,8) had similar results, which further minimizes the role of rat
fleas in the maintenance of endemic typhus within the United States. The
maintenance of R. typhi in the cat flea/opossum cycle (Figure 1) is,
therefore, of potential public health importance since C. felis is a
widespread pest that avidly bites humans (1,3,8-11).

During the past 3 years, we have investigated a new typhuslike rickettsia
(initially designated as ELB and later named R. felis) identified in cat
fleas and opossums from California and Texas murine typhus foci (8-12).
Both R. typhi and R. felis were found in fleas and in opossum tissues
(8-11). Additionally, a retrospective investigation of five murine typhus
patients from Texas subsequently demonstrated that four patients were
infected with R. typhi and a fifth had been infected with R. felis (8).
Observation of human infection by R. felis underscores the usefulness of
molecular techniques for diagnosing closely related rickettsial species.
Furthermore, this documented human infection with R. felis and its presence
in opossums and their fleas and possibly other wildlife associated with
human habitation have raised concerns about the extent of R. felis
spillover into human populations.

The Role of Household Pets and Peridomestic Animals and Their Fleas in the
Maintenance of R. typhi and R. felis

Murine typhus field surveys in southern California indicated the presence
of TG antibodies in opossums, striped skunks, rats, and resident cats but
not in 11 other species of native mammals (5,7). The seropositive animals
were associated with human cases and were heavily infested with C. felis
fleas. Furthermore, the isolation of R. typhi from opossums and their fleas
led these investigators to regard opossums as of epidemiologic
significance. The presence of R. felis in cat fleas collected from opossums
within the Los Angeles murine typhus focus stimulated further interest
(8,10). To understand the potential role of the R. felis and nonrat hosts
in the biology of endemic typhus, we examined the samples collected in
southern Texas, a region accounting for approximately one-third of the
current reported murine typhus cases in the United States. Restriction
digests of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from 399 cat fleas
collected from nine opossums had an infection rate of 3.8% for R. felis and
0.8% for R. typhi. Three of nine tested opossums were infected with R.
felis (8,10). No R. typhi-infected rats (R. norvegicus) or rat fleas (X.
cheopis) were found in surveyed samples. The persistence of murine typhus
in both geographic foci appears to be better accounted for by infected cat
fleas, opossums, and other nonrat hosts found near human populations
(Figure 1, Table 1). The presence of both R. typhi and R. felis by
PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in opossums from murine
typhus foci in southern California and Texas thus confirms the possible
role of this marsupial in the maintenance of murine typhus infection.
However, our attempt to isolate either R. felis or R. typhi from
PCR-positive opossum blood or spleen collected in North Carolina, Texas,
and California proved unsuccessful. Although isolating rickettsiae from
blood samples has proved difficult, nevertheless, our data, as well as
published information, support the role of opossums in maintaining these
rickettsiae and infecting fleas.

(superscript a)The procedure for detecting R. typhi and R. felis in fleas followed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will now focus on the role of household pets, primarily cats, in the
transmission of R. typhi/R. felis. Experimental infection of cats with R.
typhi produces a subclinical infection with rapid recovery and
seroconversion (1). Cats that were used to maintain commercial cat flea
colonies displayed high antibody titers to TG rickettsiae. In addition, the
report by Sorvillo et al. (7) that 90% of resident cats had demonstrable
anti-TG immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) titers prompted us to
extend our seroprevalence studies to household pets to determine the role
of resident and feral cats in the urban and suburban foci of murine typhus.
We accomplished this through collaboration with several veterinary schools
and private practice veterinarians. For the northeast U.S. cohort, 143 cat
serum samples were assayed. The sources of the samples were private
practice veterinarians in the northeast United States (Michigan, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin), who had
submitted them to the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine,
Clinical Microbiology laboratory, for testing for common feline pathogens
(e.g., feline infectious peritonitis virus and feline leukemia virus). For
the North Carolina cohort, 513 serum samples were tested. These were banked
samples, originally collected from native cats, for use in a study of B.
henselae seroprevalence (E.B. Breitschwerdt et al., unpub. data). IFA was
used to screen cat sera for reactivity against R. typhi (Wilmington strain)
at a 1/64 dilution. Because of the serologic cross-reactivity between R.
typhi and R. felis, we have performed the definitive epitope blocking
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DEB-ELISA) using monoclonal anti-R.
typhi 120 kDa surface protein antigen to rule out seropositivity to R.
typhi. DEB-ELISA was performed on samples with an IFA titer of 1/64 (n=31
for northeast U.S. cats, n=49 for North Carolina cats) (13). For the
northeast U.S. cohort, 143 samples were t
ested by IFA and 31 (21%) were
seropositive. When these 31 positive samples were subjected to DEB-ELISA, 8
(25%) were positive, i.e., reactivity was not directed against R. typhi. Of
513 North Carolina cohort serum samples tested by IFA, 93 (18.1%) were
seropositive at 1:64, and 49 were immunoreactive against an organism(s)
other than R. typhi. Lack of R. felis monoclonal antibodies limited the
usefulness of the DEB-ELISA in determining the source of infection in cats
with high antibody titer against TG rickettsiae. Similar problems have been
encountered in attempting to serologically identify the rickettsial species
contributing to an unexplained febrile illness of dogs in the southern
United States (14). Because of the antigenic cross-reactivity among the TG
rickettsiae (R. prowazekii, R. typhi, and R. canada), and between the TG
rickettsiae, R. felis, and R. bellii, serologic tests should be
complemented by PCR/RFLP and/or direct isolation of rickettsiae by tissue
culture.

A combination of IFA and DEB-ELISA used in our serosurvey represents the
first attempt to define seroreactivity to TG rickettsiae among resident and
feral cats. The positivity rate for these samples was unexpectedly high
(18% to 21%), even though the sources of the samples were sick, febrile
cats. The public health implications of these data are unclear. It is
estimated that approximately one third of U.S. households have a pet cat;
this translates into 57 million animals. If we conservatively estimate that
only 5% of these animals have a patent rickettsial infection, 285,000 cats
are possibly infected with a life-threatening zoonosis. Despite the
serologic evidence presented above, the question of whether cats can serve
as a reservoir host for R. typhi and R. felis and a source of infection for
fleas remains to be elucidated.

R. typhi and R. felis Infection in Fleas

Cat fleas from eight commercial colonies in various regions of the United
States were infected with R. felis (11). The infection rates as determined
by selective PCR amplification and subsequent restriction digest analysis
and Southern hybridization of PCR products were 43% to 93%. These flea
colonies were initiated either with fleas from one supplier, in which R.
felis was first identified (15), or with fleas from stray cats and dogs
(11). In light of the latter study (11), we recently received
alcohol-preserved flea samples from L. Durden (Georgia Southern
University), collected from opossums, dogs, and a bobcat in Statesboro,
Georgia, and Nashville, Tennessee, between 1986 and 1996. After PCR/RFLP
and partial sequencing of selected PCR products, we found that more than
50% of the cat fleas obtained from the vertebrate hosts were infected with
R. felis. However, none of the other flea species collected from the same
hosts were infected (Table 1). Although R. felis has been detected in cat
fleas from nine states (California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New York,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas), it is probably more
widespread than current data indicate. These findings demonstrate the wide
distribution of R. felis in suburban habitats where opossums enter human
habitations and share fleas with domestic dogs and cats.

Naperville, IL), sectioned (4-6 m)(16), and

Experimental infections of various laboratory colonies of fleas, e.g., X.
cheopis, Leptopsylla segnis, and C. felis, have demonstrated a similarity
in the acquisition, propagation, dissemination, and transmission of R.
typhi (2,16). Infection in the flea is initiated when the rickettsiae,
ingested in a bloodmeal, enter the midgut epithelial cells. Three to four
days after infection, rickettsiae can be detected in only a small group of
midgut epithelial cells (Figure 2A). Over the next 3 to 5 days, rickettsial
numbers increase exponentially and spread from the initial sites of
infection to the entire midgut epithelial linings. Ten days must elapse
before the infected fleas can transmit R. typhi to susceptible hosts
through infectious feces. The dynamics of R. felis infection have not been
studied in detail experimentally, but earlier electron microscopy using
infected fleas demonstrates the presence of this rickettsia in gut
epithelial linings, tracheal matrix, muscle, ovaries, and epithelial sheath
of the testes (15). The high rates of infection in laboratory colonies of
fleas and the presence of R. felis in their eggs and newly emerged
nonblood-fed specimens indicate that the maintenance of this rickettsiosis
occurs by transovarial transmission. However, fleas may acquire both R.
typhi and R. felis from rickettsemic hosts and then pass on the infection
to their progeny by transovarial transmission. Neither R. typhi nor R.
felis infection is lethal to fleas. There is no evidence that massive
infection of flea midgut (Figure 2B) affects the feeding behavior and
survival of the infected fleas. In contrast, X. cheopis fleas infected with
Y. pestis starve to death while the human body lice infected with R.
prowazekii die of the infection within 2 weeks (17). Neither Y. pestis nor
R. prowazekii is maintained transovarially, and in contrast to
rickettsia-infected fleas, persistence of these organisms requires constant
host turnover to allow the infection cycle to perpetuate in nature. The
rickettsial relationship with their arthropod hosts is considered
symbiotic, yet in other instances, they act as true parasites; e.g.,
members of the Rickettsia and Wolbachia alter reproduction and manipulate
cellular processes in their hosts (18).

Calculations based on the quantity of rickettsiae in the blood of a
rickettsemic rat and the minute volume of blood ingested by fleas indicate
that the invasion of flea midgut epithelium by R. typhi is extremely
efficient, requiring only a few rickettsial organisms to result in
infection (19). During the rickettsemic period in the vertebrate host, R.
typhi is found only in the cellular portion of the blood, particularly
leukocytes. These blood cells are destroyed very rapidly (ca. 6 hours)
within the flea gut (19). Experimental studies demonstrate that the
rickettsial infection of flea midgut epithelium is facilitated by the
flea's digestive processes. Presumably, the rapid liquefaction of the blood
liberates intracellular rickettsiae from within infected blood cells. Since
no peritrophic membrane is formed around the bloodmeal, there is no
physical barrier to prevent freed rickettsiae from contacting and entering
flea midgut epithelium. Therefore, the rapid breakdown in the cellular
integrity of blood components within the flea gut lumen is probably an
essential feature of the rickettsial infection of fleas. However, the
biologic aspects of rickettsia-vector interactions has lagged behind other
vector-borne disease studies, and only a few of the underlying phenomena
involved in rickettsia-vector interactions have been partially elucidated.

Antigenic Characterization and Phylogeny of R. felis

The isolation of R. felis from cat flea homogenates after sequential
passage from infected rat spleens through embryonated chicken eggs (20)
allowed its further characterization. The identity of R. felis in tissue
samples and fleas was achieved by a combination of PCR/RFLP (with primers
based on the 17 and 120 kDa antigens, citrate synthase, and 16S rRNA gene
sequences) (Figure 3), the lack of rOmpA, and seroreactivity with
monospecific sera and monoclonal antibodies (Table 2,3). Furthermore, R.
felis grown in culture more strongly resembles TG than spotted fever group
rickettsiae in its morphology by light microscopy, growth pattern in Vero
cells, and delayed formation of small plaques (20). Immunologic
characterization of R. felis by a battery of monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies showed various degrees of reactivity with TG group and in
particular R. typhi (Table 2). The T65-1 monoclonal antibody that
recognizes 120 kDa surface protein of R. typhi, but not R. prowazekii or R.
canada, reacts weakly with R. felis. Spotted fever group polyclonal or
monoclonal antibodies also exhibited lower reactivity with R. felis. The
SDS-PAGE profile obtained for R. felis here clearly resembled that of R.
typhi and R. akari, lacking the prominent larger rOmpA protein found in
spotted fever group rickettsiae and R. canada (Figure 4; 21). Immunoblot
studies (20) using anti-R. felis polyclonal antibodies further demonstrate
a strong cross-reactivity with R. typhi lipopolysaccharides but not spotted
fever group rickettsiae.

The initial R. felis characterization of the sequence of a portion of the
17 kDa gene and its reactivity with anti-R. typhi polyclonal and monoclonal
antibodies suggested resemblance to typhus rickettsiae
(Table 3; 20). However, its 16S rRNA sequence more closely
 resembled those of R. akari and R. australis, a distinct clade 
of the spotted fever group (22,23). PCR amplification with rOmpA 
primers Rr.190.70p and Rr.190.602n was unsuccessful with R. felis (21). This result is perhaps not surprising since these primers also do not amplify DNA
from typhus rickettsiae, R. akari, or R. australis (22,23). Recently,
Andersson et al (24) reported the presence of rOmpA gene sequences in 
R. prowazekii genome, even though there  is no evidence that the 190kDa
protein is expressed in TG rickettsiae.

 Consensus parsimony
 cladogram of rickettsial 16S
 ribosomal RNA sequences shows that
 R. felis (in bold) is a member of
 the spotted fever group.

For phylogenetic studies, nucleotide sequences of all known rickettsial
Citrate synthases, 17kDa surface antigen genes, and 16S r RNA sequences
were obtained from Genbank and initially aligned by PILEUP (Genetics
Computer Group, Madison WI) according to the progressive alignment
algorithm of Feng and Doolittle (25). Nonoverlapping sequences at the
trailing ends of the resulting multiple sequence file were removed and the
sequences were realigned by PILEUP to give the final multiple sequence
file. A distance matrix for all sequences was calculated by DNADIST, with
differences between transition and transversion rates corrected according
to Kimura's method (26). Evolutionary trees were computed by DNAPARS
using parsimony, with the number of changes of base needed on a given tree
calculated according to Fitch (27). Bootstrap analysis was performed on a
100x resampled set using SEQBOOT, with a 100x randomized input order, and
the consensus tree topology was calculated by CONSENSE. The resulting
cladograms for 16S rRNA and citrate synthase positioned R. felis within the
same clade as R. akari, R. australis, and R. helvetica, and identified it
as belonging to the spotted fever group of rickettsiae (22,23). The
consensus tree for 16S rRNA is illustrated in Figure 5. The branching order
within the clade comprising R. felis, R. helvetica, R. australis, and R.
akari altered between different parsimony trees; however, the overall
association was relatively stable. The sequence information from 17 kDa
protein antigen, rOmpA, 16S rRNA, and citrate synthase genes places R.
felis intermediate to the typhus and spotted fever group rickettsiae. The
typhus and spotted fever group dichotomy, however, does not adequately
reflect the evolutionary history of R. akari, R. felis, or R. australis.

Future Perspectives of Typhus Infections

Traditionally TG rickettsiae have been defined by antigenic characteristics
of their lipopolysaccharides (4), but no fine line separates them from
spotted fever group rickettsiae.
 Similarly the classification of
rickettsiae on the basis of molecular and immunologic characterizations is
also problematic because of high sequence homology and serologic
crossreactivity within and between the members of TG and spotted fever
group. Distinct biologic differences, however, occur between TG and SFG
rickettsiae with regard to arthropod vectors, in vitro growth, antigenic
repertoire, pathologic features, and clinical manifestations. Although the
diagnosis can be made serologically and confirmed clinically for most of
the pathogenic rickettsiae, it is unlikely to serologically distinguish R.
felis from R. typhi infections. The extent of human infections with R.
felis is unknown at this time, and the disease needs to be studied
clinically. The detection and identification of R. felis in a single human
case has been carried out by PCR/RFLP and Southern hybridization (8). 
The detection of both R. typhi and R. felis presents a difficult diagnostic
challenge since prompt diagnosis of murine typhus or infections with R.
felis can be established only when rickettsiae or rickettsia-PCR products
from blood samples are directly isolated. DEB-ELISA using monoclonal
antibodies specific to either R. typhi or R. felis would be a useful tool
to differentiate between these rickettsiae and closely related species.

Reported cases of murine typhus in the United States are largely focused in
central and southcentral Texas and Los Angeles and Orange Counties in
California. However, murine typhus-infected rats and rat fleas are hard to
document within these foci, which suggests the maintenance of R. typhi in
the cat flea/opossum cycle. Destruction and reduction of natural habitats
displace many animals and force them to move into the hospitable
environments of the suburbs and cities and subsequently increase the
potential for "old and new pathogens" to reemerge and generate new
outbreaks. The current distribution of the opossum in more than 40 states
in the United States and the invasion of urban and suburban habitats by
this opportunistic marsupial have also been aided by human activities.
Opossums, free-ranging cats, and rats in urban and suburban habitats,
where food and hospitable environments are plentiful, may live their entire
lives in the same backyards. Therefore, their potential role in the murine
typhus cycle as hosts to both R. typhi, R. felis, and their fleas warrants further
investigation.
