    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer consists of National Wilderness Preservation System areas
        of 640 acres or more, in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.
        Virgin Islands.  The map layer was created by extracting these
        wilderness areas from the National Atlas map layer: Federal Lands of the
        United States.  This is a replacement for the December 2005 map layer.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale
        data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United
        States in the use of these data.

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      Using ESRI's ArcInfo GIS software, the map layer was checked for label
      errors, dangling nodes, and intersections.  Polygon topology was built
      for the map layer.
    Completeness_Report:
      This map layer includes National Wilderness Preservation System areas for
      all fifty of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and
      the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Included are features of 640 acres (one square
      mile) or more.  Generally, features under this size are not shown.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Wilderness areas were extracted from the National Atlas Federal Lands
          of the United States map layer.  Attributes for feature type, feature
          name, agency ownership, URL, State, and State FIPS codes were
          retained.  Adjacent wilderness areas having the same feature type and
          name, agency ownership, and URL were merged.  State attributes of the
          merged wilderness areas were then updated.  Label points were created
          for polygons having no label points; they were then assigned a
          Non-Wilderness value.

          name, file path, and the page's file name.  A URL in this map layer is
          usually the address of a Federal agency website.  For example,
          <http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&wname=Unimak>
          is the address of a page that describes the Unimak Wilderness.
