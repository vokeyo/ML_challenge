<p> In coastal Louisiana, no event has such immediate and widespread economic, 
    human, and ecological effect as a tropical weather system. The high winds, 
    extreme rain, storm surge, and flooding may damage infrastructure, disrupt 
    and destroy lives, and impact the natural environment. There is a well developed 
    and understood emergency system in place for rapid assessment of storm impacts 
    on the human population and infrastructure (i.e., FEMA). A similar system 
  has not yet emerged for assessing the effects on the biota.</p>
<p>Researchers at National Wetlands Research Center (NWRC) have been monitoring 
    the barrier islands of the Gulf of Mexico coast for almost two decades. Scientific 
    studies of biological processes related to aspects of the barrier islands 
    have been an important part of research activities. Additionally, we have 
    produced numerous seagrass and terrestrial maps over the years allowing habitat 
  trends to be followed at a very detailed </p>
<p>scale in space and time. Finally, we have an active aircraft observation 
  methodology that allows rapid </p>
<p>qualitative and quantitative assessment of marsh and barrier island impacts 
    of various human-caused and naturally occurring events. We have data from 
    13 flights conducted from September 1998 to present; from those data we can 
  document changes in shoreline characteristics and island integrity.</p>

<p>The first line of defense that may weaken a tropical storm is a barrier island 
    system. Those islands are also usually the least resistant lands to the full 
    force of violent weather. The use of low-altitude aircraft observations has 
    allowed NWRC staff scientists to quickly respond to major events, informing 
    policymakers and public land managers of major storm effects on the natural 
  environment. </p>

    <td valign="top">The lighthouse was situated on land until Hurricane Georges 
        (September 28, 1998). After that the island had eroded from under the 
        lighthouse such that the lighthouse appeared to be in open water. Since 
        Georges, although the island had reformed behind the lighthouse, the lighthouse 
        remained in open water. The pre-Ivan photo (August 11, 2004) shows the 
        lighthouse in open water about 30 m from the shoreline, and the northern 
        tip of the island was relatively broad and extended several hundred meters 
        north of the lighthouse. Note in the background, beyond the lighthouse, 
        two large vegetated islands (1, 2), connected by beach, then an overwash 
        channel that still had not closed up since Hurricane Lili. That channel 
        is one of the seven overwash channels that were still open in our pre-storm 
        survey (<a href="chan_graph_post_ivan.htm">see graph</a>). Beyond the 
        aforementioned overwash channel, one can see two small vegetated islands 
      (3, 4) followed by a larger island (5).</td>
    <td valign="top">Note that the land behind the lighthouse has completely 
        washed away, and the first of the two large vegetated islands that were 
        beyond the lighthouse has disappeared as well. Consequently, the closest 
        vegetated island south of the lighthouse is now what was the second large 
        island (2) before the storm. Beyond that island one can see the two smaller 
        vegetated islands (3, 4) followed by the larger island (5), as in the 
        previous photo. Note that the water behind the lighthouse has no whitecaps 
        or breaking waves, which indicates an absence of shallow shoals. Such 
        shoaling was evident immediately after Hurricane Georges. It was probably 
        the cumulative effect of four hurricanes in 7 years that resulted in the 
        deep erosion (evidenced by lack of shoaling) seen now after Hurricane 
      Ivan.<br /></td>

        Seagrass beds can be seen in the foreground, though some are not visible

        25% of the beds were buried during Hurricane Camille). Increased turbidity

        The marsh and mangroves seem unaffected at this time, though latent effects

        well inland of their normal foraging area. Note several areas of floating

        alterniflora</em> and <em>Phragmites australis</em>) that was probably
