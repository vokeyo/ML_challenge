Since I missed out on the Thanksgiving trip, due to my 
<A href="http://annwm.lbl.gov/~leggett/pictures/yosemite_10-25-03">bum knee</a>
I had to make up for it by staying in Joshua tree twice as long as
everybody else. There were two waves of participants this year -
Daniel, Tina and I drove down on the 24, and they stayed 'till
the 29th. The second wave, consisting of Jack, John and Michelle, Matt
and Susan, Joel and Linda, and Dan and Lynsey, started showing up 
late on the 28th, and slowly trickled in over the next few days, 
staying until the 2nd or 3rd.<p>

For the second year in a row, Tina, Daniel and I made the long
trek on Christmas eve, and had dinner at the Domino's in
Yucca Valley. This time though we were much more comfortable in
my Subaru, as I had invested in a large Thule roof box last time
they were on sale at REI. It made the car handle like a whale 
(especially with three large people, lots of gear, and 15 gallons
of water), but it was a spacious whale.<p>

Daniel's friends Jim and Brenda had gotten us a site, so we
didn't have any problems camping that evening. It was surprisingly
pleasant, temperature wise, but the temp dropped like a stone 
in the middle of the night, and we awoke to frozen water bottles.<p>

<font size=4><b>Thursday Dec 25 - Old Woman</b></font><p>

The day started off partially overcast, but we were game to get on
the rock, so we put up with the cold and walked over to the Old Woman.
We ran up <b><A href="../db/main.shtml#toe jam">Toe Jam</A></b> (5.7),
the moved over a few feet where I led
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#bearded cabbage">Bearded Cabbage</A></b> (5.10c).
Had a bit of a problem at the crux, where one moves from the rail to
the crack - Toe Jam was an insufficient warmup for that big move.
Daniel and Tina followed it, as well as Jim and Tony who had joined us.
After going up it a second time, we moved back to the camp site, where
Daniel led 
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#pinched rib">Pinched Rib</A></b> (5.10b). A
one move wonder, but still fun. </table><p>

As we were finishing off, we started to
feel the pitter patter of rain and the wind began to pick up. Jim had
rigged a huge tarp against the rock, and we huddled in there as the
skied opened up. The deluge was upon us, and torrential rain compounded
by fierce gusting winds battered us. Neither Tina nor Daniel had brought
any wet weather gear, and proceeded to get totally soaked. We cooked a
hasty dinner under the tarp, then retreated to the tents. I have never
seen a desert storm as intense as this one - huge rivulets of water
chewed fresh arroyos in the sand, with rivers 2 feet deep washing
over the roads and paths. Many people made the mistake of pitching
tents in runoff channels, and ended up completely soaked - I was
fortunate to have pitched my tent in an area with good drainage,
and so managed to avoid this calamity. Many people got up in the
middle of the night and headed for a motel to dry out.

Friday dawned bright and sunny. We picked up from the horror show of
the night before, ate a big breakfast, and waited for the temperature
to climb to more reasonable levels. When it did, we made for Echo Rocks,
where Daniel led us off on 
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#pope's crack">Pope's Crack</A></b> (5.9).
A true J-tree classic. We then TRed
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#british airways">British Airways</A></b> (5.11d),
which really didn't feel 11d-ish. Though there's a small crack there,
it's really a face climb. Definitely a TR problem - protection is thin
to none, though there's a bolt 40 feet up. I wanted to try Rule Britannia,
which was right next to it, but there was a party on it, so instead I
led 
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#raked over the coles">Raked Over The Coles</A></b>
(5.10d). 
This problem has a really hard start - I ended up using the crack to
the left to make the first few moves, then moved back in. The rest
is fairly moderate, but sustained in spots.

We still had some daylight left, so we walked around the corner where
Daniel led
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#stick to what">Stick To What</A></b> (5.9),
a rather fun slab climb. I tried following it wearing my Mad Rocks, but
to my amazement, found that they had gotten slick as snot in the cold.
I couldn't smear worth a damn, and had to position each foot precisely
on an edge if I wanted it to stay put. Very odd - those shoes are
usually very sticky in warmer weather.<p>

We headed back to camp, and cooked up a big tasty dinner of pork loin
that had been marinating in something for a while. Jim and Brenda had
also made some sushi, which brought back memories of last year when
we froze our fingers making sushi for dinner on Christmas day.<p>

For a long time, Daniel had been telling me stories of night-time
romps through the Chasm, the cave system underneath the boulders
in the Real Hidden Valley. Apparently it was a tradition for Jim
and his crew to go through it on New Year's Eve, in pitch black
with no headlamps. Experienced guides were needed, but Jim had been
doing it for 18 year, which is a pretty healthy dose of experience.
It was decided to do a test run, so Jim led off with Tina, Daniel,
Susie, Linda and I following, and Joel, another old pro, bringing
up in the rear. Unfortunately, Jim was trashed, and Joel was 
totally wasted, so much badness ensued. First they couldn't find
the Gateway - Joel was insisting that someone had moved the
boulders. Then Jim got lost inside, and one of the girls started
freaking out. In the end, for the first time in the history of
the Chasm run, we had to turn headlamps on to make a quick exit.
Truly a night that will live in infamy. Especially when google
indexes this page....<p>


<font size=4><b>Saturday Dec 27 - The Techulator </b></font><p>
<pre>
Spire Route 5.5
Nameless 5.9
Muffin Bandits 5.10b
</pre>

A friend of Tina stopped by for the day, and a group of us went
out to the Techulator in the Wonderland of Rocks. We hiked in from
the west side, starting at the Key's Corner Parking area, and walked
for a couple of miles. The day was bright and sunny, though still
on the cold side. Tony set up a TR on the
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#spire route">Spire Route</A></b> (5.5),
and the crew played on that for a while. We then set up a TR on a
crack system that ran up the face of the Techulator, but isn't
in the book. The rock was a bit loose, so we decided against
leading it. I went up it, and tried a few variations, figuring it
to be about 5.9.<p>

Meanwhile, I was waiting for the sun to hit the dihedral where
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#muffin bandits">Muffin Bandits</A></b> (5.10b)
was hiding. It took a long time, but finally was exposed. This climb
starts off in a squeeze chimney for a few feet, then there are some
exposed face moves with your last pro a good bit below. The next
good hold is an exposed horn, and I was very dubious of its quality
considering how many other bits of the rock had broken off while
I was yarding on them. I really didn't want to make a dynamic move
to it, as if it were to come off I would deck about 25 feet below.
I spent a long time trying to figure out a static sequence until I
finally came across one involving a crimpy sidepull and a big high
step. The horn was pretty good, so I slung it and kept on going.
The dihedral itself was fairly nice, somewhat reminiscent of 
the Red Dihedral on the Incredible hulk in fact. The route was
finished off with a squirming roof move around a big boulder.
Fairly fun. Daniel followed, and ripped off a bunch of holds as
he was climbing. Finally, Tina's friend (whose name I've forgotten -
help please), made an attempt on it. He's a gym climber, and this 
was his first time on a real crack. We coached him through the
jams, but it still took him a huge amount of effort before he
finally made it to the top. He said he enjoyed the process though,
so maybe we have a new convert here.</table><p>

<table width=80%><tr><td>
It was getting dark by then, so I walked off the back side to
try to round up Tony and Linda who had gone off to try an 11
somewhere around the corner. The descent involved a 15 foot high,
fairly wide chimney. I was down on the ground when it came to
Daniel's turn, and he had trouble finding the descent - he wouldn't
believe that the chimney was the way down. I finally convinced him, 
and he made short work of it. We made it back to the car just
as the temperature really started to plummet.<p>

That night, Daniel and Tina announced to the rest of us that they
had gotten engaged. Jim got on a large boulder and reported this to
the rest of Hidden Valley campground at the top of his voice, and much
cheering was heard. Daniel kept on trying to find a romantic time
to do so, but bad weather or other circumstances kept on getting
in the way. So he did it when they were in their tent. Well, Joshua
Tree is a pretty romantic place in general, so no worries. We all
wish them the best of luck.</table><p>

Ever since watching Aaron and Matt work on
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#more monkey than funky">More Monkey Than Funky</A></b> (5.11c)
last year, I had wanted to try it. Who wouldn't be seduced by a downward
sloping 20ft roof crack followed by an 11c finger crack? So Daniel,
Tina and I headed out there, and I worked it with the standard 2 rope
technique. My first attempt on lead was a flail fest, and I took willy
nilly. It was a beautiful, sunny day - by far the best weather so far.
I was soon climbing without a shirt, risking a nice sunburn on my exposed
back. I then set up a TR and Daniel then had a go at it. Despite his enormous
strength, he has his mass playing against him. But eventually he made
it around and up, loosing only moderate amounts of skin in the process.
Tina also had a try, but was unable to stick the roof. I think it's
more a matter of core strength for her. I then had another go at it,
and did a much better job.</table><p>

Working that route took us quite a while, so instead of heading back
into the Barker Dam area as we had originally planned, we returned
to Echo Rocks where I sent Daniel up
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#heart and sole">Heart and Sole</A></b> (5.10a).
This starts as slab route for 3 bolts, then moves into a thin finger
crack in a right facing dihedral. The crux is definitely the bottom
slab section. Daniel was a little sketched and was cursing me, but
made it up with only a few bobbles. I followed, and figured out some
key beta, so after Tina tried it, I made Daniel go back up so he could
work it on TR and work on his technique. This time he was much more
confident.<p>

Time and daylight was running out, so we did a quick TR on 
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#falcon and the snowman">The Falcon and the 
Snowman</A></b> (5.10b), 
just to the left, which spared me the horror of having to lead it. Pure
slab all the way, with the odd micro crimp thrown in from time to time.
It's well bolted though - or at least all the cruxes are just after
a bolt, even if they are widely spaced.<p>

Jack showed up at the campground later that afternoon. He had been in
LA doing the family thing for a few days, and was eager do shred some
skin on the coarse granite crystals of the park. He brought a truly
hedonistic device with him - a catalytic propane heater for his tent.
We all made fun of him for it, but inside were seething with jealousy.

<font size=4><b>Monday Dec 29 - Hidden Valley Campground</b></font><p>

Toe Jam 5.7
Bearded Cabbage 5.10c
Double Cross 5.7
</pre>

Unfortunately, when the sun rose, it did so behind many clouds. We
kept on hoping for it to clear, but though we could see blue sky
at times, it was never between us and the sun. After dicking around
the campsite for a while, Daniel and Tina, who had to leave that day,
decided to get going early instead of trying to get some climbing in.
We bid them, and my car, a sad farewell. Meanwhile, I managed to score
a site on the back loop of Hidden Valley, and helped Jack move his tent
over there to secure it.<p>

We eventually gave up on waiting for the weather to improve, and headed
for the Old Woman for a bit of climbing. Since Jack hadn't done them
before, I had him lead Toe Jam and Bearded Cabbage. This time around,
I had huge problems on Bearded Cabbage, having to be lowered to the
ground from the half way point on my first attempt as I couldn't
secure myself in the crack. How shameful! Jack declined to have a
go at Spider Line, despite my assertions that it was a beautiful line.
So we moved around the corner and did
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#double cross">Double Cross</A></b> (5.7).
Jack had forgotten to bring his ATC, so we did a gri-gri simul-rap
from the top. First time I've tried that - worked fine though.<p>

John and Michelle showed up in their VW van later that day, so we
stuck them in the site that Jack had set up in.<p>

I can't remember now if Matt and Susan (and Bailey the dog) came on
the 29th or 30th, but it was somewhere around this time. After
unpacking his truck, the amount of food laid out made it look like he
had mounted a serious raiding expedition Trader Joe's - haven't seen
that many Tasty Bites assembled in one place before.<p>

Jack and I headed for Steve's Canyon, where we warmed up on
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#sidewinder">Sidewinder</A></b> (5.10b).
Jack shrieked and moaned with fear on the long dike traverse, but
made it to the end without incident. We then moved on to
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#jumping jack crack">Jumping Jack 
Crack</A></b> (5.11a),
for which Jack had made me lug the #4.5 cam. He had fun in the
chimney (he was wearing a knee pad the bastard), then slowly moved
through the crux over the bulge to the thin hands/off fingers crack.
I thought he had it, but with an enormous shriek of rage he popped 
out just before he was able to sink a good hand jam. He screamed so
loudly and with such duration, that I was sure that he had left
a finger behind in the crack. I think everyone else in the canyon
had the same impression.</table><p>

He got back in, and then finished it off without too much of a
problem. Then it was my turn. I had tried this one last march,
and had flailed miserably on it. Amazingly enough, I was able to
get through it without hanging, though opened up a knuckle and left
a nice bit of blood behind. Definitely a very challenging 11a, and
a good test piece. I guess it'll be my turn to lead it next time.<p>

I then led
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#decompensator of lhasa">The Decompensator of 
Lhasa</A></b> (5.10d),
which I had followed last year. Rather spicy through the slab at the
top, especially if you do it the way I did, and not see the easier
path to the right of the 2nd bolt. When Jack came up to the top, I
managed to convince him that he should lead
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#grain surgery">Grain Surgery</A></b> (5.10b).
He had some serious hesitation at the top, in the run out section above
the last bolt, going up and down a few times, before finding a path
that pleased him way off to the side. I remembered going straight up
after the last bolt, and did it that way again this time - seemed like
the more natural solution, but it could be a height dependent thing.<p>

We then finished up by setting a TR over 
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#super monster killer">Super Monster 
Killer</A></b> (5.11a), a really miserable flaring crack/slab. No
way in hell would I want to lead that.<p>

Late that evening, Dan and Lynsey showed up. Jim and Brenda had
had to leave, as Gavin, one of their kids was having bad ear problems,
so we snagged the open site and had them park there.<p>

That night, as I was going to bed, I heard a loud voice shout out
"Do you need a rescue?" Apparently, the rangers had decided to make
a midnight foray up Intersection Rock to search for beer kegs - some
had been stashed there last year before new year's eve. Someone in
the campsite who had a million candlepower spotlight had seen them
make their stealthy way up, and pinned them with the beam, then
threw out the question to them, for all to hear. The following exchange
was then heard:<p>
Rangers: "unhhh... no, we're ok. Thanks."<br>
Mr. Spotlight: "You know it's really dangerous up there in the dark!
You should be very careful!"<br>
Rangers: "Yeah, thanks. We're fine."<p>

Much laughter ensued.<p>

When they finally came down (after not having found any offending
kegs), they tried to bust Mr. Spotlight for making too much noise
after 10PM.<p>

Wednesday was going to be our rest day. I didn't think that I had
been climbing enough to actually merit a rest - but then I'm known
for beating myself into the ground. I'm sure my muscles appreciated it.
We also had to rest up for the festivities of the evening.
It was bright and sunny, though somewhat windy. We started off on
Intersection Rock, where Jack led
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#north overhang">North Overhang</A></b> (5.9).
Old school 5.9, as one moves out of the roof and around the corner. But
the jams are good, even if the bolts are of questionable quality.<p>

We moved across the way and into the sun, where Jack went up 
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#dogleg">Dogleg</A></b> (5.8).
I had forgotten that the first move is the crux, especially if you're
not really tall. But Jack managed it with only a little grumbling,
and ran up the rest of the climb. I followed, then went over the
top where I saw 
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#jeronimo">Jeronimo</A></b> (5.7).
I remember doing that years ago, and was eager to give it the
proper treatment. This involves climbing the crack, then hanging
upside down over the top from ones knees, and shouting "Jeronimo"
at the top of one's voice. I did this, getting applause from the
ground, but Jack declined to make a fool of himself like I did.
He also grumbled over the rating - claiming that no overhanging
fist crack could possibly be 5.7.<p>

We rapped down, said hello to Dan and Lynsey who were working on
Stem Gem, then tried a new climb on the arete between Double Cross
and Orphan. Just bolts, and it felt vaguely 5.9. Fun, but nothing
to write home about.<p>

Jack and I headed into town for a quick shower - he was complaining
about my aroma, but <b>I</b> couldn't detect anything. When we got
back, we found the rangers out in full force. They had set up a
road block at the entrance to Hidden Valley campground, and were
checking each car to see if we were smuggling any illicit contraband
or illegal aliens.  Well, actually they were just checking to see 
if we had a legal parking spot. They were obviously expecting some
serious misbehavior, and even had a fire truck ready for "crowd control"
purposes. We all assembled around the campfire, and cooked up a big
communal dinner, then waited for the madness to begin. Said madness
failed to appear. I wandered around to other fires from time to time,
to check out if anything more exciting was going on, but failed to
find anything. There was a large crowd at the Buttery Flake, but it
was pretty tame, with lots of little kids. The most excitement I saw
was a juggler who had 3 flaming sticks going, and someone set up 
some flashing Christmas lights on intersection rock. When midnight
rolled around, we all cheered then retreated to our tents. I think
we're all just getting old. But then again, so it seemed with
everyone else.<p>

Gunsmoke
High Noon
A Streetcar Named Desire
Something else
</pre>

We got up, without hangovers as we were a bunch of lightweights
the night before, and had many eggs for breakfast waiting for
it to warm up and the clouds to clear. Neither happened. So
instead of doing routes, we headed for the Barker Dam area for
a little bouldering. We started off on Gunsmoke, then played
around on High Noon. Or at least I played around - Matt, Dan and
Jack got really into it. None of them managed to stick the
sloper, but Matt and Dan got pretty close. I think the jumping
down and cold weather we bad for my knee, as it started to ache
soon thereafter. Also, one of my fingers was acting up, so I
decided to take it easy. We played around on some other boulder
problems, namely A Streetcar Named Desire, and something else 
whose name I don't know not far from Gunsmoke.</table><p>

Eventually we got tired of it all, and headed back to the campground 
to regroup. There we were treated to one of the most spectacular
sunsets I've ever seen. People all around the campsite were cheering
wildly at the incredible display of colours.</table><p>

After all the screaming settled down, we headed into town for
some food. We had a fine dinner at the Crossroads Cafe, and
then suddenly decided to go see a movie. Unfortunately we got
bad movie beta from the restaurant, and discovered that we were
an hour late for the start of "Return of the King." So we
headed back to the campsite, with a quick stop at a store to
stock up on eggs, donuts, and brownies. The latter two were
consumed around the campfire, while the 18 eggs were saved
for the next morning.<p>

More Monkey than Funky 5.11c
When You're a Jet 5.11c
</pre>

Many eggs this morning. Omelets and eggy-bread. It was sunny,
though somewhat windy. So Jack and I bundled up and made for
the Monkey. Steve, a local climber who had quit his job, sold
his house, and left his girlfriend so he could go climbing,
joined us. Jack led it first with a couple of hangs, then
set up a TR and came down to worked the corner. I followed
it next, and managed a clean ascent. Woo hoo! Steve also had
a go, then we all did it again. I believe I have the sequence
worked out - now all I have to do is remember it for the next
trip, whenever that'll be.<p>

Steve suggested trying out
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#when you're a jet">When You're a 
Jet</A></b> (5.11c), which is located nearby. So we went over
there, and Steve set up a TR on it. A bouldery start leads
to a reach around an overhanging bulge, into a diagonal rail/finger crack.
Then a big move up to a hand crack with a loose boulder thrown in,
to finish on a gentle finger crack. What fun! Steve went up first,
and after figured out that a figure 4 solved the problem of getting
from the rail to the hand crack. Sure looked cool! Jack went up next,
and did a series of heel hooks along the rail, and then pretty much
dynoed to the crack. I went last, campused the rail, then did the
figure 4. Sweet! First time I've ever had to do a non-gratuitous figure 4!

I pulled the anchor, then we headed back to camp where we decided to
have another attempt at the movie. John, Michelle, Matt and Susan had
already packed up and left, but Dan and Lynsey were still staying
around for another night, though they had gone ahead of us to get a
shower.  So back to Crossroads Cafe for us. Just as we were pulling up
by the Coyote Corner, Matt came up behind us and tried to further
damage his truck by rear ending us. Well, not really, but he looked
like he wanted to try. They joined us for dinner, and we all went to
the movie - at the correct time this time. After the movie, Matt and
Susan decided to start the drive back to Berkeley. They didn't make it
very far, and spent the night in a motel. The remaining hard core
folks, that is Jack, Dan, Lynsey, Joel, Linda and I, spent one more
night at the Tree. We were worried by the weather, as it looked like a
huge storm was coming in. But no rain touched down, only strong winds
- some people in fact had serious tent problems as a result.<p>

<font size=4><b>Saturday Jan 3 - Various </b></font><p>

Hobbit Roof 5.10d
Gunsmoke
Pigpen
Cyclops Boulders
</pre>

Damn. Jack just said that he won't send me the pictures until I
finish this trip report. Ok, so here's the last day!<p>

We had yet another breakfast that involved huge numbers of eggs. I
guess you need something filling like that to keep the cold off!
It was another bright and sunny day, so after packing up and filling
the car with a remarkable amount of crap, Jack and I went to "have a
look" at 
<b><A href="../db/main.shtml#hobbit roof">Hobbit Roof</A></b> (5.10d).
It looked very pleasant, so we went back to the car, grabbed some gear,
and ran up it. The crux is the slab below the roof, though it's well
protected by a bolt. The roof move is fairly trivial - some people
claim it 10b, but it didn't really feel that hard to me. I guess my
standard for a 5.10 roof is Hoodwink.<p>

Dan and Lynsey had gone off to have yet another run at Gunsmoke, as 
Lynsey felt that she was oh so close to getting it, so we drove
back there and joined them. I did a couple of laps, amazed to find
that I still had it in me, then went and did that other unknown
boulder problem that we had played on two days ago. At that point
my finger really started to hurt, so I decided to play it safe and
not boulder any more. However, all the rest were still game to
go, so we drove back to the campground and played on Pigpen (aka
Bachar Cracker of the desert), and the Cyclops Boulders. Much fun
was had by all, especially Dan as he attempted time and time again
to get a stem/smear problem that all the "chicks" had been able
to get. Even Jack managed it! Finally, after much wailing and
gnashing of teeth, he succeeded. Dusk was starting to fall, and
with it the temperature, so we called it a day and a trip. With
one more stop at the Crossroads Cafe for dinner, we headed back
to civilization (though I use the term loosely). Jack drove the
whole way at high speed, with barely a pause for gas, and we
were back in Berkeley before 1AM. The rest took a more leisurely
approach, and bivvied for the night, arriving on Sunday afternoon.<p>

A good trip all in all. While the weather was variable and at times
horrendous, we still had fun. Not a huge number of climbs were
done, but there were some quality ascents in there. Now I'm torn
between going back there in March, or trying out Indian Creek. Arggh!<p>
