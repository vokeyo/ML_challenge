      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A prairie dog (<em>Cynomys
          ludovicianus</em>) colony with a known history of habitation was studied
          to quantify the effects of herbivory on plant
        species composition, dominance, stature and diversity in a North American
        mixed-grass prairie. Gradient analysis was used to quantify the realationship
        between plant community structure, prairie dog density, burrow density
        and habitation history and to document community-level responses of plants
        subjected to heavy grazing pressure. The results quantify the type, rate
        and extent of change which plant populations and communities may undergo
        in response to the differential grazing of plants variously tolerant
      of defoliation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Detrended correspondence
          analysis indicated that 69% of the between-sample floristic variance
          on the site was attributable to prairie dog habitation.
          Perennial grasses were rapidly displaced from the site withing 3 yr
          of colonization and were replaced by annual forbs. The net result was
          an
          increase in species richness and diversity on the prairie dog colony.
          Within the colony, however, the number of species was more a function
        of stand size than colonization history.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Significant decreases
          in canopy stature after 2 yr of habitation resulted from replacement
          of mid-height grass species by shortgrass species
            and forbs. In addition, there was a shift from tall forms of off-colony
            species
            to dwarf growth forms of the same species on the colony. Decreases
            in litter and increases in bare soil cover were substantial during
            the first
          2 yr of habitation but change little thereafter.</font></p>
