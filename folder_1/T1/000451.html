This is the determination of the Railroad Retirement Board concerning the status 
of Indiana Boxcar Corporation (IBC), as an employer under the Railroad 
Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. § 231 et seq.) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance 
Act (45 U.S.C. § 351 et seq.).<p>Information regarding IBC was provided by R. 
Powell Felix, President of IBC. According to Mr. Felix, IBC was incorporated 
March 7, 1988. IBC began doing business in 1988, but had no employees until 
1996. IBC has two employees; Mr. Felix has been an employee since 1996, and 
since 2005, Ms. Kesha Felix has also been an employee of IBC<span class="footnote"><a href="#1">1</a></span>.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Felix, the nature of the work the IBC employees have done 
has “varied considerably” over the years. Since 1988 IBC has owned a fleet of 
boxcars. For over the past decade IBC has also bought, sold, and leased used 
locomotives. In addition, IBC has performed rerailing services for derailed 
cars, as well as track analysis. Customers for these various services include 
industries served by rail, short line railroads, and state agencies.</p>
<p>Since 1997 IBC has been involved in the operating or management of short line 
railroads. Mr. Felix describes the business dealings which IBC has had with 
“scores of railroads over the past two decades” as ranging from “collecting car 
hire or lease rental for use of IBC owned equipment” to ownership or management 
of short line railroads. In his letter of May 21, 2007, Mr. Felix states that 
“IBC presently owns railcars, locomotives, vehicles, equipment, inventory, and 
short line railroads. Some of these assets are leased to or used by affiliated 
railroads and some assets are leased to unrelated third parties”. In a letter 
dated November 6, 2007, Mr. Felix described IBC’s management services as 
including leasing locomotives to Vermilion Valley Railroad Company, Inc., 
Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad Company, Inc., and Youngstown &amp; Southeastern 
Railroad Company, Inc.; leasing maintenance equipment to Chesapeake and Indiana 
Railroad Company, Inc., and Youngstown &amp; Southeastern Railroad Company; and 
maintaining a central corporate office.</p>
<p>While no railroads have ever had any ownership in IBC, IBC has had, and 
continues to have, ownership or management relationships with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Evansville Terminal Railway Company, Inc. - indirect and direct ownership 
from 1997 to 2000 (company sold)<span class="footnote"><a href="#2">2</a></span>; 
<br>
- Vermilion Valley Railroad Company, Inc. (B.A. No. 2396) – 100% owned by IBC, 
2003 to present; <br>
- Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad Company, Inc. (B.A. No. 2397) 
– direct ownership, 2004 to present; <br>
- Tishomingo Railroad Company, Inc. (B.A. 
No. 4573) – 50% owned by IBC<span class="footnote"><a href="#3">3</a></span>, 
2006 to present; <br>
- Ohi-Rail Corporation (B.A. No. 3350) – not owned by IBC, 
rather IBC is the contracted manager of the railroad<span class="footnote"><a href="#4">4</a></span>, 
2006 to present; and - Youngstown &amp; Southeastern Railroad Company, Inc. – 100% 
owned by IBC, 2006 to present<span class="footnote"><a href="#5">5</a></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Felix and his wife, Sandra M. Felix, are the sole owners of IBC, and, as 
stated above, Mr. Felix is President of IBC. Mr. Felix also is (or has been) 
President of each of the railroads named above. Mr. Felix is presently General 
Manager of Ohi-Rail Corporation. As stated above, Mr. Felix has explained that 
the two employees of IBC have “dual employment with multiple railroads”. 
Further, when IBC became an owner of a railroad in 1997, employment for Mr. 
Felix was segregated between IBC’s “non-covered activities and railroad 
employment”. According to Mr. Felix, the compensation for both himself and Ms. 
Felix is segregated with appropriate railroad retirement taxes and contributions 
paid<span class="footnote"><a href="#6">6</a></span>. IBC maintains separate books and files individual tax returns for its 
related railroads. IBC pays salaries for the employment associated with its 
freight car and locomotive business. Mr. Felix explained that all of the 
railroads maintain separate banking accounts, separate books, file separate tax 
returns, have individually issued credit cards and/or separate credit facilities 
distinct from IBC, and have (with the exception of Vermilion Valley Railroad) 
individually billed telephone lines (either land or mobile), although the shared 
corporate number is also listed for each railroad. None of the track of IBC’s 
affiliated railroads is owned by the railroads themselves. All track is owned by 
unrelated third parties, such as shippers or governmental entities.</p>
<p>In Surface Transportation Board Finance Docket No. 34961, IBC filed a notice 
of exemption to continue in control of the Youngstown &amp; Southeastern Railway 
Company (Y&amp;S), upon Y&amp;S’s becoming a Class III rail carrier. Finance Docket No. 
34961 also notes that IBC currently controls three other Class II rail carriers, 
the Vermilion Valley Railroad Company, Inc.; the Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad 
Company, Inc.; and the Tishomingo Railroad Company, Inc.</p>
<p>Section 1(a)(1) of the Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C.§ 231(a)(1)), 
insofar as relevant here, defines a covered employer as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) any carrier by railroad subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface 
Transportation Board under Part A of subtitle IV of title 49, United States 
Code;</p>
<p>(ii) any company which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by, or 
under common control with, one or more employers as defined in paragraph (i) of 
this subdivision and which operates any equipment or facility or performs any 
service (except trucking service, casual service, and the casual operation of 
equipment or facilities) in connection with the transportation of passengers or 
property by railroad * * *.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sections 1(a) and 1(b) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 
§§ 351(a) and (b)) contain substantially similar definitions, as does section 
3231 of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA), 26 U.S.C. 3231.</p>
<p>Section 202.4 of the Board’s regulations defines “control” as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A company or person is controlled by one or more carriers, whenever there 
exists in one or more such carriers the right or power by any means, method or 
circumstance, irrespective of stock ownership to direct, either directly or 
indirectly, the policies and business of such a company or person and in any 
case in which a carrier is in fact exercising direction of the policies and 
business of such a company or person. (20 CFR 202.4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 202.5 of the Board’s regulations provides that a company or person is 
under common control with a carrier whenever the control of such company or 
person is in the same person, persons, or company as that by which such carrier 
is controlled (20 CFR 202.5).</p>
<p>In this case, Mr. Felix is the president of IBC and of several railroads: 
Vermilion Valley Railroad Company (BA No. 2396, with service creditable from 
April 24, 2003 to date), Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad Company, Inc. (BA No. 
2397, with service creditable from August 11, 2004 to date), Tishomingo Railroad 
Company, Inc. (BA No. 4573, with service creditable from May 13, 2000 to date), 
and Youngstown &amp; Southeastern Railroad Company, Inc. (BA No. 2287, with service 
creditable from December 1, 2006 to date) In addition, Mr. Felix was the 
president of Evansville Terminal Railway Company, Inc. from 1997 to 2000 (former 
BA No. 2369, with service creditable from July 22, 1996 through December 31, 
2000).</p>
<p>Because Mr. Felix is the president of both IBC and the railroads listed in 
the preceding paragraph, the Board finds that IBC is under common control with 
those railroads within the meaning of section 1(a)(1)(ii) of the RRA and the 
corresponding section of the RUIA. The next question we must therefore address 
is whether IBC performs any service in connection with railroad transportation.</p>
<p>The evidence of record establishes that IBC does not conduct rail carrier 
operations itself. IBC has, however, been involved in the operating or 
management of short line railroads since 1997. Accordingly, the Board finds that 
IBC has been performing services in connection with the transportation of 
passengers or property by railroad for the period 1997 to 2000, when it had an 
ownership relationship with Evansville Terminal Railway Company, Inc., and then 
again from 2003 to the present, when it had ownership relationships with 
Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad Company, Inc. (2003 to present), Tishomingo 
Railroad Company, Inc. (2006 to present), and Youngstown &amp; Southeastern Railroad 
Company, Inc. (2006 to present), as well as performing as the contracted manager 
of Ohi-Rail Corporation (2006 to present), all of which are covered rail carrier 
employers. The Board holds that IBC became an affiliate employer under the 
Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Acts effective January 
1, 1997, the beginning of the first year during which it was under common 
control with a rail carrier employer.</p>
