	<b>Communication Plan</b>: The results of this project will be reported in peer-reviewed scientific publications, as well as in presentations at scientific meetings.  A report will be produced for the National Park Service.  A narrowly-targeted, low cost (in terms of labor and time) monitoring program for beach wrack and associated invertebrates will be provided for CACO.  Supporting materials for compiling and interpreting monitoring data will be provided.

The products from this project will provide Resource Management staff at CACO with a monitoring program for beach biota that will be doable by park staff, will fulfill the requirements of the negotiated rules on beach traffic, and will give resource managers clear indications of the effects of their management actions on the beach biota.  The reports from this project will provide the first quantitative description of the community structure of the beach wrack biota.  This will provide basic understanding of this fauna that will allow assessment of changes in beach fauna, and of the effects of disturbances such as beach nourishment and oil spills, as well as ORV traffic.  The project will also provide previously unavailable information about the natural dynamics of organisms that provide food for shore birds, including the listed piping plover.<br><b>Objectives</b>: This task addresses goal 5 of Terrestrial, Freshwater and Marine Ecosystems: Quantify and understand factors influencing patterns of temporal and spatial variability in key ecosystem components.  This task also addresses goal 2 of Status and Trends of Biological Resources: Develop and evaluate inventory and monitoring methods, protocols, experimental designs, analytic tools, models, and technologies to measure biological status and trends.
	 	 
Community-level dynamics of the beach invertebrate fauna at Cape Cod National Seashore will be described and quantified.  A monitoring program will be developed to assess the effects of offroad vehicle traffic on the beach biota.

Results of the experiments will be analyzed, and the preliminary monitoring program will be evaluated based on the validation samples.  

Results will be presented to DOI staff with management interests in shoreline change and beach biota (e.g., coastal national parks and FWS staff and others working on piping plovers), and to USGS coastal scientists.  Manuscripts and other standard scientific reporting instruments will be prepared.<br><b>Statement of Problem</b>: Cape Cod National Seashore (CACO) harbors forty miles of pristine sandy beaches that attract millions of visitors each year.  ORV use on beaches, primarily for fishing, predates the establishment of CACO in 1961.  Until recently, many used the 8.5?mile Off?Road Vehicle (ORV) corridor (designated by the 1981/1985 ORV Management Plan) to access recreation sites.  However, growing concern over nesting piping plovers Charadrius melodus (federally?designated threatened in 1986) has resulted in revision of the old ORV rule. The new ORV rule  will close a section of the existing off?road vehicle corridor (Exit 8 to High Head North), but simultaneously open a section of the outer beach that was formerly closed (Coast Guard Beach to Longnook). This change could result in shifting impacts on ocean beach invertebrates, which comprise an important part of the piping plover's diet and a major portion of the natural beach community.  Optimum foraging habitat appears to be a factor in piping plover nest site selection and reproductive success.  As part of the agreement that gave rise to the new ORV rule, CACO is required to send yearly reports to the Secretary of the Interior, describing the effects of vehicle traffic on the beach fauna.  This agreement was developed using the ¿Negotiated Rule Making¿ process, so CACO is obligated to carry out its provisions.  In fact, CACO has recently come under threat of litigation if it does not carry out the beach biota monitoring provision of the negotiated agreement. 

	In this project we will: (1) inventory the beach fauna at CACO, assess underlying variability, and  set up a long-term monitoring program that can assess the status of the natural community on beaches open vs. closed to ORV traffic;. and  (2) monitor the relationships between major environmental factors and beach invertebrate communities to determine whether ORV traffic or environmental differences account for the observed differences in beach biota between sites.  Status of the beach biota will be assessed by monitoring species richness, abundance of indicator species, dominance-diversity relationships, and guild structure of the beach communities.
