Abstract

We describe the impact of a psychosocial intervention, critical time intervention
(CTI), on the cardinal symptom dimensions of schizophrenia, namely negative,
positive, and general psychopathology. Ninety-six men with schizophrenia and
other psychotic disorders who were discharged from a homeless shelter were
randomly assigned to receive either CTI or usual services only. CTI is a
time-limited intervention designed to enhance continuity of care during the
transition from institution to community. Symptom severity at baseline and at 6
months was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Using data
on 76 subjects for whom we have complete symptom data, we assessed the impact of
CTI on change in symptoms. The results suggest that CTI was associated with a
statistically significant decrease in negative symptoms at the 6-month
follow-up, reflecting modest clinical improvement. There was no significant
effect on positive or general psychopathology symptoms.

----------------------------------------------

In an earlier publication, we reported the results of a randomized clinical
trial demonstrating the effectiveness of critical time intervention (CTI) in
preventing recurrent homelessness among homeless men with schizophrenia and
other psychotic disorders (Susser et al., 1997). Here we describe the impact of
this psychosocial intervention on the cardinal symptom dimensions of schizophrenia,
namely negative, positive, and general psychopathology.

Typically, traditional antipsychotic medications produce significant improvement
in hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking-so-called positive
symptoms-whereas they are relatively ineffective against the apathy, blunted
affect, and social withdrawal that characterize the negative symptom domain in
schizophrenia. Recent studies have suggested that the newer antipsychotics, in
contrast to standard or conventional antipsychotics, might treat negative and
general psychopathology symptoms in addition to positive symptoms (Beasley et
al., 1997; Chouinard et al., 1993; Marder and Meibach 1994). Although few
studies have focused specifically on the impact of psychosocial interventions on
symptom clusters in schizophrenia, a recent meta-analysis of the effectiveness
of psychosocial treatments in schizophrenia (Mojtabai et al., 1998) suggests
that such interventions, in conjunction with somatic treatment, may have a
greater effect on negative symptoms than on positive or general psychopathology
symptoms.

Discontinuity between institutional and community treatment is a critical
problem (Dorwart and Hoover 1994; Olfson et al., 1998) that has contributed to a
range of negative outcomes among persons with severe mental illness after
institutional care. CTI is a time-limited intervention that overlaps the period
before and after discharge from the institution to the community. A key aspect
of CTI is that the post-discharge phase of the intervention is delivered by
staff who have established relationships with patients during their institutional
stay. CTI shares with long-term assertive community treatment models (Lehman et
al., 1997) a focus on stabilizing patients in the community through "in vivo"
development of independent living skills and by building effective support
networks in the community. The emphasis, however, is on maintaining continuity
of care during a critical period of transition, whereas primary responsibility
is gradually passed to the existing supports in the community.

In our randomized clinical trial of CTI among severely mentally ill men being
discharged from a shelter to community living, we found the intervention to be
associated with a significant, lasting reduction in post-discharge homelessness.
Although CTI was designed specifically to prevent homelessness, we speculated
that it might also have a favorable impact on important clinical outcomes. In
the analyses below, we examine whether, in the context of treatment with
maintenance antipsychotic pharmacotherapy, this psychosocial intervention is
associated with differential effects on positive, negative, and general
psychopathology symptoms, respectively, over a 6-month follow-up period.

Methods

Subjects

The methods of the CTI study have been described in detail in our previous
report (Susser et al., 1997). Briefly, the subjects were patients discharged
from an on-site psychiatry program in a New York City men's shelter to
community-based housing. All patients of the program had severe mental illness,
usually schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders such as bipolar disorder. The
vast majority were African-Americans and Latinos.

The on-site program, described in detail elsewhere (Valencia et al., 1996;
Valencia et al., 1997), treated 60 to 80 men at any given time, providing
outreach and rehabilitation services and preparing them for housing in the
community. Patients who completed the on-site program had access to a broad
spectrum of supportive housing in New York City, ranging from intensively
supervised community residences to single-room-occupancy hotels with on-site
social services. Nonetheless, a significant minority of men could not or would
not be accommodated in any of these settings and were discharged to family,
friends, or miscellaneous other arrangements.

Over a 2-year period (1991 to 1993), all 102 men who were being discharged to
housing in the New York City region were invited to participate in the clinical
trial. Ninety-six (94%) chose to participate and signed an informed consent
form. After their housing placement had been selected, these men were randomly
assigned to receive either CTI or usual services only (USO). The men in the CTI
group received 9 months of CTI plus usual services and then usual services only
for the following 9 months. The men in the USO group received usual services
only for the entire 18 months of the study.

Complete follow-up data on homelessness-the study's primary outcome-was obtained
on the entire sample. To maximize follow-up on the primary outcome in the
context of a limited budget, symptom ratings and other measures of clinical
outcome were not collected on subjects enrolled during the latter stages of the
study. We report here on the 76 subjects (38 in CTI and 38 in USO) for whom we
have complete symptom data at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. When we
compared these 76 subjects with the remaining 20 subjects on demographic,
diagnostic, and homelessness variables, we found no significant differences
between groups.

Intervention

CTI has two components. The first is to strengthen the individual's long-term
ties to services, family, and friends. These supports are potentially available
in varying measures, but mentally ill individuals and those upon whom they
depend often need assistance to work with one another. The second component of
CTI is providing emotional and practical support during the critical time of
transition. During a stay in an institution such as a large shelter, an
individual may develop strong ties and become used to having many of his social
and physical needs met on-site. The return to a possibly isolated and destitute
life in the community, however welcome, can be emotionally painful.

For each man randomly assigned to CTI, the clinical team devised a plan for the
transfer of care to other formal and informal supports. For this purpose, the
team identified one or two specific areas of potential discontinuity that were
related to the risk of homelessness for that individual, and in which intervention
was likely to be effective in preventing homelessness, for instance, medication
adherence or money management. Each man was then assigned to a "CTI worker" to
implement the plan. This worker did not need to have a professional degree but
did need to have experience working with this population and enough "street
smarts" to work in vivo with these men in the community. A psychiatrist or other
mental health professional supervised the CTI worker.

To implement the first component of CTI, the strengthening of long-term ties,
this CTI worker provided support for both the man and those who could assist him
in the areas of treatment that were selected. This generally entailed visiting
the family home or community residence, being present at appointments, and
giving advice in crises. The CTI worker often functioned as a mediator, helping
to ensure that the man and his supports communicated until they had negotiated
workable relationships between themselves. When this approach failed, the CTI
worker could intervene directly. Occasionally, the man was transferred to
another community service. He could also be relocated to another residence where
his particular form of disturbed behavior was more likely to be tolerated.

To implement the second component of CTI, support during a critical period,
during the first 2 weeks after discharge the CTI worker spent time with the
patient in the community observing his physical and social surroundings and
daily habits. Subsequent support was individually tailored; at one extreme some
patients needed only a few follow-up visits, whereas other patients needed
frequent visits and practical assistance for several months.

In the USO group, the men were referred to mental health and rehabilitation
programs that were generally of high quality. Following the usual model of
discharge from an institution, the staff of the onsite shelter psychiatry
program were available to these agencies for consultation on request but did not
actively seek a role in the patient's care after discharge. The men were also
referred as needed to community agencies for substance abuse, general health,
income support, education, legal advocacy, and other services. The number and
the range of potential service agencies in New York City was greater than in
most urban areas. The connections among the various agencies in regard to the
care of an individual, however, were generally weak and unsystematized.

The CTI and USO interventions were applied in a standardized fashion, as
specified in a manual (available from the first author). To ensure adherence to
the specified protocols, the investigators met weekly with the clinical team.
The clinical team presented cases in CTI and USO at these meetings, and in each
case presentation they specified the relation of the treatment plan to the
respective CTI or USO protocol. In this way, any departures from the intended
experimental and control treatments were detected rapidly.

Measures

Psychiatric Symptoms. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al., 1992), a 30-item, 7-point severity
scale that has been widely employed in both clinical and research settings,
including a prior study of homelessness among chronically mentally ill adults
(Opler et al., 1994). The PANSS generates scale scores in three domains-positive
symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology. The positive scale is
computed by summing ratings on delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory
behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility.
The negative scale is computed by summing ratings on blunted affect, emotional
withdrawal, poor rapport, passive-apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in
abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped
thinking. The general psychopathology scale consists of the sum of the following
16 items not included in the positive and negative scales: somatic concern,
anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, depression, motor
retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, disorientation, poor
attention, lack of judgment and insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse
control, preoccupation, and active social avoidance. For each scale, lower
scores indicate less psychopathology. Symptom ratings were performed at baseline
and 6 months by trained raters blind to group assignment. Reliability for these
measures was good (alpha for baseline positive, negative, and general symptoms
were .80, .86, and .89, respectively).

Data Analysis

The primary purpose of the data analyses was to examine differences between the
experimental and control groups on the outcomes of interest. First, we compared
the experimental and control group means and standard deviations for each
symptom scale at baseline and 6 months. To formally assess the effect of the
intervention on psychiatric symptoms, we then performed three multivariate
regression analyses in which the dependent variable was one of the three symptom
scales measured at 6 months, the independent variable was group membership, and
the respective baseline symptom factor score was entered as a covariate. We
conducted further analyses stratifying by age group and ethnic group. The
results of these analyses were unchanged.

Results

Table 1 provides the demographic and diagnostic characteristics of the sample.
The sample was primarily African-American, and most men were over age 35 (median
age = 36). The majority of the sample had been homeless for over a year during
their lifetime. Schizophrenia and its related disorders (including schizoaffective
and schizophreniform) were the most frequent diagnoses.

----------------------------------------------

There were 76 cases (38 CTI and 38 USO) for whom there were complete symptom
data at base-line and at 6 months. Table 2 compares the CTI and the USO groups
on mean symptom scale scores at these two time points (all scores and mean
differences are unadjusted). On the negative symptoms scale (baseline range = 8
to 36), the mean change in the CTI group was -2.6 compared with a mean change of
+1.0 in the USO group. On the positive symptoms scale (baseline range = 7 to
40), the mean change in the CTI group was -2.2 compared with a mean change of
-2.7 in the USO group. On the general psychopathology scale (baseline range = 19
to 67), the mean change in the CTI group was -6.5 compared with a mean change of
-3.1 in the USO group. In the regression analyses controlling for baseline score
for the 6-month outcomes, there was a significant group effect for negative
symptoms only (F = 5.7, p = .02).

Months 
    
  

----------------------------------------------

When we confined the analysis to 57 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia and
related disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and schizophreni-form
disorder), the pattern of results was quite similar. On the negative symptoms
scale, the mean change in the CTI group was -2.9 compared with a mean change of
+.5 in the USO group. On the positive symptoms scale, the mean change in the CTI
group was -3.1 compared with a mean change of -3.0 in the USO group. On the
general psychopathology scale, the mean change in the CTI group was -8.3
compared with a mean change of -4.4 in the USO group. In the regression analyses
controlling for baseline score for the 6-month outcomes, there was a marginally
significant group effect (F = 3.4, p = .07) for negative symptoms only (this
larger p value reflects the reduced statistical power associated with the
smaller sample size employed in these analyses).

Discussion

In this study, CTI was associated with a statistically significant decrease in
negative symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, reflecting modest clinical
improvement. This is an important finding as it is one of the few studies of
which we are aware that has focused specifically on the effect of a psychosocial
intervention on negative symptoms in psychotic disorders. It is also consistent
with the conclusion of a recent meta-analysis of controlled outcome studies in
this area (Mojtabai et al., 1998). There was no significant effect on positive
or general psychopathology symptoms. We consider below several possible
explanations for the observed reduction in negative symptoms.

Negative symptoms are frequently cited as among the most disabling aspects of
psychotic disorders and among the most resistant to treatment. Because standard
antipsychotics have been shown to have little if any impact on negative symptoms
(and none of the subjects in this study were receiving either the atypical
antipsychotic clozapine or the novel antipsychotics risperidone, olanzpine, or
quetiapine), it is unlikely that the observed reduction in negative symptoms in
the experimental group can be explained by a different pattern of medication use
in that group. Further, the lack of group differences on positive symptoms,
which are responsive to antipsychotic medications, also suggests that it is not
differences in medication use that account for the observed differences on
negative symptom scores. Nevertheless, we compared the proportion of subjects in
the experimental and control groups who reported having taken psychoactive
medications over the course of the follow-up period. At 6 months, the proportion
of experimental and control group members having taken antipsychotic medication
in the prior month were virtually identical, providing further evidence that the
treatment effect was not a function of differential rates of medication use.
Although we consider it unlikely, because we did not collect data on medication
dosing we cannot rule out the possibility that the USO group received higher
doses of standard neuroleptics and/or lower doses of antiparkinsonian medications
leading to higher levels of secondary negative symptoms (i.e., resulting from
neuroleptic medications).

As we have reported elsewhere (Susser et al., 1997) the treatment group
experienced significantly fewer homeless nights over the follow-up period than
did the control group. Therefore, we explored whether the observed effect on
negative symptoms was mediated by the experience of homelessness. To investigate
this possibility, we performed a hierarchical regression analysis predicting
negative symptom score at 6 months in which we first entered baseline negative
symptom score and treatment condition (step 1) followed by a variable indicating
the number of homeless nights experienced during the 6-month follow-up period
(step 2). We found no increase in explanatory power associated with the addition
of the homelessness variable (F of change = .20, p = .65), indicating that
reduced homelessness did not mediate the effect of the treatment on negative
symptom score at 6 months.

The evidence suggesting that neither medication nor homelessness accounted for
the observed reduction in negative symptoms supports the idea that the effect
can be attributed to the intervention. However, as in many experimental studies
that test a composite "package" of services such as CTI, it can be difficult to
identify the specific mechanisms through which the treatment produced the
observed effect. In this case, the primary focus of CTI was to prevent recurrent
homelessness after discharge from the shelter. How might the intervention have
directly contributed to the apparent improvement in negative symptoms?

Several studies have suggested that the degree of prefrontal cortical dysfunction
in schizophrenia is related both to impairments in carrying out executive tasks
and to severity of negative symptoms (Andreasen et al., 1992; Opler et al.,
1991; Wolkin et al., 1992). One intriguing possibility is that by encouraging
patients to focus on planning and organizing their transition from institution
to community living, CTI provides cognitive remediation, helping to reactivate
prefrontal cortical functions as they are summoned to carry out executive tasks
that were underutilized during lengthy periods of passivity and regression. In
future studies, we hope to investigate the prospect that this psychosocial
intervention may improve prefrontally mediated cognitive functions as well as
negative symptoms.

It is also possible to offer a psychodynamic mechanism that may have contributed
to the reduction in negative symptoms. For homeless mentally ill men who
commonly have experienced multiple emotional losses during their lives, the
withdrawal, apathy, and affective blunting that comprise negative symptoms may,
in part, be a reaction to these important psychological events. CTI focuses
explicitly on issues of relationship and social support. As described above, one
of its key elements is that the strong ties that develop between patients and
treatment staff are not abruptly severed at the point of discharge but rather
are used to promote successful community reintegration through a successful
transition process. Perhaps this experience plays a role in ameliorating the
hopelessness and despair that has characterized these men's lives and, in turn,
leads to an observed lessening in negative symptoms.

In all likelihood, no single mechanism can account for the reduction in negative
symptoms we observed in the experimental group. Rather, we suspect that this
improvement may be attributable to the synergistic effect of cognitive,
psychopharmacological, and psychodynamic mechanisms operating simultaneously. We
hope to design future studies of the CTI model in such a way as to shed further
light on this question.

As noted above, there was no significant effect of CTI on positive or general
psychopathology symptoms. The most recent quantitative review of the research on
the role of psychosocial treatments in schizophrenia suggested that positive and
general symptoms tend to be less responsive to psychosocial interventions than
are negative symptoms (Mojtabai et al., 1998). Although the reasons for this are
not well understood, it may be that negative symptoms, particularly among
persons who have been ill for a number of years, are partly related to factors
such as social isolation and demoralization, which might be more responsive to
psychosocial interventions.

Limitations

There were a number of limitations to the study. First, the number of total
participants was modest. Although 96 men were randomized into the two experimental
conditions, symptom data at baseline and 6-month follow-up was available for
only 76 men. Although there appear to be no systematic differences between these
76 men and the 20 for whom data are incomplete, it is possible that this may
have affected the results to some unknown degree. Second, although the change in
negative symptoms in the full group was statistically significant at the .05
level, the magnitude of the effect was modest.

Third, the degree to which the observed effect on negative symptoms was a
lasting one cannot be adequately assessed since our outcome data were collected
at 6 months. However, in a subgroup of 47 subjects whose symptoms were measured
at 18 months, the trend was toward continued lower levels of negative symptoms
in the experimental group when compared with the controls (mean negative
symptoms score in CTI group = 15.3, SD = 4.8; mean negative symptoms score in
USO group = 17.6, SD = 6.5, p = .16).

Finally, although we specified a priori that we would evaluate the effect of our
intervention on psychiatric symptoms, the intriguing finding presented here did
not conform with our original hypothesis, which predicted improvement in
negative, positive, and general psychopathology symptoms.

Conclusions

In an earlier paper, we reported that CTI was effective in its primary intended
outcome-reducing recurrent homelessness among severely mentally ill men after
discharge from a shelter. The present report suggests that a time-limited
intervention focused on the transitional period may also have had beneficial
effects on an important clinical outcome, namely negative symptoms, that has
stubbornly resisted the effect of treatment in many previous efforts. Because
negative symptoms are considered to play an important role with respect to the
quality of life of persons with severe mental disorders, this finding warrants
further study. Although CTI was originally designed and tested with homeless men
leaving a shelter, we believe that it may also be fruitfully applied in other
settings including psychiatric hospitals and correctional facilities.
