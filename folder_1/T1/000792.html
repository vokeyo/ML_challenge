A primary resource provided by the FLO crew is useful work in pursuit of the mission objectives.  <P>This resource was analyzed to determine how much crew time may be available for useful work on the Lunar surface.  An automated tool was developed to support sensitivity analysis in order to examine the effects of varying operational parameters of the mission.<P><H2>1.0  Introduction</H2><H3>1.1  Background</H3>The Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) has been defined by the United States government as a long-term effort to explore the Earth's moon and the planet Mars.  The SEI spans multiple programs and missions to send robotic and human spacecraft to the moon and Mars.  The First Lunar Outpost (FLO) mission has been defined as an initial return of humans to the moon.  The baseline for FLO includes a crew of four and a Lunar stay time of two Lunar daylight periods and one Lunar darkness period.<P>The Human Support function of the FLO study team has been established to perform integration of all aspects of the FLO mission which affect the crewmembers.  The Human Support area includes medical, life sciences, and human factors engineering aspects.  The NASA JSC Human Factors Project Office has participated in the FLO definition study, and as part of that participation a model of the FLO crew time resource was developed.<P><H3>1.2  Purpose</H3>Human factors analysis of the FLO is essential during the mission/systems definition phase to quantify and mitigate the uncertainties related to the crew's ability to perform the desired mission.  A significant part of this analysis is validation of the availability of crew time to perform useful work such as mission science.  This analysis integrates the operational aspects of the crew's mission with the design aspects of the systems which support them.<P>Crew size and Lunar stay time are important mission parameters in determining the sizing and design of systems and the ultimate cost of a flight program.  Modeling of crew time provides insight into the effect of varying these parameters on accomplishment of the mission objectives.<P>FLO system effectiveness is influenced by the hardware/software system design and by inherent human capabilities and constraints.  Significant crew constraints exist in the use of their time; therefore, crew time modeling can be an important input to overall system effectiveness analysis.<P>Operational planning for the FLO mission includes the allocation of mission functions to both crew and systems.  In that allocation, it is vital that crew time is managed to prevent over-allocation of this limited resource.<P><H3>1.3  Scope</H3>The analysis described in this document is focused on the Lunar surface habitation phase of the FLO human mission.  It is further constrained to the nominal planned mission, and does not investigate abort scenarios.  It attempts to encompass all aspects of crew activities during the nominal surface habitation phase.<P><H3>1.4  Approach</H3>This study was approached as an analysis of the effects of varying FLO mission parameters.  The method of study consisted of the following:<P>Gathering of information on crew operational activities and times,<BR>Integration of the information in the form of a parametric model,<BR>Performance of sensitivity analyses by varying model parameters.<P><H2>2.0  Model Development</H2><H3>2.1  Reference Information</H3><H4>2.1.1  Reference Mission</H4>The FLO Design Reference Mission (DRM) is currently documented in the First Lunar Outpost Requirements and Guidelines (FLORG) document1.  The following information is extracted from the DRM:<P>The DRM identifies the automated delivery, activation, and deployment of the crew surface habitat prior to crew launch from Earth.  The crew of four is able to move into the habitat and start science and exploration activities as soon as possible after they land on the moon.<P>The crew vehicle lands around Lunar dawn within walking distance of the outpost.  The crew lives in the surface habitat for up to a Lunar day-night-day cycle (45 days including contingencies).<P>The crew's first priority is to complete habitat activation and checkout.  They then perform science and engineering activities including environmental characterization, deployment of experiments, in-situ resource utilization, and life sciences research.<P>The crew uses an unpressurized rover to support extravehicular activity (EVA) traverses on the Lunar surface.  The capability is provided for daily EVAs.  During Lunar night, EVAs will be performed when lighting is sufficient.  The bulk of the intravehicular activity (IVA) laboratory research will be performed when EVA is not possible.<P>When the second Lunar sunset approaches, the crew will configure the outpost for their departure and leave the habitat for Earth.  As an option, a second crew of four will revisit the outpost for a second 45 day stay, performing activities similar to the first crew's.<P>A second document, the FLO Conceptual Surface Mission2, has been produced to describe additional details of the FLO crew surface operations phase.  The following statements are drawn from this document:<P>The optimum times to conduct EVAs on the Lunar surface are shortly after sunrise and shortly before sunset.<P>Laboratory IVAs include activities such as basic analysis, sorting, and packaging of samples for return to Earth; gravitational biology experiments and additional physiological experiments; and teleoperation of deployed instruments or scientific rovers.<P>Support IVAs include activities such as outpost maintenance and enhancement, EVA suit maintenance and repair, and training.<P>The primary monitoring of an EVA crew is done from Earth, allowing the IVA crew to devote their time to other tasks.<P>Support EVAs include activities such as outpost maintenance and enhancement, rover maintenance and repair, and engineering/operations detailed test objectives.<P>Exploration EVAs include activities such as geologic field work, emplacing astronomical and space physics instruments, and emplacing and operating resource utilization equipment.<P>The first week of the surface mission is characterized by transfer, move in, and start up activities...<P>The final week of the surface mission... is characterized by transitioning the assets that have been emplaced on the moon to operate in an unmanned mode and preparing items for return to Earth.<P>During the 42 day surface mission, 29 EVAs are planned with roughly 22 EVAs dedicated to exploration and seven EVAs allotted for support.<P><H4>2.1.2  Requirements</H4>The FLORG contains several specific statements which are useful in developing a crew time model.  Guidelines and assumptions include:<UL>FLO goals include establishment of a human-tended exploration capability on the Lunar surface and provision for future visits to the same outpost.  <P>Science

systems.<P>Crew health maintenance and medical care shall be provided for all crewmembers during all mission phases.<P>Crew accommodations required to support life and contribute to mission success shall be provided.<P></UL>The First Lunar Outpost Detailed Assumptions document3 provides additional, lower level requirements which were used in formulating the FLO crew time model:<P><UL>The surface segment shall provide the capability to handle all surface segment payloads after the lander element has landed on the Lunar surface.<P>The crew will visit the habitat as soon as possible after landing to verify its integrity and initiate any necessary corrective procedures.<P>A method of logistics resupply of the habitat shall be provided.<P>A method shall be provided for preparing trash for disposal.<P>It shall be possible for the habitat to be placed in a stand-by mode by one crew person in TBD hours.<P>It shall be possible for one person to operate the habitat.<P>The

no more than one hour.<P>EVAs may be performed on consecutive mission days utilizing alternate pairs of crewmembers.<P>During the first several days of the surface mission, every crew transit from the lander to the habitat involves cargo transfer, with the most critical items being carried first.<P>Limited EVAs are planned on the days surrounding local noon, EVAs occurring then will be foreshortened to accommodate the increased demand on consumables.<P>The EMU element shall require no more than one hour maintenance for every ten hours of nominal operation.<P>The PLSS element shall require no more than one (estimated) hour maintenance for every ten hours of nominal operation.<P></UL><H4>2.1.3  Additional Assumptions</H4>Other assumptions which were useful in this analysis are contained in this section of the document.<P>The outpost will contain a number of maintainable components.  It is assumed that beginning of life failures (infant mortality) will occur and be repaired during integrated system verification testing on Earth prior to outpost launch.  Therefore, outpost maintenance will reflect steady-state failure rates during the nominal crew mission.  Based on a comparison to Space Station Freedom4, the FLO habitat is assumed to include maintainable units as described in Table 2.1.3-1.<P>As a first approximation, it was further assumed that there would be no false maintenance (unneeded crew maintenance actions) and that all corrective maintenance actions are successful when the crew performs them.<P>It is assumed that the number of EVAs is to be maximized by means of crew scheduling.  It was also assumed, however, that for odd crew sizes, EVA teams would be of equal sizes and the single (odd) crewmember not assigned to an EVA team would perform IVA every day.  <P>No Lunar thermal or lighting constraints on the number of EVAs were assumed, although it is known that these will be site-dependent factors in determining when EVAs can be accomplished.<P>Health care time estimates5 which were used to generate the crew health care time allocation are shown in Table 2.1.3-2.<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=3><CAPTION>Table 2.1.3-1  FLO Surface Habitat Maintenance Parameters</CAPTION><TR><TD>Habitat intravehicular maintainable units:</TD><TD>1061</TD></TR><TR><TD>Habitat extravehicular maintainable units:</TD><TD>  197</TD></TR><TR><TD>Average mean time between failure of all units:</TD><TD>50000 hr</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><TABLE BORDER=3><CAPTION>Table 2.1.3-2  FLO Surface Habitation Phase Health Care Crew Times</CAPTION><TR><TD>Operational Health Care:</TD></TR><TR><TD>Exercise:</TD>  <TD>112 mhr, assuming 2 hr/day, 6 day/wk for crewmembers when not performing EVA or physiologic monitoring; 45 days, 32 EVAs of 2 crew and 2 EVAs of 4 crew</TD></TR><TR><TD>Private medical conference:</TD><TD>  11.25 mhr, assuming one 0.25 hr call per day, rotating among crewmembers</TD></TR><TR><TD>Physical exam:</TD><TD>  52 mhr, assuming a 2 hr exam with medical crewmember attending 3 times per mission and a 0.5 hr exam prior to leaving the habitat for the return to Earth</TD></TR><TR><TD>Physiologic Monitoring and Countermeasure Investigations:</TD><TD>	168 mhr, assuming a 3 hr session with each crewmember and a 	monitor every 5 days</TD></TR><TR></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Total:  112+11+52+168=343 mhr per surface mission</TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Average time per crewmember per day on the Lunar surface:  2.0 hr</TD></TR></TABLE><H3>2.2  Model Content</H3>The following subsections of the document address the automated tool developed to support crew time sensitivity analysis.  They discuss the model's structure, inputs, algorithms, and outputs.<P><H4>2.2.1  Structure</H4>Crew time was structured as shown in Figure 2.2.1-1 for the purposes of developing the model.  The most basic distinction made is that of crew self-maintenance versus crew work.  <P>Self-maintenance was defined to include the IVA activities necessary for the crew to survive, along with other non-work activities such as off-duty recreation.<P>Work was defined as being composed of science, maintenance, and overhead activities.  Each of these includes both an EVA and an IVA component.  Maintenance was defined as all the activities required to service and repair the outpost elements.  Overhead was defined as all the activities required to conduct the mission which are not specifically science or maintenance.  This includes items such as crew monitoring and control of the outpost elements, planning and scheduling of their activities, communication with other personnel, logistics, housekeeping, and IVA support of EVAs.<P><IMG SRC="Images/EIC012-1.GIF" WIDTH=480><P>Figure 2.2.1-1  Crew Time Model Structure<P><H4>2.2.2  Inputs</H4>The current FLO crew time model includes 26 inputs, which are structured according to the time breakdown described above.

The user inputs are arranged across the top of the page and the model outputs are at the bottom.  Ten rows of inputs and outputs are displayed simultaneously to allow the user to perform sensitivity studies on any parameters.<P>Graphical display of model inputs and outputs is also provided as illustrated in Figure 2.3-1.<P>Table 2.3-1  Crew Time Analysis Model User Interface<P><IMG SRC="Images/EIC012-2.GIF" WIDTH=480><P>Figure 2.3-1  Crew Time Analysis Model Graphical Output Sample<P><H2>3.0  Analysis Results</H2>A sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate the variation in available science time based on changes in several model input parameter values.  The inputs were varied from the default values by a factor of two in each case.  Figures 3.0-1 through 3.0-6 show the results of this analysis.<P>Figure 3.0-1 details the results of an analysis of the variation in crew time available based on changes in crew size.  The curves are defined as described in section 2.2.  Default values for all model inputs, described in section 2.1, were used while varying only crew size.  The figure illustrates the fact that a small fraction of crew time is available for useful work on the Lunar surface and that an even smaller fraction is available for scientific work.<P>Figure 3.0-2 shows a further breakdown of crew work time.  In this figure, the topmost curve is identical to the bottom curve of the previous figure.  Total science time is composed of two constituents:  IVA science time and EVA science time, which are plotted here.  It is interesting to note the variations in these two parameters based on changes in crew size.  EVA science time increases with increasing crew size except in two cases.  The first is when an additional habitat element is added to accommodate crew sizes of five to eight and crew sizes of nine to ten.  The additional maintenance time requirements of these added habitats contributes to the decrease in EVA science time.  The other contributor is the fact that the model always uses evenly sized EVA teams, composed of two crewmembers each in this analysis.  When an odd number of crewmembers is present at the outpost, IVA science time increases due to the fact that one additional IVA crewmember is present every day of the surface mission.  EVA science time does not benefit from this additional crewmember.<P>Other components of crew work time which are plotted in Figure 3.0-2 are IVA overhead, IVA maintenance, EVA maintenance, and EVA logistics.<P>Figure 3.0-3 shows the results of an analysis of the sensitivity of total science time to various model input parameters.  Each input listed on this figure was varied by a factor of two, and the resulting percent change in total science time was plotted, beginning with the most influential parameter and proceeding to the least influential parameter.  Default model input values were used for all inputs other than the one being varied in each case.  The amount of time allocated to crew sleep was the most influential parameter analyzed, because sleep takes up a large amount of overall crew time.  The model assumption is that less time allocated to sleep translates into an equal increase in crew science time, which may be an over-simplification of the real case.  Stay time and crew size are shown to be highly influential determiners of crew science time, as well.  It is interesting to note that the number of days between EVAs for each crewmember is not highly influential on available science time.  This is true if, as assumed in the model, crewmembers who are not performing EVA science are performing IVA science.  In this case, total science time, the parameter analyzed here, is not greatly affected by the proportion of EVA and IVA science times.<P>This result is further analyzed in Figure 3.0-4.  Here the number of days between EVAs for each crewmember was varied from zero to three.  Again it is seen that total science time is not greatly influenced, while the proportion of EVA and IVA science times vary greatly, as expected.<P>Figures 3.0-5 and 3.0-6 show the results of further analysis of the relationship between EVA and IVA science times.  In Figure 3.0-5, the length of an EVA period is varied from four to ten hours, and the effects on science times are shown.  Total science time is somewhat affected, while IVA and EVA science times are greatly affected, as expected.  The modeling assumption is that shortened EVA periods translate directly into added IVA science time, which again is an over-simplification of the real case.<P>Figure 3.0-6 shows the results of varying the number of crewmembers on each EVA team.  For a crew size of four, it is seen that an EVA team size of three is distinctly disadvantageous when maximizing EVA time, when coupled with the requirement that EVA crewmembers must have an IVA day between each two EVA periods.  Total science time is seen to be relatively independent of the EVA team size because IVA crewmembers are assumed to perform science as well.<P>Figure 3.0-1  Time on Lunar Surface Versus Crew Size<P>Figure 3.0-2  Work Times Versus Crew Size<P>Figure 3.0-3  Sensitivity of Total Science Time to Model Inputs<P>Figure 3.0-4  Science Times versus Number of Days Between EVAs<P>Figure 3.0-5  Science Times versus Length of EVA Period<P>Figure 3.0-6  Science Times versus Number of Crewmembers on EVA<P><H2>4.0  Conclusions</H2><H3>4.1  Programmatic</H3>Definitions of FLO terms are needed, including crew time terminology.  A particular crew time structure and set of terms has been used in this study, but other studies have used different structures and terms.  Common terminology which is accepted by the program would be useful in future work.<P>Integrated study of FLO crew time is important to plan and manage this resource.  All the elements of crew time must be integrated in order to make informed decisions on what objectives may be accomplished within a given length of surface mission with a given crew size.<P>Results of crew time sensitivity analysis may be useful in writing FLO operations concepts and plans.  Very often, in developing these plans, quantitative data is useful in selecting a particular operational approach.  Relative effects of varying operational parameters can be used to develop the rationale for selection of one approach over other possible approaches.<P><H3>4.2  Mission</H3>Science time is extremely sensitive to the amount of crew time needed for operating the outpost.  Operational overhead, logistics, and corrective maintenance may impose a significant burden on crew time.  Methods to offload some of this activity from the crewmembers may be useful in maintaining a viable amount of science activity.<P>The choice of an odd versus even number of crewmembers is important in the FLO EVA context.  The desire to maximize the amount of crew EVA time coupled with the idea that EVAs include two crewmembers and that each crewmember have an IVA day between EVAs results in a distinctive advantage in having an even number of crewmembers.<P><H3>4.3  Future Work</H3>The crew time analysis performed to date has been at a high level and has not considered several aspects of the FLO mission:<P><UL>	<LI> transit phases	<LI> contingencies and aborts	<LI> sequencing of crew activities.</UL>Each of these areas represents potential future work which should be performed when the FLO study reaches the point of needing that information.<P>Integration of the crew time model into a larger mission/system effectiveness model may be useful in order to optimize not only crew time availability but also development variables such as system mass, cost, schedule, and risk.<P><H2>5.0  References</H2>1.
