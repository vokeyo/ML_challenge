  </CENTER>

      <P>
  <font  FACE="HELVETICA"  COLOR=#000000 size=+1>  As the climatological height of the Atlantic hurricane season draws near, the second
Category 5 hurricane of the year has just made landfall.  Almost two weeks to the day
since Hurricane Dean, the first Category 5 storm of the season, made landfall in the
Yucatan Peninsula, Hurricane Felix came ashore on the northeast coast of Nicaragua
with sustained winds of 160 mph.   <P> 
  <A HREF ="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_rain/Events/felix_forming_28aug07_0610_utc.jpg">

</a> 

The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (or TRMM) satellite captured this unique series
of images, which chronicle the development of Felix from an unnamed disturbance to a
powerful hurricane.  Launched back in November of 1997, TRMM is armed with an array of
passive and active sensors designed to measure rainfall and its structure from space.
It has proven itself to be an excellent platform for observing tropical cyclones.  The
first image was taken by TRMM at 06:10 UTC (2:10 am EDT) on the 28th of August 2007 and
shows the horizontal pattern of rain associated with a tropical disturbance located
midway between the coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles.  At this stage, there is no
evidence of a circulation.  The system does not yet show any signs of organization and
is best described as a loose cluster of storms with mostly light to moderate rain (blue
and green areas, respectively) associated with a tropical easterly wave propagating away
from Africa.  Rain rates in the center of the swath are from the TRMM PR, and those in
the outer swath come from the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI).  The rain rates are overlaid
on infrared (IR) data from the TRMM Visible Infrared Scanner (VIRS).
<P>
 <A HREF ="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_rain/Events/felix_forming_30aug07_1545utc.jpg">

</a>

The second image was taken two days later at 15:45 UTC (11:45 am EDT) on the 30th.  Not
unlike the first image, the disturbance still shows no signs of organization other than
that the area of associated rain is somewhat more consolidated.  It would be another
full day before the disturbance developed a closed circulation, identifying it as a
tropical depression (TD #6, the sixth tropical depression of the season).  At this point,
the system was already approaching the Windward Islands just 180 miles to its west.  Over
the next day, TD #6 continued to organize and gather strength.  By midday on September
1st, it had become a tropical storm and was given the name Felix.
<P>
 

This next image shows Felix just after being named a tropical storm.  It was taken at
15:30 UTC (11:30 am EDT) on 1 September.  The organization is now clearly evident with
rain bands spiraling around a central point (arcs of green and blue denoting moderate
and light intensity rain, respectively). <A HREF ="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_rain/Events/felix_1sep07_1530utc.jpg">
<img src ="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_rain/Events/felix_1sep07_1530utc_small.gif"
 align=right  height=358 width=350  alt=" Link to image of tropical storm felix  "  HSPACE=0 VSPACE=0>
</a>  This central point is associated with an
area of low pressure and marks the center of the storm's circulation.  At the time of
this image, sustained winds were reported at 55 knots (63 mph) by the National Hurricane
Center (NHC) based on aircraft reports.  At this stage, warm sea surface temperatures and
low atmospheric wind shear made conditions ideal for continued development.  As a result,
Felix steadily intensified, becoming a hurricane later that same day.  A deep-layer
ridge to the north of the system continued to steer the system due west.  This put Felix
on track parallel to but south of that previously taken by Dean.  Dean moved pretty much
due west through the northern Caribbean, while Felix moved due west through the southern
Caribbean.
<P>
<A HREF ="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_rain/Events/felix_3sep07_1513_utc.jpg">

align=right  height=358 width=350  alt=" Link to image of hurricane felix  "  HSPACE=0 VSPACE=0>
</a> 
By daybreak on the 2nd, Felix was up to Category 2 intensity with sustained winds of 85
knots (98 mph).  Felix then underwent a period of rapid deepening and quickly intensified.
By nightfall, Felix was a very powerful storm, a Category 5 storm with sustained winds of 
145 knots (167 mph).  This next image from TRMM was taken at 15:13 UTC (11:13 am EDT) on
the 3rd and shows Category 5 Felix as it was moving due west through the western Caribbean
in the direction of Nicaragua.  The storm is very compact and tightly wound with good
banding and sharply curving rain bands.  However, the storm is a little asymmetric as
evidenced by the larger amount of heavy (dark red areas) to moderate rain being north and
east of the center.  In fact, Felix underwent a period of weakening after this image was
taken.

 align=right height=442 width=432  alt=" Link to image of hurricane felix  "  HSPACE=0 VSPACE=0>
</a>
The final image was taken at 06:04 UTC (2:04 am EDT) on the 4th and shows Felix bearing
down on the coast of Nicaragua.  Felix had regained its Category 5 status and winds were
back up to 135 knots (155 mph).  The eye is very small, and the center is well-defined.
Intense rain occupies the western eye wall (dark red arc), and tightly-curved concentric
rain bands surround the center, indicating a very intense circulation.  Felix is a small
storm.  As such, it is can change intensity fairly quickly in response to environmental
conditions.  The storm is expected to quickly weaken over land.  The last great hurricane
to impact the region was Hurricane Mitch back in 1998.  Mitch killed over 11,000 people
in Central America with thousands more missing mostly as a result of massive flooding.

The image above is a color contoured perspective 3-D image of the 
rainfall that occurred over Central America during the 
period from August 30 to September 6, 2007 when hurricane 
Felix traveled across the Caribbean and into Central America. All of the precipitation isn't due to hurricane Felix. For example the heavy precipitation over Costa Rica is caused by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).
This image was made using TRMM based merged satellite micro-wave 
and Infrared data (3B42).
