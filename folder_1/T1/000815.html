DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

National Park Service

 
Notice of Inventory Completion: Texas Archeological Research 
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX

AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the 
completion of an inventory of human remains in the possession of the 
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at 
Austin, Austin, TX. The human remains were removed from 2 sites in 
Caddo and Sabine Parishes, LA, and 54 sites in 19 counties of 
northeastern Texas.
    This notice is published as part of the National Park Service's 
administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). 
The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the 
museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native 
American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National 
Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.
    A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Texas 
Archeological Research Laboratory professional staff in consultation 
with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.

Caddo Parish, LA

    In July 1960, human remains representing one individual were 
removed from the Belcher Mound site near Shreveport by amateur 
archeologist Ray Ring. Mr. Ring found the bone fragment between Mounds 
A and B after the mounds had been leveled by machinery following the 
well-known excavations by Clarence Webb from 1936 to 1954. No known 
individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.
    The Belcher site is a dual mound and habitation site that 
functioned as a ceremonial center and cemetery between circa A.D. 900-
1700. The human remains and associated funerary objects removed from 
the site by Mr. Webb were affiliated with the Caddo Indian Tribe of 
Oklahoma based on mortuary practices and ceramic styles. A notice of 
inventory completion was published in the Federal Register on December 
13, 2000.

Sabine Parish, LA

    In 1962, 1963, and 1965, human remains representing a minimum of 
six individuals were removed from the Salt Lick site (16SA37A) during 
excavations by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project at the 
University of Texas, prior to construction of the Toledo Bend 
Reservoir. No known individuals were identified. The 13 associated 
funerary objects are 12 pottery vessels and 1 ceramic pipe.
    The Salt Lick site was a Prehistoric period cemetery containing 10 
graves. The human remains found in four graves were poorly preserved 
and were not removed. Burials 1 through 6 were shallow, flexed, and in 
random orientation. Burials 7 through 10 were deep, extended, and 
similarly oriented. The consistency of the associated funerary objects 
among the 10 burials, however, suggests that they were contemporaneous.
    The location of the cemetery on land historically occupied by the 
Caddo Indians, mode of interment, and nature of the associated funerary 
objects indicate that the human remains and associated funerary objects 
are culturally affiliated with the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.

Anderson County, TX

    In 1935, human remains representing one individual were removed 
from the Isibell-Gene Donnell site (41AN14) by the University of Texas 
after relic collectors had located the Prehistoric period cemetery and 
habitation area. No known individual was identified. The 11 associated 
funerary objects are 7 pottery vessels and 4 arrow points.
    In 1931, human remains representing one individual were removed 
from the Emma Owens Farm site (41AN21) by the University of Texas. A 
known Caddo habitation area was located nearby. No known individual was

remains from three graves were poorly preserved and were left in place. 
No known individual was identified. The two associated funerary objects 
are pottery vessels.
    In 1930, human remains representing one individual were removed 
from the E.W. Ellis Farm site (41AN36) by the landowner and were later 
donated to the University of Texas. The grave was determined to be an 
isolated Prehistoric period burial. No known individual was identified. 
No associated funerary objects are present.
    In 1934 and 1935, human remains representing three individuals were 
removed from the O.L. Ellis Farm site (41AN54). Unknown relic 
collectors located the Prehistoric period cemetery and excavated two 
graves. The human remains from one grave were donated to the University 
of Texas. The University of Texas later excavated another two graves. 
No known individuals were identified. The 20 associated funerary 
objects are 17 pottery vessels, 13 of which were purchased from the 
original collectors, 1 scraper, 1 mano, and 1 projectile point.
    In 1929, human remains representing a minimum of one individual 
were removed from a Prehistoric period grave on the Lee Ellis Farm 
(41AN56) by the landowner. In 1931, the University of Texas purchased

was identified. The two associated funerary objects are one arrow point 
and one pottery vessel.

Bowie County, TX

    In 1932, human remains representing nine individuals were removed 
from the Eli Moore site (41BW2) by the University of Texas. Eight of 
the individuals were removed from one of two mounds at the Prehistoric 
period site; the other individual had been disturbed by plowing a short 
distance from the mounds. It has been determined after examination by 
numerous physical anthropologists that one additional interment was 
intrusive into the mound and that the human

[[Page 1271]]

remains are not those of a Native American. The site is believed to be 
part of an Upper Nasoni village visited frequently by European 
explorers in the late 1600s and 1700s. The Texas Archeological Research 
Laboratory is in possession of human remains representing six Native 
American individuals from the Eli Moore site. The location of the human 
remains of the other three Native American individuals is not known. No

site is also considered to be a part of the Upper Nasoni village 
visited by several European explorers. No known individuals were 
identified. No associated funerary objects are present from the 1932 
excavation. The 174 associated funerary objects from the latter 
excavation are 111 pottery vessels, 52 beads, 3 ceramic pipes, 3 mussel 
shells, 2 turtle shells, 2 bone needles, and 1 shell gorget.

of the graves were poorly preserved and not removed. No known 
individual was identified. The three associated funerary objects are 
two mussel shells and one dart point.
    In 1930, human remains representing one individual were removed 
from the J.H. Reese Farm site (41WD2) by the University of Texas. The 
human remains from two other burials were poorly preserved and not 
removed. The three Prehistoric period burials had been unearthed and 
reburied previously by the landowner. No known individual was 
identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Funerary 
objects were purchased by the university from the landowner, but they 
cannot be specifically associated with the recovered human remains.
    In 1931, human remains representing two individuals were removed 
from the Prehistoric period H.D. Spigner Farm site (41WD4) by the 
University of Texas. No known individuals were identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. The landowner retained 
possession of the human remains and funerary objects from three other 
graves that had been unearthed previously.
    Historical evidence and oral history indicate that a large area of 
northeast Texas, including the counties encompassing the 56 sites 
described above, is part of the traditional territory of the Caddo 
people. Archeological, historical, and oral history evidence indicates 
that settlements within this region exhibit a cultural continuity 
dating from circa A.D. 1000 and continuing into the Historic period. 
Cultural affiliation with the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma is also based on 
the nature of the sites from which the human remains were obtained, the 
mode of interment, the kinds of associated funerary objects, including 
whole pottery vessels, and the cranial

[[Page 1274]]

deformation exhibited in some of the human remains.
    Officials of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory have 
determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains 
described above represent the physical remains of a minimum of 308 
individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Texas 
Archeological Research Laboratory also have determined that, pursuant 
to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the 8,083 objects described above are 
reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human 
remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or 
ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Texas Archeological Research 
Laboratory have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there 
is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably 
traced between the Native American human remains and the Caddo Nation 
of Oklahoma.
    Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to 
be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary 
objects should contact Dr. Darrell Creel, Director, Texas Archeological 
Research Laboratory, 1 University Station, R7500, The University of 
Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712-0714, telephone (512) 471-5960, 
before February 7, 2005. Repatriation of the human remains to the Caddo 
Nation of Oklahoma may proceed after that date if no additional 
claimants come forward.
    The Texas Archeological Research Laboratory is responsible for
