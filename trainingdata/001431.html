<br>
SafeStat (short for Motor Carrier Safety Status Measurement System) is an automated, data driven analysis 
system designed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).&nbsp;&nbsp;SafeStat combines current 
and historical carrier-based safety performance information to measure the relative (peer-to-peer) 
safety fitness of interstate commercial motor carriers and intrastate commercial motor carriers that 
transport hazardous materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;This information includes Federal and State data on crashes, roadside 
inspections, on-site compliance review results and enforcement history.&nbsp;&nbsp;SafeStat enables FMCSA to 
quantify and monitor the safety status of individual motor carriers on a monthly basis and thereby focus 
enforcement resources on carriers posing the greatest potential safety risk.
<br><br>

<strong style="font-weight: 400">The States are required to provide standard, basic information about large truck and bus crashes 
to FMCSA within 90 days of the crash event, and the results of roadside inspections within 21 days of 
inspection.  However, the completeness, timeliness and accuracy of crash data &#150; and to a lesser 
extent roadside inspection data &#150; vary from state-to-state.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, SafeStat&#146;s ability 
to accurately and objectively assess the safety fitness of individual motor carriers may be inconsistent 
and not conclusive without additional analysis.  </strong>
<br><br>
<b><u>Temporary Removal of Accident Safety Evaluation Area (SEA) and Overall SafeStat Score</u> </b><br>
FMCSA has temporarily removed the motor carrier Accident SEA and Overall SafeStat Scores
 from its Analysis &amp; Information Online (A&amp;I) Web site while the agency works with its
  State partners to improve the timeliness, completeness and accuracy of large truck
   and bus safety data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Carriers can still access their own Accident SEA and Overall
    SafeStat Scores.
