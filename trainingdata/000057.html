      <P>Of the Sahaptian there are agreed, by most linguists, to be
      two divisions of concern here. The Northern Sahaptians of the
      northern part of the state, and the Lutuamian of southern Oregon
      which contains the Modoc and Klamath. First to be dealt with
      will be the Northern Sahaptian.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica">Northern
      Sahaptian: Tenino</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#008000"> </FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT
      NOSHADE SIZE="5"></P>

      <P>Along the south bank of the Columbia from the Wasco on the
      west to the Umatilla on the east, and on the lower reaches of
      the Deschutes and John Day Rivers, were the Tenino. There were
      four subdivisions each with a pair of villages - one for summer
      and one for winter. The summertime village was a rather flimsy
      one along a river. The wintertime villages were more permanent
      and several miles away from the rivers.</P>

      <P>The four subdivisions of the Tenino were the Tenino Proper
      who spent their summers four miles east of The Dalles and their
      winters six miles inland, the Wyam or Deschutes who summered-
      at Celilo and wintered on the best bank of the Deschutes near
      its confluence with the Columbia, the John Day who had both their
      summer and winter villages on the John Day River not far from
      the Columbia, and the Tyghwho were an offshoot from the Tenino
      Proper and whose winter village was at Tygh Valley and summer
      village was at Sherar's Bridge on the Deschutes (Murdock 1938:395-396).</P>

      <P>The Tenino had no social stratification, and chieftainship
      was not inherited. It helped to be wealthy to attain chieftainship,
      but it was not a prerequisite. The power of a chief depended
      on the respect and influence he could muster. The Tenino villages
      were autonomous politically, but not culturally. The Tenino traveled
      throughout the year in order to exploit various resources, such
      as fish, roots, berries, and game (Suphan 1974b:27).</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica">Northern
      Sahaptian: Molala</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#008000"> </FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT
      NOSHADE SIZE="5"></P>

      <P>The Molala were at one time immediately west of the Tenino.
      They were linguistically different, but cultural similar, to
      the Tenino. They did not have slaves, however. Before an offshoot
      of the Tenino Proper, the Tygh, ran them out they inhabited only
      one summer village at Tygh Valley and a winter village at Sherar's
      Bridge on the Deschutes (Murdock 1938:397). Joel Berreman (1937:44-45)
      believes it was the Northern Paiute who pushed them west. They
      apparently were moved, by whatever group (probably the Tenino),
      west of the Cascade Mountains.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica">Northern
      Sahaptian: Umatilla</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#008000"> </FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT
      NOSHADE SIZE="5"></P>

      <P>East of the Tenino, along the lower Umatilla River and adjacent
      to the south bank of the Columbia River, lived the Umatilla (Berreman
      1927:61). They also lived on the north bank of the Columbia (Ray
      1938: 385). According to Verne Ray (1939:11) they tended to lean
      comparatively close to a tribal structure, but many argue that
      this was only true in the historic times (Suphan 1974a:107).
      One criteria Ray uses for his statement is that virtually all
      the Umatilla met in one village at the mouth of the Umatilla
      at a time in the winter (1939:12). Most authors say they had
      no tribal chiefs and villages were autonomous politically. Their
      chiefs were picked on the basis of achievement (Ray 1939:18).
      There was no class stratification based on wealth, but they did
      rank according to war honors with the counting of coup being
      important (Ray 1939:43). The Plains influence was quite strong
      among the Umatilla. Like most Plateau groups they had permanent
      villages for winter and traveled the rest of the year to obtain
      various resources. Most Plateau groups lived in mat covered lodges
      or semisubterranean houses and, in later times, the tipi in the
      winter, and in temporary mat or brush shelters in the summer.</P>

      Sahaptian: Cayuse</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#008000"> </FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT
      NOSHADE SIZE="5"></P>

      <P>Around the headwaters of streams that flowed into the Columbia,
      the Walla Walla, Umatilla and Grande Ronde Rivers, roughly east
      of the Umatilla are the Cayuse. With this tribe, as well as with
      the Umatilla and Wallawalla, Verne Ray says that they had a tribal
      structure (1939: 11). Robert J. Suphan disagrees (1974a 107).
      Ray says the name &quot;Cayuse&quot; applies to an ethnic group
      rather than a tribe, however (Ray 1939:12). The Cayuse are quite
      close to the Nez Perce structure of social organization which
      will be discussed below. According to many historians the Cayuse
      were somewhat more violent and warlike than the Nez Perce, and
      they cite the Whitman Massacre as an example. Much of this can
      be attributed to the fact that in the historical period they
      were right on the Oregon Trail. The Cayuse place emphasis on
      ranking war honors and resemble the Plains complex. There were
      no castes or classes. They were typical Plateau in that most
      of the time they had autonomous villages with their own chiefs,
      and traveled out of permanent winter villages in the warmer months
      to exploit upland resources. They lived in typical Plateau dwellings.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica">Northern
      Sahaptian: Nez Perce</FONT></B> <HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE SIZE="5"></P>

      <P>The Nez Perce to the North and east of the Cayuse, were a
      large and important group. Though they lived mainly in Idaho,
      a large portion of northeastern Oregon was occupied by them.
      In fact, a band living-in Oregon's Wallowa Valley were the most
      famous of the Nez Perce. At least five bands had winter villages
      in Oregon: 1) the Imnama on the Imnaha River, 2) the Walwama
      on the Wallowa River, 3) the Inantoinu that lived on Joseph Creek,
      4) the Koiknimapu who resided above Joseph Creek on the Grande
      Ronde River, and 5) the Isawisnemepu who were near present Zindels
      on the Grande Ronde River (Spinden 1908:174-175). The Nez Perce
      as a whole called themselves the Numipu, but that name was never
      used by outsiders. The name &quot;Nez Perce&quot; is of French
      origin translated from a Siouan term meaning &quot;pierced nose&quot;
      (Spinden 1908:171-172).</P>

      <P>The Nez Perce lived in typical Plateau semisubterranean and
      mat dwellings. They traveled in the spring, summer, and fall
      months for fish, game, roots' and berries in the higher elevations
      where it was cool. They lived in the lower river valleys in the
      winter. The camas root was a principle staple and they also relief
      heavily on river resources such as fish and mussels.</P>

      <P>As with most of the Northern Sahaptian, warfare was important.
      The Nez Perce, though not excessively warlike, stood guard against
      the Shoshonian speakers in the east and south. Each village had
      its own chief, but villages would meet in times of war or to
      collect a certain resource such as buffalo. Chieftainship was
      based on achievement. There were peace chiefs in each village
      and, in times of war, war chiefs would become effective. These
      war chiefs could command a group of villages or, on rare occasions,
      the whole Nez Perce stock. Such war command was relinquished
      in times of peace. The power of a war chief was only honorary
      during peace. There were both tribal and village councils. Personal
      matters such as murder and adultery were left up to the families
      to handle. As with most Plateau cultures the individual owned
      tools and implements, while sites and territory were &quot;owned&quot;
      by the village or stock.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica">Northern
      Sahaptian: Klicitat and Wallawalla</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#008000">
      </FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE SIZE="5"></P>

      <P>Writers such as Berreman (1937) feel that Sahaptians such
      as the Klicitat to the north lived in Oregon at one time and
      were pushed north into Washington by Shoshonean speakers. Ray
      (1938), on the other hand, feels that this was not true. The
      Wallawalla, who were closely related to the Cayuse and Umatilla,
      reside mainly in Washington, but some sources feel that they
      may have lived partially in Oregon, also.</P>

      <P>For the most part the Northern Sahaptians coexisted peacefully
      with each other and with the Interior Salish to the north, but
      were enemies with Shoshonean speakers to the south. The groups
      to the east of the state were more Plains-like. The influence
      of the horse and Plains culture in the 18th century, modified
      all Plateau peoples by giving greater mobility and new traits.</P>

      <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="50%"></P>

      <P>The Klamath and the Modoc belonged to the Lutuamian division
      of the Sahaptian stock. They occupied the south-central part
      of Oregon near and across the California border.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica">Lutuamian:
      Klamath</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#008000"> </FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT
      NOSHADE SIZE="5"></P>

      <P>The Klamath were the larger of the two divisions of the Lutuamian.
      They occupied the territory west to the Cascade Mountains, north
      to about the 44th parallel, east to the drainage of Sycan Marsh
      and a portion of the drainage of Goose Lake, and south to about
      the present California-Oregon border (Curtis 1907:13:161). In
      the winter they lived in semisubterranean houses. They also traveled
      throughout the warmer months to gather various resources. The
      seed of the Yellow Water Lilly (Wokas) was a good staple. They
      also exploited berries, other seeds, roots, fish, waterfowl,
      and game.</P>

      <P>There were several subdivisions, each with its own chief or
      headman (Curtis, 1907:13:175; Ray 1939:6). Among these were:
      1) the Klamath-Marsh-Williamson River group on the southern margin
      of the Klamath Marsh and lower Williamson and Sprague Rivers
      (43 villages), 2) the Agency Lake group on Agency Lake and the
      northern arm of Klamath Lake (one village), 3) the Lower Williamson
      River group close to the mouth of the Williamson River (5 villages),
      4) the Pelican Bay group in the Pelican Bay district on the west
      side of Klamath Lake, Four Mile Creek, and the marsh north of
      the Lake (9 villages), and 5) the Klamath Falls group along Klamath
      Lake south of Modoc Point (18 villages) (Berreman 1937:43). Though
      not linked politically, these bands were linked culturally. Chieftainship
      was achieved and most chiefs were rich though wealth was not
      the basis by which they were chosen. The family was the basic
      unit of society (Curtis 1907:13:175) According to Ray (1963:134)
      the Modoc and Klamath were often allies in raiding people to
      the south and did not fight each other. Curtis (1907:13:162)
      implies they did fight each other, but this statement is probably
      based on conflict caused when the government placed both on the
      same reservation in an unnatural situation for the two tribes.</P>

      <P>The Klamath traded slaves with tribes to the north such as
      the Wasco. They kept slaves themselves, but these prisoners were
      merely adopted into families and could marry Klamath.</P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica">Lutuamian:
      Modoc</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#008000"> </FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT
      NOSHADE SIZE="5"></P>

      <P>The Modoc were the other and the smaller of the Lutuamian
      division. Though they had some conflict with the Klamath before
      the Modoc War of the 1870s, they were generally allies and had
      similar cultures. They lived chiefly in California to the south
      and east of the Klamath. Two bands in Oregon were on the Upper
      Lost River above Olene, and the Lower Lost River (Berreman 1937:44).
      Tribal organization in the political sense was lacking in the
      Modoc, with each band or village having its own chief. There
      were three types of leadership in Modoc society as with many
      other Plateau-type groups (e.g. Nez Perce). These were leadership
      in warfare, religion, and domestic affairs (Ray 1963:3). Achievement
      was the basis on which these were usually chosen. The highest
      legal authority was the village assembly (Ray 1953:9). Homicide
      and personal matters were a concern to the chief but were to
      be handled for the most part by the families involved.</P>

      <P>The Modoc traveled in warm months on their annual food quest.
      They dismantled their winter homes in villages, only leaving
      the main poles standing, and upon their return they usually rebuilt
      the house over the wind cleaned pit (Ray 1963:180).</P>
