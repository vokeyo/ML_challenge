<B>T</B>he relentless march of technology has never been lost
on the U.S. military and often has been the cause for dramatic
revision and occasional wholesale scrapping of military doctrine.
Students of military history enthusiastically debate which innovation
has had the most profound effect on warfare. Was it the breech-loading
rifle, which allowed a soldier to reload his weapon from the prone
position? Or was it the machinegun, which eliminated the need
for single-shot accuracy by providing a blistering volume of fire?
It may even have been the helicopter, which required the development
of new tactics for vertical assault because of its ability to
shower the landing zone from above with combat-ready troops.
<P>
Someday in the distant future, however, historians may review
the annals of conflict and conclude that the most resounding change
to the manner in which war is waged was caused by that unimposing
device sitting on your desk: the computer. Twenty years of hardware
and software development have brought exponential growth in computer
technology, and the military has done well to capitalize on that
growth. In general, a computer does things faster, more efficiently,
and with greater accuracy than does a human with a pencil, a slide
rule, and a pocket protector. A computer doesn't sleep, doesn't
eat, doesn't complain, and, for the most part, never forgets.
Volumes of information can be stored in minimal space. A computer
can nestle in the nose cone of a missile, guiding it with precision
to a target as small as the third-story window of a specific building,
and it can store the lift data of an entire corps in its memory
banks.
<P>
The military has embraced, invested in, and, perhaps unwittingly,
sold its soul to the computer. Blinded by amazement over the computer's
miraculous capabilities, we often overlook a lingering question:
Can we ever fight again without it?
<P>
<B>Technological Trends</B> 
<P>
Awestruck logisticians may have been led down a tenuous path by
the misapplication of developments and the misinterpretation of
their benefits. As a result, I see three technological trends
in today's combat service support (CSS) community, each one a
natural, harmless thing in itself, but potentially destructive
when combined.
<P>
First, we have replaced &quot;manual logistics&quot; with technology.
Gone are the days of number crunching and bean counting; systems
do this for us now, and they do it faster and better. Computers
have automated the loading of ships and planes, the requisitioning
of supplies and equipment, and the tracking of transportation
assets across the globe. Information systems have even begun to
quicken the materiel acquisition process. Logisticians can save
valuable time and money by using accurate estimates based on sound
data that have been integrated and manipulated by a computer.
In the combat environment, a well-founded estimate virtually ensures
the right support at the right time at the right place.
<P>
The second technological trend in today's CSS community is the
tendency of staff officers and commanders to make operational
decisions based on computer-generated information. Of all the
technological innovations, the availability of real-time information
has had the most dramatic effect on the decisionmaking process.
Commanders and staff officers now are able to quantify many battlefield
unknowns and incorporate these figures into immediate decisions
and future plans. In his July-August 1995 <I>Army Logistician</I>
article, &quot;Pipeline Vision for Force XXI,&quot; Major General
Thomas W. Robison, then commander of the Army Combined Arms Support
Command, wrote that, &quot;Digitization will provide each logistics
echelon with situational awareness of the maneuver commander's
location and logistics requirements. The logistics community will
be able to forecast where logistics supply distribution points
and CSS facilities need to be in 24 to 48 hours.&quot; Current,
accessible, and accurate information at the fingertips of planners
will enhance the precision and economy of CSS.
<P>
The third technological trend in the CSS community is a natural
follow-on to its predecessors: The training environment focuses
increasingly on the system operator's proficiency at his keyboard
tasks. With every leap in software capabilities comes the need
for complementary skills in personnel. A system without a qualified
operator is useless. The military's training emphasis must be
placed first on teaching operators basic computer literacy, competency
in operation of a particular system, and skill at higher levels
of data manipulation. This training must occur within the limits
of shrinking budgets and diminishing school seats. Then the military's
training focus should shift to teaching the logistician how to
make an information system work for him and to take action based
on the output of that system.
<P>
Computers, however, might not be the panacea we've built them
up to be. They are sensitive, vulnerable machines, easily susceptible
to incidental and battlefield damage. They require a substantial
and constant power distribution system and a communications network
capable of transmitting data from the fighting field, across the
communications zone, to the continental United States. The whims
of nature can disable an entire system with heat, cold, dust,
or moisture. An advanced enemy may have the ability to embed viruses
in a network, causing infections at every node.
<P>
Perhaps the most frustrating of all vulnerabilities, however,
is the computer's reliance on human input. A computer system accepts
bad information as readily as accurate information. Heavy reliance
on computer technology in planning and execution can be exacerbated
by a heightened training focus on logistics systems rather than
logistics skills. This inevitably leads to a costly result: a
vulnerable support network managed by a generation of staff officers
and logistics commanders who lack a solid foundation in CSS principles
and their execution in combat. Outside the sterile environment
of battle labs and simulation exercises, undertrained logisticians
may find themselves at the mercy of their computer screens. The
heated cauldron of warfare is no place to scramble about in ignorance
when those screens go blank.
<P>
<B>The Price of Technology</B> 
<P>
I believe that the CSS community's headlong rush to integrate
computer technology into all potential aspects of support at the
expense of developing skilled logisticians may leave us open to
two dangerous possibilities.
<P>
First, we are threatened with <I>timidity</I>. Gone will be the
courage to act boldly on an instinct that comes from a leader's
close contact with the tempo of battle. The computer will select
a course of action and tell us where to place our support and
when to take action. If most of our faith is placed in the system
and not in the skill, we will defer to the computer.
<P>
Consider, for example, the combat service support control system
(CSSCS) discussed by Lieutenant Colonel Michael P. Kelley in his
article, &quot;CSSCS Proven in Support Operations,&quot; in the
July-August 1995 issue of <I>Army Logistician</I>. With 17 CSSCS
computers operating throughout the brigade, division support command,
and division staff, this system is designed to process and disseminate
critical logistics information from the brigade combat team all
the way to echelons above corps. The CSSCS can maintain asset
visibility, produce automated reports, manage transportation assets,
and improve situational awareness. When fully functional, CSSCS
will digitize the battlefield dramatically, and could &quot;revolutionize&quot;
staff procedures and planning cycles.
<P>
But what would happen if those previously discussed vulnerabilities
rendered the system ineffective, or a wily enemy capitalized on
a breach in security? In the event that CSSCS goes down, even
for a moment, logistics leaders must be capable of instantaneously
shifting to an alternate means of maintaining seamless support
to the combat commanders. Failure to do so would violate continuity,
a vital logistics principle. The closer one gets to the fight,
the more imperative continuous support becomes. If the logistician
pins his hopes on a system, and that system crashes at the crucial
hour, his only fallback will be his skills and those of his team
members. Repeatedly taught, well-honed logistics skills will compensate
for the loss of a system's capabilities. Fundamental, proven skills
can combine with a deliberate understanding of the battle tempo
to ensure continuity and uninterrupted support.
<P>
If leaders fail to teach, sharpen, and test such skills in peace,
the skills will be tragically lacking in war. Creative logistics
strategies and the strength of character to employ them will become
things of the past. Tenacity, innovation, and the courage to take
risks will fall victim to a blinking cursor. If logistics leaders
do not develop strong, capable, and open minds in their subordinates,
they will have discarded the finest weapon in our wartime arsenal.
<P>
The second potential hazard of imprudent integration of technology
is a <I>dwindling sense of leadership and accountability. </I>If
there is already a tendency to let the computer fight the battle
and make critical decisions, then the computer has been given
a disproportionate role in the hierarchy of command. If judgments
are made based on information analyzed and manipulated by a system,
it will be human nature also to blame that system for poor decisions
or plans gone awry. A combat logistician who allows his tactical
life to be dictated by a video display terminal has abdicated
his responsibility as a leader. Instead of attempting the difficult
or suggesting the unpopular, he can point to the computer and
state with conviction that he acted in good faith and that the
<I>system</I> let him and the unfortunate foot soldiers down.
<P>
The burdens of leadership and command must not be delegated to
a system or a network. These responsibilities must be borne squarely
on the shoulders of the leader. Accepting them involves the logistician
in what is at stake, personalizes his recommendations to the commander,
and makes him ultimately responsible for his words and deeds.
There can be no compromise in this; warfare is far too deadly
an endeavor for anything less than absolute leadership.
<P>
<B>Judicious Integration of Technology</B> 
<P>
At this point, it may seem that my &quot;technophobia&quot; would
dictate that the only acceptable weapon system for our arsenal
is a smooth stone in a rawhide sling, but that is is not true.
The benefits of technological innovations are undeniable. These
innovations should be integrated wisely into military doctrine.
But this integration must occur with respect for the skills it
enhances, never at the price of replacing them. We teach hand-to-hand
fighting in case the rifle jams; similarly, we must teach logistics
skills in case the computer crashes. To neglect either of these
fundamentals is to leave our people unprepared for combat, and
that is a mortal injustice.
<P>
Technology must be incorporated with patience and wisdom. Its
impact on the battlefield must be dissected and examined and its
deficiencies exposed and overcome in peacetime. Personnel must
be thoroughly versed in &quot;the old way&quot; of doing business
before they can appreciate and benefit from a new system. Leaders
must be developed in the most demanding and arduous of environments.
Their hearts and minds must be molded and tempered for the brutal
stresses combat will inflict upon them. Technology, no matter
how amazing its capabilities, will never replace leadership, never
outdate the rigid posture of command, and never replace the man
who can think for himself. <B>ALOG</B>
