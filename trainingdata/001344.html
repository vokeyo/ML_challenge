<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3.3  Properties of Hydrogeologic Units </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The hydrogeologic system at the Yucca Mountain Site consists of a sequence of Tertiary and older rocks that includes an unsaturated zone as much as 750 m (2,500 feet) thick, underlain by a saturated zone that includes as much as 1,500 m (4,570 feet) of Tertiary rocks and probably a greater thickness of transmissive Paleozoic rocks.  In general, the unsaturated zone may include Quaternary and Tertiary alluvium and colluvium deposits that are underlain by Tertiary welded and nonwelded volcanic rocks of the Timber Mountain, Paintbrush, and Crater Flat Groups, including the Rainier Mesa Tuff, the Tiva Canyon Tuff, the Topopah Springs Tuff, the Calico Hills Formation, and the Prow Pass Tuff (Buesch, Nelson et al. 1996; Buesch, Spengler et al. 1996; Moyer and Geslin 1995).  Based on hydrogeologic properties, the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain has been defined as consisting of six principal hydrogeologic units: unconsolidated alluvium, TCw, Paintbrush nonwelded, Topopah Spring welded, Calico Hills nonwelded, and Crater Flat (Montazer and Wilson 1984). </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The dip of the Cenozoic strata and the transitional nature in hydraulic and fracture properties of stratigraphic units are evidenced by the fact that many of the strata included in the unsaturated zone also comprise the saturated-zone system.  Nomenclature for the rocks comprising the saturated-zone groundwater flow system is based largely on geologic work by Scott and Bonk (1984).  Thermal-mechanical and some hydraulic properties have been described by Ortiz et al. (1985).  The saturated-zone hydrologic units at Yucca Mountain described by Luckey, Tucci et al. (1996) include the lower, densely welded member of the Topopah Spring Tuff and the underlying Calico Hills Formation and Crater Flat Group.  The Tertiary volcanic sequence is subdivided into two aquifers and two confining units, and an underlying Paleozoic sequence comprises an upper confining unit and a lower carbonate aquifer.  These saturated-zone designations vary somewhat, but are correlative to the hydrologic units first described by Winograd and Thordarson (1975) who characterized the hydrology and hydrochemistry of the groundwater flow system in the Nevada Test Site region, which encompasses Yucca Mountain.  More recently, Faunt et al. (1997) have determined the definition of the Tertiary saturated zone system described by Laczniak et al. (1996) may more accurately describe the site saturated zone.  Laczniak et al. (1996) have characterized the Tertiary saturated-zone system at the Nevada Test Site and vicinity, including Yucca Mountain, to include three volcanic aquifers.  As in the work cited above, the lowermost Topopah Springs Tuff comprises the upper volcanic aquifer.  The Crater Flat Group is considered a middle volcanic aquifer.  As in preceding work, the underlying flow breccia and Lithic Ridge Tuff act as a confining unit.  However, the sequence of variably welded ashflow tuffs and rhyolite lavas underlying this confining strata comprise a Tertiary-age lower volcanic aquifer. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Recent work (Buesch, Nelson et al. 1996; Moyer and Geslin 1995) provides new, detailed analyses of the Tertiary-age Paintbrush Group, Calico Hills Formation, and the Prow Pass Formation of the Crater Flat Group strata that may enhance interpretation of geologic controls on the site hydrologic system.  Notwithstanding, hydrogeologic unit properties will be discussed in the context of the principal stratigraphic formations except where reference to the lithostratigraphic unit terminology developed by Buesch, Nelson et al. (1996) and Moyer and Geslin (1995) is necessary to identify unique or anomalous field and core data and enhance interpretation of flux through the site hydrologic system.  Correlation between the geologic, hydrologic, thermal-mechanical, and lithostratigraphic unit designations is shown in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/1a58dc21724bc629882566ad00738c64?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-18</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3.3.1  Unsaturated Zone </font></b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For regional investigations in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain, definition of hydrogeologic units at a level roughly equivalent to geologic formations (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/1a58dc21724bc629882566ad00738c64?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-18</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">) generally is adequate.  However, at the site scale it is necessary to define hydrogeologic units in much greater detail to account for important variations in properties.  (Site-scale investigations of the unsaturated zone are those that focus on the rock units at and above the water table within the boundaries of the site-scale unsaturated-zone flow model (see </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/17dbda7b66c57b57882566da006d2dd3?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Subsection 5.3.4</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.4).  The vertical stratification and specific sequencing of units, as well as transitions between units, have large effects on the spatial variation of percolation flux and distribution of water through the units.  Therefore, the manner in which rocks are designated as hydrogeologic units can greatly influence numerical-model representations of hydrologic conditions in the unsaturated zone.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the early years of the YMP, hydrogeologic unit designations for the unsaturated zone encompassed large rock-unit divisions based primarily on the degree of welding (Scott et al. 1983; Montazer and Wilson 1984).  In addition to welding, this system of identification also recognized other characteristics potentially important to hydrologic properties, such as occurrence of lithophysal cavities, fracturing, bedding, and mineral alteration.  For example, the Tiva Canyon and Topopah Spring Tuffs range from nonwelded at the very top and bottom of each unit to densely welded in the interior with alternating lithophysal and nonlithophysal zones.  Although the densely welded tuffs are highly fractured, the matrix generally has low porosity and permeability.  Nonwelded tuffs have higher porosity and permeability but are sparsely fractured.  Bedded ashfall tuffs are interlayered between the major pyroclastic flow tuffs and have the highest porosity and permeability of any of the rock units.  Although the Calico Hills Formation is nonwelded and generally has high porosity, it has low permeability due to zeolitic alteration over most of the site area.  The Prow Pass Tuff of the Crater Flat Group ranges from welded to nonwelded and exhibits various degrees of mineral alteration.  The Bullfrog Tuff is welded everywhere it has been sampled in boreholes.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3.3.1.1  Characterization of Hydrogeologic Units Using Core-Scale Matrix Properties </font></b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">To define detailed hydrogeologic units (and associated physical and hydrologic properties) adequate for 3-D flow modeling of the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain, an intensive study of matrix properties was performed (Flint, L.E. 1998) using core samples from eight deep and 23 shallow boreholes (see </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/cf0a231f0365cc01882566ad0069cbeb?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Tables 5.3-5</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> and </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/9cc540e18e379b69882566ad0069cfae?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3-6</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/c8840126b2428cf5882566da006ce59d?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Subsection 5.3.2</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.1.2).  The resulting detailed hydrogeologic units are listed in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/417b8d1beba5e6c9882566ad0069f8de?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-13</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> along with formal and informal lithostratigraphic nomenclature and the major hydrogeologic units.  A major goal in this study was defining detailed hydrogeologic unit boundaries so that they corresponded to lithostratigraphic boundaries.  This would facilitate the spatial distribution of properties within the layering scheme for any numerical modeling effort that used the 3-D lithostratigraphic framework model developed by Buesch, Spengler et al. (1996).  To provide reasonable detail and predictive ability within the magnitude and heterogeneity of the Yucca Mountain Site, and to allow for detailed process modeling as well as large-scale 3-D modeling, the number of distinct vertical layers was limited to 30.  The relations between modeling parameters and porosity also were described to provide the means by which even more detailed process models could be constructed, for example, through scaling of parameters in transitional zones where properties change dramatically over short distances, or in clay-altered or vapor-phase corroded zones.  (Note: In this report, the term &#8220;porosity&#8221; refers to that determined from the 105°C oven-dry weights unless otherwise noted.)  The approach of Rautman (1995) for correlating porosity with lithologic features and other hydrologic properties was used for a site-scale model that spatially distributed porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and thermal conductivity throughout the modeling domain.  This approach is discussed in detail later in this subsection.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The distributions of physical properties and hydrologic parameters at the Yucca Mountain Site are complex because of the depositional, cooling, and alteration history of the rocks.  This history results in differences in porosity, connectivity and tortuosity of flowpaths, water-retention character, vertical heterogeneities, and scales of features that all influence the resulting hydrology of the unsaturated zone at the site.  These characteristics are discussed in detail in various subsections of this report.  For example, there are various rock types that result from combining the type of deposition, amount of welding, presence of glass, and composition of grains, which may have crystallized at high temperature (quartz, feldspar, and vapor-phase minerals), or diagenetically altered (zeolites and clays).  Data are presented and described within the context of these rock (lithologic) types.  In several locations, horizontal boundaries between lithostratigraphic and hydrogeologic units are very abrupt.  These contacts need to be represented distinctly in numerical flow models as capillary or permeability barriers so that the hydrologic response to these conditions (such as lateral flow) are simulated accurately (Montazer and Wilson 1984).  In other locations, the transitional zones apparent in the gradual change in matrix properties also need to be modeled appropriately so that numerical flow models do not simulate lateral flow or ponding of water where they do not actually exist (Moyer et al. 1996).  At several locations, glass has been altered to clays and zeolites where lithologic transitions caused high saturations, ancient water tables or perched water caused complete saturation, weathering followed deposition, or thick-welded tuffs cooled slowly (Levy 1984; Broxton et al. 1987; Bish and Aronson 1993; Buesch, Spengler et al. 1995; Levy et al. 1996).  In the upper, crystal-rich zones of both of the major pyroclastic flow units (Tiva Canyon Tuff and Topopah Spring Tuff), varying degrees of vapor-phase corrosion have occurred and resulted in changes in properties with depth, particularly porosity.  (Vapor-phase corrosion or alteration is the dissolution of pumice fragments by hot vapors before moderately welded tuffs cool.)  Vapor-phase corrosion also occurs in the rocks of the Crater Flat Group, and to a lesser degree in the Yucca Mountain and Pah Canyon Tuffs (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/417b8d1beba5e6c9882566ad0069f8de?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-13</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  The relations between lithostratigraphic features (porosity, alteration, micro-fracturing, connectivity, capillary barriers, and welding transitions) and hydrologic conditions and how these characteristics influence the flow of water through the rocks are discussed in detail in L.E. Flint (1998).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Numerical hydrologic flow modeling of the rocks at Yucca Mountain must account for both centimeter-scale features evidenced in matrix-properties characterization and larger-scale properties such as bulk permeability, which is greatly effected by fracturing.  Fractures range in length from a few centimeters to several meters and in aperture from less than a micrometer to hundreds of micrometers.  In addition, fractures may or may not extend across lithostratigraphic unit boundaries, depending on how and when they formed.  Although characterization of matrix properties involves the measurement and description of both small-scale heterogeneities of the rocks and larger scale features of the hydrogeologic units as a whole, the definition of detailed hydrogeologic units is based, nevertheless, on measurement of rock properties from 7 cm diameter core samples collected during the drilling of boreholes.  Thus, matrix-properties analysis is limited to features and properties that can be captured on a relatively small scale.  Many matrix properties of the rock units are adequately represented by analyses at this scale (McKenna and Rautman 1996), but even core samples of this size contain very small-scale heterogeneities that may not be accounted for in the sampling or measurement phases.  Mineral alteration, micro fractures, and even porosity occur variably within the rocks at the core scale.  Although some matrix properties are indicative of larger scale features (e.g., the relatively high matrix porosity of lithophysal zones), many larger scale features (bulk properties of lithophysal cavities, fractures, and faults) will not be adequately represented.  However, these inadequacies are critical in numerical flow modeling only when hydrologic conditions are present that result in flow of water in fractures or faults.</font>

Because water is stored in and flows through the interconnected pores of the rock matrix, porosity is useful for characterizing the hydrologic character of the various rock types.  In general, the porosity can be related primarily to the depositional features and amount of welding of a rock, with the lowest porosities occurring in the most densely welded rocks and the highest porosities occurring in the nonwelded and bedded rocks.  Examples of borehole profiles illustrating porosity, saturation, and particle density of all lithostratigraphic units are shown in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/9c63f6f25a3ea79d882566ad00738d71?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figures 5.3-19</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> and </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/a757d66263018ed9882566ad00724474?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3-20</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.

At the land surface, the borehole penetrates the Paintbrush nonwelded hydrogeologic unit, which is relatively thick at this location.  The borehole bottoms out within unit 1 of the Prow Pass Tuff.  Because infiltration is high (Flint, A.L. et al. 1996) at this location, the TCw hydrogeologic unit is absent, and the Calico Hills Formation is composed only of zeolitic rocks, saturations are very high throughout the profile below the Paintbrush nonwelded hydrogeologic unit, especially in the Topopah Spring Tuff middle nonlithophysal zone, which is the potential repository horizon.  In contrast, borehole SD-7 (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/a757d66263018ed9882566ad00724474?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-20</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">) is located on Highway Ridge to the south of the repository footprint.  At this location, the Tiva Canyon Tuff is about 80 m thick, the Paintbrush nonwelded hydrogeologic unit is very thin, infiltration is lower, and the upper several meters of the Calico Hills Formation are not zeolitic.  This combination of conditions in the rocks at borehole SD-7 results in abrupt decreases in saturation below the repository horizon.  The unaltered rocks below the basal vitrophyre of the Topopah Spring Tuff are very low in saturation, as are the rocks in the upper part of the Prow Pass Tuff unit 3.  This results in large decreases in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and, therefore, reductions in transport pathways and flux through the matrix or fractures from the repository horizon to the water table.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The relations between porosity and saturation were used to subdivide the major hydrogeologic units into the detailed hydrogeologic units as described below. </font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Tiva Canyon Welded Hydrogeologic Unit</font></b><b><font size="4" face="WP TypographicSymbols">n</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The TCw hydrogeologic unit was described by Montazer and Wilson (1984) as the densely to moderately welded uppermost stratigraphic layer that underlies much of Yucca Mountain.  It dips 5 to 10° eastward, is absent in some washes and is about 150 m thick beneath Yucca Crest.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The transition from densely welded to vapor-phase corroded rocks in the uppermost part of the Tiva Canyon Tuff is sparsely sampled and is observable in its entirety only in surface-outcrop transects (Flint, L.E. et al. 1996b).  Therefore, properties of the uppermost units are based on the analogous rocks in the uppermost welded units of the Topopah Spring Tuff.  The upper part of Tpcrn4 (hydrogeologic unit CCR) is densely welded, whereas the lower part of Tpcrn4 and the underlying Tpcrn3 are increasingly vapor-phase corroded with depth.  Although the Tpcrn4 is not present at this location, borehole N27 is located fairly high within the section, beginning in the base of Tpcrn3 where the CUC is highest in porosity.  Tpcrn2 and Tpcrn1 have lower porosity and less vapor-phase corrosion than the overlying units, but higher porosity and more vapor-phase corrosion than the Tpcpul.  Therefore, boundaries of the hydrogeologic units were selected primarily on the basis of porosity.  The boundary between CCR and CUC (Flint, L.E. 1998) is located at the depth at which the porosity increases to greater than 9 percent, and the boundary between CUC and CUL (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/bdc166490c90b1ea882566ad0073bf85?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-21</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">) is located at the depth at which the porosity decreases to less than 20 percent.  Because the CUL has somewhat higher porosity than the underlying densely welded rocks of the Tiva Canyon Tuff, the lower boundary of CUL was defined as the lithostratigraphic contact between the Tpcpul and the Tpcpmn.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The middle and lower parts of the crystallized rocks of the Tiva Canyon Tuff include the Tpcpmn, Tpcpll, Tpcplnh, and Tpcplnc (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/417b8d1beba5e6c9882566ad0069f8de?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-13</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  As indicated by the profiles for boreholes SD-7 and N55 (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/bdc166490c90b1ea882566ad0073bf85?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-21</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">), because porosity is very uniform through these lithostratigraphic units, together they comprise the CW. Toward the base of the lower nonlithophysal columnar subzone (Tpcplnc), porosity increases because of an increased amount of vapor-phase corrosion and the transition from welded to nonwelded in the vitric rocks below (Buesch, Spengler et al. 1996).  The base of the CW is where the porosity increases in the vapor-phase corroded rocks to greater than 14 percent. </font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Paintbrush Nonwelded Hydrogeologic Unit</font></b><b><font size="4" face="WP TypographicSymbols">n</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The PTn hydrogeologic unit of Montazer and Wilson (1984) is described as consisting of the nonwelded and partially welded base of the Tiva Canyon Tuff, the Yucca Mountain and Pah Canyon Tuffs, the upper nonwelded and partially welded upper part of the Topopah Spring Tuff and the associated bedded tuffs.  It consists of thin, nonwelded ashflow sheets and bedded tuffs that attain a maximum thickness of 100 m and thin to the southeast to about 20 m.  This unit outcrops in several locations, particularly along Solitario Canyon and Yucca Wash. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">To define the detailed character of these rocks, they are separated into several hydrogeologic units.  The rocks near the base of the Tiva Canyon Tuff exhibit transitions in porosity and mineral alteration and are divided into the CMW and CNW hydrogeologic units.  The CMW hydrogeologic unit consists of moderately welded rocks near the base of the Tpcplnc and usually most of Tpcpv2 (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/417b8d1beba5e6c9882566ad0069f8de?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-13</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).

The CNW consists of nonwelded to partially welded rocks in Tpcpv1, and locally includes the base of Tpcpv2.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Although the lithostratigraphic units of the Paintbrush nonwelded hydrogeologic unit generally are relatively thin, their properties are distinct enough to warrant delineation as separate hydrogeologic units.  A numerical modeling exercise was performed by L.E. Flint et al. (1996b) to assess the hydrologic significance of these units and to determine whether or not their properties were sufficiently different to warrant delineation as separate units.  The modeling results indicated that abrupt and linear contacts along with the contrasts in properties were instrumental in creating lateral flow of water along the sloping contacts.  However, in reality this exercise simplified the linear character of the contacts because the contacts are only locally linear and are less likely to divert water laterally due to heterogeneities, which cause increases in saturation and local instabilities that result in vertical flow across the contact.  The Yucca Mountain Tuff has properties very similar to the Tpbt4 and Tpbt3 to the south of Drillhole Wash but has lower porosity and becomes moderately welded to the north.  In the modeling exercise (Flint, A.L. et al. 1996; Moyer et al. 1996), this unit was represented by the properties of the lower porosity rocks, and it caused water to be diverted laterally.  As a result, TPY represents rocks of less than or equal to 30 percent porosity, and the bedded tuff units Tpbt4 and Tpbt3 represent the Yucca Mountain Tuff where there is greater than 30 percent porosity (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/417b8d1beba5e6c9882566ad0069f8de?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-13</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  To the south of Drillhole Wash, the hydrogeologic unit BT3 represents both Yucca Mountain Tuff and Tpbt3.  The Pah Canyon Tuff is welded far to the north in Yucca Wash, but no welded or even moderately welded rocks were found in the samples of the Pah Canyon from boreholes at the site.  Therefore, the nonwelded to partially welded Pah Canyon Tuff is hydrogeologic unit TPP.  Because the modeling results indicated that the properties of the Tpbt2 and the nonwelded top of the Topopah Spring Tuff (Tptrv3) were not sufficiently different to warrant delineation of two separate units (Flint, A.L. et al. 1996; Moyer et al. 1996), the Tpbt2 and the Tptrv3 are represented by hydrogeologic unit BT2 (</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-13</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  Because the Tptrv2 is a thin unit that marks the sharp transition from nonwelded to densely welded rocks, it is included as the lower part of BT2. </font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mineral Alteration</font></b><b><font size="4" face="WP TypographicSymbols">n</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mineral alteration has a significant influence on the hydrologic properties of rock units.  Porosity, for example, is directly related to the alteration history of the rocks at Yucca Mountain because clays, zeolites, opal, and calcite form in situ or are deposited in pore spaces, causing a reduction in porosity.  However, the occurrence of clay or zeolite zones reduces the measured porosity only slightly because water is stored in clay and zeolite mineral structures rather than in pore spaces.  An exception involves smectites, which swell with the incorporation of water to as much as 300 times their original size, thus reducing the porosity.  Because clays and zeolites influence pore-size distribution, their presence also affects moisture-retention characteristics and permeability.  Rocks containing clay or zeolites typically contain a relatively large volume of water, but because the water is held tightly within clay structures and very small pores, the permeability is reduced.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A laboratory measurement that is used for identifying rocks containing altered minerals is &#8220;residual water content.&#8221;  Residual water content has been defined, historically, as the water content in a sample for which the change in water content divided by the change in water potential is zero (van Genuchten 1980).  It may also be thought of as the degree of saturation at which liquid flow stops, due to discontinuous columns of water, and vapor flow begins (Flint, L.E. 1998).  Studies of soils indicate that residual water content can be determined as the amount of water left in the pores after equilibrating a rock sample in an environment of approximately  700 bars water potential, or about 65 percent relative humidity (Jackson 1964; Rose, D.A. 1963).  Residual water content generally is used as the dry-end fit parameter for moisture-retention curves and its magnitude greatly affects the prediction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at low water contents.  &#8220;Residual water&#8221; is the water remaining in rock at very low saturation after complete drainage, residing in the smallest pores and channels, within the structure of minerals such as clays or zeolites, and adsorbed on the surfaces of these minerals.  Residual water, whether contained in mineral structures or in very small pores, remains relatively immobile in the liquid phase and is removed from the rock primarily in the vapor phase. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">However, the definition of &#8220;residual water content&#8221; is critically dependent on the method or methods used to dry rock samples.  Bush and Jenkins (1970) determined that drying rock samples in an oven at a temperature of 60°C and 40 percent relative humidity maintained water within the clay structures, as well as one to two molecular layers of water adsorbed to their surface, while removing it from the pore channels.  Accordingly, after saturation (see </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/c8840126b2428cf5882566da006ce59d?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Subsection 5.3.2</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.1.2.2), rock samples from Yucca Mountain were dried at 60°C and 65 percent relative humidity and at 105°C and ambient relative humidity (&lt; 20 percent), and porosity was calculated using both dry weights.  The difference between the porosities calculated from the two different drying methods is equivalent to the volumetric water content of the sample after it has been dried at 65 percent relative humidity and is defined herein as the &#8220;residual water content.&#8221;  A residual water content of 5 percent or greater was determined to be an appropriate threshold indicative of the presence of altered minerals (Rautman and McKenna 1997; Flint, L.E. 1998).  For example, a residual water content of 5 percent or greater was determined for nearly saturated rock samples from the Tpcpv unit near the base of the Tiva Canyon Tuff (borehole N31; </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/2821e74cc5933c36882566ad0073bf86?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-22</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  This zone of significant residual water content also correlates with the presence of up to 35 percent smectite, which is pervasive in varying quantities across the site (Bish and Chipera 1989).  The extent of mineral alteration seems to be related to the topographic location of borehole N31 in that it is located in a narrow up-wash channel with thin alluvium.  In such a setting, the subsurface rocks have been subjected to more frequent infiltration events that have sustained relatively high water contents in the rocks for longer periods of time (Flint, L.E. and Flint 1995).  The adjacent borehole (N32; </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-22</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">), located only 15 m away but not in the channel, has a thinner altered zone in the base of the Tiva Canyon Tuff.  This zone of mineral alteration at the base of the Tiva Canyon Tuff, which occurs within the CMW unit, is an important hydrologic feature in that it may accentuate the capillary barrier caused by small pores overlying large pores at this transition from welded to nonwelded tuffs.  Although the altered zone continues downward through the base of the BT3 unit, high saturations are not maintained despite the presence of clay.  This is because the combination of very large porosities and the particular pore-size distributions of the units below the CMW result in drainage.</font>

Tptrn3 is typically thicker to the north and very thin in the southern parts of the site area.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Most of the crystallized, moderately to densely welded Topopah Spring Tuff is divided into five hydrogeologic units that closely correspond to lithostratigraphic units.  The vapor-phase corroded and crystal-transition subzones of the crystal-rich nonlithophysal zone (Tptrn2) have porosities similar to the underlying lithophysal zone (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/fa047b113f1a9dbc882566ad0073bf87?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-23</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">), but moisture-retention characteristics (discussed below) differ significantly.  Therefore, Tptrn2 is represented by the single hydrogeologic unit TR and has porosities greater than 9 percent.  Porosities of the lithophysal zones (Tptrl, Tptpul and Tptpll) and nonlithophysal zones (Tptpmn, Tptpln) differ significantly, with the lithophysal zones having porosities of about 14 percent and the nonlithophysal zones having porosities of about 11 percent (</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-23</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  In addition, because they differ significantly in moisture-retention characteristics, each zone is represented by individual hydrogeologic units: TUL (upper lithophysal zone), TMN (middle nonlithophysal zone), TLL (lower lithophysal zone), and TM2 and TM1 (lower nonlithophysal zone).  The lower nonlithophysal zone of the Topopah Spring Tuff is divided into two hydrogeologic units because porosities decrease with greater depth to about 9 percent and as locally the rocks become more vitric.  The result is that the rocks at the base that have different moisture-retention characteristics due to an increase in the amount of smectite with greater depth (Bish and Chipera 1989).  Porosities of the vitric rocks at the base of the Topopah Spring Tuff contrast greatly with the rocks above them (</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-23</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).

The Calico Hills Formation consists of a nonwelded pyroclastic flow, thin fallout deposits, and, locally, a basal bedded sandstone.

The part of the formation that is primarily pyroclastic flow deposits, which includes units 1 through 4, is divided into hydrogeologic units CHV and CHZ, depending on whether it is vitric or zeolitic, respectively.  In this analysis, the vitric-zeolitic boundary was determined based on measurements of residual water content rather than on lithologic descriptions that include estimates of mineral percentages.  The presence of zeolites was defined as a threshold of 5 percent or greater residual water content in altered rocks that were suspected of being zeolitic (Rautman and McKenna 1997).

Chipera et al. (1995) reported significant percentages of clinoptilolite in these units in borehole UZ-16 (</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-26</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, right-most column), confirming that these units are zeolitic.  However, other intervals in borehole SD-7 (e.g., PP3 and parts of PP2) have significant residual water content even though no zeolites were found (</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-24</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  This is because these intervals contain significant quantities of the vapor-phase alteration minerals tridymite and cristobalite (Rautman and Engstrom 1996a, Appendix H).  (Cristobalite is present from depths 502.3 to 569.4 m (2 to 35 percent) and tridymite is present from 502.3 to 538.4 m (1 to 6 percent).)  These results indicate that although 5-percent-or-greater residual water content always is present in rocks where zeolites are found, the converse is not true because the presence of other alteration minerals like tridymite and cristobalite can produce the same effect.  However, it is apparent that the presence of cristobalite alone does not produce this effect but, rather, that tridymite is necessary, possibly in combination with cristobalite.  This conclusion is based on the fact that although cristobalite alone was present in the interval from 538.4 to 569.4 m in unit PP2, significant residual water content was not found throughout the interval.  Overall, these findings indicate that certain vapor-phase alteration minerals have significant effects on the structure and geometry of the pore spaces in the rock, resulting in greater moisture-retention capacity at low saturations.  The greater tortuosity of the flow channels caused by the presence of clay, zeolites, or vapor-phase minerals also reduces the permeability, as discussed below.  (There is evidence that the very high percentages of opal-CT (a disordered silica phase containing both cristobalite- and tridymite-like structural units) often found in the Tacbt (Bish and Chipera 1989) may influence the hydrologic character of rocks by reducing the permeability even more than the presence of zeolites.)</font>

In the crystallized and minimally vapor-phase-corroded Prow Pass Tuff (PP4, PP2, and PP1), saturations are high because the rocks are welded and have small pores.

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">To facilitate the use of matrix hydrologic properties data in numerical flow models, mean values and standard deviations were calculated for all measured properties and for estimated K</font><sub><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">s</font></sub><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> values from the regression analysis for each hydrogeologic unit (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/cff4db1c90f99913882566ad0069faea?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-14</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  In general, the variation in porosity within each hydrogeologic unit was relatively small, with the exception of BT4, BT2, and PV2 (Flint, L.E. 1998).  Because BT4 is very thin and few samples were collected, substantial variation in properties was expected.  The relatively large variation in properties in BT2 resulted from the fact that it is composed of lithostratigraphic units that vary significantly in the amount of mineral alteration, and it includes the moderately welded Tptrv2 that rapidly grades downward into low porosity rocks.  The same is true for the PV2, which grades relatively sharply from very low-porosity to relatively high-porosity rocks.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Several important results are apparent from comparison of mean values of porosity for the hydrogeologic units (Flint, L.E. 1998).  In the Tiva Canyon Tuff, the lithophysal CUL has a mean porosity (16 percent) that is twice that of the mostly nonlithophysal CW (8 percent).  In contrast, within the TSw unit, mean porosities of lithophysal and nonlithophysal units do not differ quite as much as in the Tiva Canyon Tuff in that the TUL and TLL have mean porosities of 15 and 13 percent, respectively, and the TMN, TM2, and TM1 have mean porosities of 11, 11, and 9 percent, respectively.  The vitric bedded tuffs and nonwelded ashflow tuffs of the Paintbrush nonwelded hydrogeologic unit, included in CNW, BT4, BT3, and BT2, vary in mean porosity from 39 to 49 percent.  These porosities are significantly higher than similarly deposited vitric tuffaceous rocks in BT1 and CHV that have mean porosities of 27 and 34 percent, respectively.  All units below the Topopah Spring Tuff have moderate to high mean porosity (26 to 34 percent) except for BF3, which has 11 percent.  Frequency distributions of porosity developed for each detailed hydrogeologic unit (Flint, L.E. 1998; Appendix I) indicate normal distributions for most units.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mean water content, saturation, and water potential also were calculated (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/cff4db1c90f99913882566ad0069faea?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-14</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">), but the meaningfulness of these values must be considered in the context of the entire unsaturated-zone system (Flint, L.E. 1998).  Actually, spatial averaging of water content, saturation, and water potential values is not realistic because these characteristics are dependent on the spatial distribution of net infiltration.  Spatially variable net infiltration results from spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation, varying thickness of alluvial cover, topographic positions of boreholes, and variable thickness of shallow rock units with different properties (Flint, A.L. and Flint 1994; Flint, L.E. and Flint 1995; Hudson and Flint 1996).</font>

For the first three hydrogeologic units (CW, BT3, and TR), the data sets include both laboratory desorption curves and composite curves combining laboratory data and all field data that were collected from cores.  Standard errors of the curve-fit parameters (a and n) were used to include the 66 percent confidence intervals about the curve-fit models.  These intervals were used for graphical purposes because the lower limits of the 95 percent intervals were undefined for a number of hydrogeologic units.  Two models were developed: one model is associated with the laboratory desorption data (thick line on </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/d98afbb25c2dce41882566ad0073bf8c?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-28a-c</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">) and the second model is associated with the composite data set.  In all three units, the composite model plotted lower on the graph because of inclusion of field samples that had lower water contents for given water potentials than the laboratory desorption data.  This results in slightly wetter, air entry values (lower a), which increases modeled fluxes for the same matrix saturation.  For the other three hydrogeologic units (TUL, PV3 and CHZ), the data sets consist of laboratory desorption measurements only and include the error incorporated into the laboratory measurement due to the instrument resolution. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Notable differences in the moisture-retention curves are chiefly a function of the pore size distributions of the rock types.  These different distributions are primarily due to degree of welding, and are exemplified by comparing the curve for the bedded tuff (BT3) to those of the welded tuffs CW and TUL.  The welded tuff units all have high air entry pressures, approximately equivalent to 1/a, and describe the water potential at which the pores initially drain, and thus represent the largest pores.  Rocks in the hydrogeologic unit TR are vapor-phase corroded, which increases the size of the pores and results in pore structures that drain at lower water potential than non-corroded welded rocks.  Another contrasting characteristic is the residual saturation, which is approximately represented by the saturation at which the dry end of the curves becomes asymptotic.  Residual saturation is caused by the abundance of very small pores that retain water at approximately 65 percent relative humidity ( 700 bars).  Altered rocks such as CHZ, or vitrophyres such as PV3, have the largest residual saturations, although for altered rocks some of this is due to residual water (see Subsections 5.3.3.1.1.1 and 5.3.3.1.1.2 for discussions of mineral alteration.)</font>

Regression models were made for the prediction of a log that was determined for all hydrogeologic units for the purposes of estimating parameters from porosity.  These models are useful for the representation of more gradual transition zones in numerical flow models (Glass et al. 1994) to eliminate unwarranted lateral flow of water that results from flow-model layers that unrealistically simulate sharply contrasting properties (Flint, L.E. et al. 1996a; Moyer et al. 1996).

Method 2 fits the conductivity data measured on the centrifuge, then predicts the moisture retention.  Method 3 simultaneously fits both the moisture-retention and conductivity data.  Method 1 results in a poor prediction of the conductivity data.  The driest point, collected from volumetric water content at relative humidity dryness, is not predicted from either methods 2 or 3, suggesting that it is an inappropriate definition of residual water content when considered for unsaturated flow processes.  It is possible that there are two residual water contents, one representing physical and static properties and another representing flow processes.  If the moisture retention-data are fit without including the &#8220;residual water content&#8221; point, the unsaturated-hydraulic-conductivity data can adequately be predicted by moisture-retention data for these two samples.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3.3.1.1.5  Lithologic Stratification: Transitions and Capillary and Permeability Barriers </font></b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Lithologic features, such as degree of welding, layering in ashfall tuffs, fracture distributions, and subsequent mineralogic alteration, are critical to characterize in order to determine the distribution of hydrologic conditions within the vertically stratified system at Yucca Mountain.  The primary large-scale feature controlling the moisture distribution and flux at Yucca Mountain is the occurrence of nonwelded and bedded tuffs of the PTn hydrogeologic unit between two welded and fractured pyroclastic flow units, the Tiva Canyon and Topopah Spring Tuffs (Flint, L.E. 1998).  This stratigraphic orientation results in transition zones that exhibit pronounced vertical variations in matrix properties, typically caused by variations in porosity due to welding, mineral alteration, or vapor-phase corrosion, or by abrupt contrasts in properties due to layering of ashfall tuffs.  Corresponding to the degree of welding, fracture characteristics (density, geometry, and continuity) typically are poorly developed in nonwelded tuffs and well developed in the welded rocks.  The transition zone from fracture-dominated flow in welded rocks (where saturation is high) to matrix-dominated flow in nonwelded rocks, can significantly affect the overall nature of large-scale flow in the unsaturated zone.  Sharp decrease or increase in the magnitude of hydrologic properties with depth (that also corresponds to changes in the degree of fracturing) in these transition zones may result in localized concentration of water due to capillary or permeability barriers or effects, or depletion of water due to drainage (Flint, L.E. 1998).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The concept of a natural capillary barrier is summarized by Montazer and Wilson (1984) as a fine-grained layer overlying a coarse-grained layer, where water cannot flow from the smaller pores into the larger pores until the height of water in the overlying layer exceeds a critical height, equivalent to the difference in the capillary rise of the two pore sizes.  At Yucca Mountain the potential for this condition occurs when a porous medium, such as the nonwelded rocks of the Paintbrush nonwelded hydrogeologic unit, is bounded above and below by double-porosity media such as the welded and fractured rocks of the Tiva Canyon and Topopah Spring Tuffs (Montazer and Wilson 1984).  A capillary barrier could theoretically be present at the top of the nonwelded rocks where fine-grained welded rocks overlie coarse-grained nonwelded rocks.  A barrier could also be present at the base of the nonwelded rocks where the coarse-grained rocks overlie the larger-aperture fractures present in the welded rocks.  If these conditions exist in the layered, dipping beds at Yucca Mountain, they could potentially result in lateral flow of water (Flint, L.E. 1998).  The theoretical bases for and behavior of capillary and permeability barriers are discussed further in L.E. Flint (1998).</font>

These zones indicate either contrasts in properties that have resulted in long-term preferential flow pathways, high-saturation zones that allowed development of clays, or high-temperature depositional features that influence the flow pathways (Levy et al. 1996).</font>

With a simulated vertical percolation flux at the upper boundary flux of only 1 mm/year, significant lateral flow occurs, particularly at the TPP-BT2 boundary because of a large contrast in permeability.  Later flow also occurs in the simulation at CMW-CNW transitional zone at the base of the Tiva Canyon Tuff and at the TPY- BT3 contact.  Saturations within the PTn hydrogeologic unit correlate relatively well with saturated hydraulic conductivity but are not high enough to initiate fracture flow at the sharp contact of the PTn hydrogeologic unit and the TSw unit (Flint, L.E. 1998).  An ongoing study is attempting to quantify the contrasts in properties of the hydrogeologic units within the PTn hydrogeologic unit that would be necessary to cause significant lateral flow of water under existing and future climatic conditions. </font>

The Ghost Dance fault zone has been penetrated by core holes at several locations including borehole N35, which penetrates the fault in the Tiva Canyon Tuff, and in horizontal boreholes in the Northern and Southern Ghost Dance fault alcoves of the Exploratory Studies Facility, which penetrate the fault at the potential repository horizon.  Borehole N35 is located in Broken Limb Wash near SD-12 and penetrates the fault zone at a depth of approximately 30 m.  The porosity of the brecciated zone (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/5783cd74593de1c0882566ad00745826?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-32</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">) is not significantly different than the surrounding rock units and the saturation of the breccia is only slightly higher.  Rocks in the foot wall of the fault (below the breccia zone) have properties appropriate for the unit but exhibited saturations 15 to 20 percent higher than expected at the time of drilling.  Systematic neutron-moisture logging was done in N35 from the time of drilling in early 1993 until the fall of 1995 to monitor changes in volumetric water content with depth and time (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/f47d03e631f12f42882566ad00745827?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-33</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  Significant precipitation occurred during the winter of 1993, resulting in an increase in water content at the surface.  Coincidentally, one to two months later, rocks in the foot wall of the fault showed increase in water content from 2.5 to 7.5 percent and, over the next few months, to over 10 percent.  While the water did not travel directly through the soil profile, as apparent in the figure, the fault is exposed at the surface several meters upslope from the borehole, providing a fast pathway for precipitation to penetrate the surface (Flint, L.E. 1998). </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Analysis of rock core from the horizontal borehole in the Exploratory Studies Facility Northern Ghost Dance fault alcove indicates that the porosity of the TMN changes abruptly at the main trace of the fault in that the porosity of the rock on the foot wall is about 2 percent lower than the porosity of the rock in the hanging wall (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/a707671c41c46a90882566ad00745828?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-34</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  The change in porosity likely was not caused by the faulting itself but is simply a reflection of the spatial variability of porosity within the TMN that is accentuated by the offset and by the brecciated fault zone.  Although the saturation profile of the borehole indicates preferential drying of the most highly fractured zones by drilling air, a core sample collected at the deepest penetration of the hanging wall (about 49 m) was completely saturated and all of the other samples had a saturation of about 90 percent. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Based on saturation data from these two boreholes, the first penetrating the Ghost Dance fault above the PTn hydrogeologic unit and the second penetrating the fault in the TSw hydrogeologic unit, it is likely that the fault zone is a fast pathway for water percolating through the Tiva Canyon Tuff, causing increases in saturation in the rock matrix of the foot wall.  Although the fault probably also is a fast pathway for water percolating through the PTn hydrogeologic unit, there is little indication based on core samples that the fault serves as a preferential pathway for water through the TSw hydrogeologic unit.  Rather, it is likely that water moves through the surrounding highly fractured rock of the TSw hydrogeologic unit just as readily as it moves through the fault zone.  Core samples from a horizontal borehole in the Southern Ghost Dance fault alcove are being analyzed to determine if similar conditions exist there.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3.3.1.1.7  Spatial Variability of Matrix Properties </font></b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Rock properties vary vertically and laterally as the result of original depositional, cooling processes, and subsequent post-depositional alteration (Rautman and Flint 1992; Rautman 1995; Flint, L.E. et al. 1996b; Istok et al. 1994; Buesch, Nelson et al. 1996).  At certain scales and at certain positions within the volcanic rocks at Yucca Mountain, the influence of deterministic geologic processes is so strong that the changes in material properties can be predicted with a high degree of confidence (Flint, L.E. 1998).  For example, porosities are relatively high in the rocks at the base of the ashflow sheets (Tiva Canyon and TSw hydrogeologic units) where cooling occurred quickly, with progressively lower porosities occurring at higher stratigraphic levels and decreasing to very low porosities in the interior of the deposit where temperatures remained high long enough for compaction and welding to occur.  Such trends in matrix hydrologic properties are readily observable in rock samples collected from surface transects of outcrops and from systematic sampling of the rocks exposed n the Exploratory Studies Facility.</font>

Samples of the Tiva Canyon Tuff outcrop on the west-facing slope of Solitario Canyon were collected along a series of 26 vertical transects in the vicinity of borehole UZ-6 (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/653c197438319d9c882566ad00718b42?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-8</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The nonlinear vertical trends in porosity (and in the correlated property saturated-hydraulic conductivity) are attributed to the compaction and cooling history of the rocks.  Because minimal compaction occurred in the lower subunits, where heat loss to the underlying cooler units caused the glass shards to lose their plasticity quickly, these subunits remained nonwelded and retained higher porosities.  Analysis of the horizontal trends in the properties indicated a lack of substantial spatial correlation.  However, because of the obvious vertical trends, vertical models were fit to the data sets in order to predict properties of the corresponding stratigraphic elevation in other locations.  Prediction errors (measured minus predicted values) for three surface transects and five boreholes (N11, N37, N53, N54, and N55) are shown in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/896b200bbef713cc882566ad0074582b?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-37</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  The model for porosity was able to predict within 95 percent confidence intervals the porosity of samples from surface outcrops at locations within the potential repository block, south to Busted Butte, and north to Pagany Wash.  The model poorly predicted porosities in the upper part of the vertical transect to the north in Yucca Wash, which is closer to the source caldera of the tuffaceous flows.  Using properties of outcrop samples was less successful in predicting properties measured on borehole samples, at least for the Tpcplnc and Tpcpv2, which comprise the welding transition zone.  The error is the greatest for the borehole (N11) located closest to the source caldera, with the next highest error for the other borehole located to the north of the potential repository block.  Apparently, the parts of the large-volume ashflow sheets closest to the source are more affected by complex depositional processes than the more distant parts.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The vertical trends apparent in the hydrologic properties of rocks near the base of the Tiva Canyon Tuff seem to be the result of deterministic processes, at least to the extent that regression equations based on measured physical and hydrologic properties can reasonably predict properties of this zone in other locations at Yucca Mountain.  The results of this study support the use of properties such as porosity, that display deterministic trends, to correlate with parameters that are more difficult to measure or predict for spatially distributing properties for site-scale numerical flow models.  The regression models describing trends in hydrologic properties provide important insights for process modeling that are not readily discernable based solely on the sets of measured values.</font>

However, a large-scale analysis of areal distribution of porosity was done using kriging for the two hydrogeologic units that were penetrated by the largest number of boreholes, the welded Tiva Canyon Tuff (CW) and Pre-Pah Canyon/Topopah Spring bedded tuff (BT2).  In the vicinity of the potential repository, CW has a relatively smooth increase in porosity from south (about 7 percent) to the north (about 12 percent) based on data from 15 boreholes (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/a517c885bf42f668882566ad00759377?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-41a</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  In contrast, BT2 has a smaller areal distribution and a range in porosity from 37 percent at borehole SD-7 to 52 percent at the northern end of the repository block, based on data from 13 boreholes.  The calculated areal variation in porosity for these two units is in contrast to the lack of lateral trends in the 2-D surface transect study of the base of the Tiva Canyon Tuff discussed above.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Vertical variability of matrix properties within hydrogeologic units can be reasonably described for most of the units as indicated in previous sections.  Problematic units are very thin or layered units, or those with features larger than core-size samples that dominate the flow of water at the site scale.  However, there is a large degree of uncertainty associated with the representations of areal variability of hydrologic properties because of the high degree of heterogeneity of the rocks and because the bulk of the data is from core-scale sized samples from 1-D boreholes sparsely distributed over the study area.  The areal distribution of core-scale properties might adequately be represented for large-scale numerical flow models by the correlation of flow properties with surrogates such as porosity, which can be modeled using lithostratigraphic distributions and which has been shown to be related to flow properties (Istok et al. 1994; Rautman et al. 1995; Flint, L.E. et al. 1996b; Flint, L.E. 1998).  The correlation of porosity with lithology provides a much larger database with which to calculate spatial distributions.  This relationship is discussed in detail in the description of the property-modeling exercises contained in the following subsection.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3.3.1.1.8  Three-Dimensional Modeling of Rock-Property Heterogeneity </font></b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A somewhat different, alternative approach to the understanding of variability and spatial heterogeneity of rock material properties involved 3-D property modeling of the Yucca Mountain Site and was described by Rautman (1996) and Rautman and McKenna (1997).  Rather than subdividing the volcanic tuffs at Yucca Mountain into a large number of slightly differing geologic units, the spatial positions and boundaries between which must be inferred from widely spaced drill holes, these authors examined and modeled the complete spatial distribution of material properties corresponding to several major rock-type groupings.  The modeling of spatial variability described by Rautman and McKenna (1997) involved the assessment of the uncertainty associated with predictions of spatially varying material properties at unsampled locations within the subsurface of Yucca Mountain.  In effect, the approach of Rautman and McKenna (1997) involves the generation of a suite of spatially variable material-property models, each of which is consistent with the observed data at the spatial locations of those data, and which vary stochastically away from data locations in a manner that is compatible with the quantitative spatial continuity description of the data.  The concept is borrowed from more conventional uncertainty assessment in engineering through Monte Carlo analysis.  Recognizing that it is impossible to know with certainty the exact hydrologic properties of a sparsely sampled spatially heterogeneous domain, the performance consequences of a set of geologically plausible alternative models, all of which are compatible with knowledge of the site, was evaluated.  Variation among a set of statistically indistinguishable heterogeneous models thus represents the uncertainty that results from less-than-exhaustive observation and description.  Because material properties in geologic materials (including at Yucca Mountain) are generally spatially correlated, simulation of rock properties effectively amounts to drawing entire material-property models from some hypothetical &#8220;distribution&#8221; of alternative &#8220;realities.&#8221; This conceptual framework for hydrogeologic description is represented in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/c77b26136efa9c94882566ad00759378?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-42</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A fundamental premise of the Monte Carlo simulation approach is that each individual realization is a plausible model of the unknown real world and that variation between the different stochastic realizations represents a variety of outcomes consistent with all that is known.  Presumably, the only meaningful difference between realization 1 and realization N is that a different random number &#8220;seed&#8221; was used to initiate the simulation process definition of the random path and the generation of the various uniform random numbers that produce the output value at each node from the locally conditioned probability density function.  Therefore, it is possible to test the validity of individual models in terms of statistical similarity to the data.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Recognizing that the term &#8220;validation&#8221; has a number of frequently controversial meanings within the modeling community, Rautman and McKenna (1997) restricted the meaning of this word to the following empirical tests of agreement between a simulated exhaustive model of reality and the underlying partially known (i.e., sampled) vision of reality obtained from site data.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A.  Does the model reproduce the measured values of the particular attribute that were used to generate the model at the proper spatial position of those values?</font>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The data used by Rautman and McKenna (1997) included both matrix-property measurements of core samples (described previously) and down-hole petrophysical measurements of in situ rocks (Nelson 1996a, 1996b; CRWMS M&amp;O 1996a).  In the latter case, geophysical measurements of density, water content, and water resistivity on a foot-by-foot basis were converted to porosity through accepted petrophysical relationships.  The petrophysical measurements represent a substantially larger volume of rock (roughly a spherical volume 0.5 to 0.6 m in diameter) than that of most core samples (roughly a sphere 0.05 to 0.06 m in diameter).  However, with the exception of measurements of the principal lithophysae-bearing intervals of the Topopah Spring Tuff, the measurements obtained by the two methods are quite similar and match one another quite closely where both are available for the same borehole interval.  Core porosity values (from relative humidity drying) within lithophysae-bearing intervals were observed by Rautman and McKenna (1997) to be approximated quite closely in non-cored boreholes by a related petrophysical measurement, the so-called &#8220;water-filled&#8221; porosity of Nelson (1996a, 1996b).  The difference between the water-filled porosity and the more conventional total petrophysical porosity in these lithophysae-bearing intervals is attributed to the presence of lithophysal cavities varying up to several tens of centimeters across.  These cavities act to increase the (total) porosity of the bulk rock; however, under unsaturated hydrologic conditions, moisture cannot be held by capillary forces within these macro pores, and thus this petrophysical property can be used as a surrogate for core &#8220;matrix&#8221; porosity.  The inclusion of petrophysical data increased the number of boreholes used to characterize material properties to 51, of which 37 provide deep penetrations of the volcanic section.</font>

Note that within this conceptual (probabilistic; Monte Carlo) framework, sampling variability is not equated with measurement &#8220;error&#8221; associated with some &#8220;true&#8221; property value.  The true properties of the &#8220;real&#8221; rocks vary with the spatial position at which one observes those rocks.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Spatial continuity analysis builds on the geologic intuition that pairs of samples located relatively close to one another will resemble one another statistically more than pairs of samples located farther apart.  Quantitative description of spatial continuity patterns (also frequently referred to as spatial correlation) employed standard variography techniques (Journel and Huijbregts 1978; Isaaks and Srivastava 1989), and was conducted separately for each of the three hydrogeologic modeling units.  Experimental (semi) variograms were computed in three stratigraphic dimensions, corrected for post-depositional tilting and faulting (Rautman and McKenna 1997).  The variogram estimator used by Rautman and McKenna (1997) was the semivariogram, g, which is traditionally defined as half the average squared difference between two attribute values approximately separated by a vector, h:</font><div align="right"><br>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Anisotropy in the spatial-correlation patterns of various material properties is expected in a layered sequence of rocks, such as those at Yucca Mountain.  Continuity of rock properties in the stratigraphically horizontal direction(s) generally should be greater than in the vertical direction. Although standard geostatistical practice is to fit model variograms to the sample data individually in each desired direction, these separate models cannot be used directly as input to the simulation algorithm.  Rather than attempt to compute the necessary spatial covariance values differently in different directions, it is typically the coordinate system describing samples and grid nodes that is modified to an isotropic system in which computation of the spatial covariance values is straightforward.  This process can be conceptualized by envisioning an ellipsoid in three dimensions, or a simple ellipse in two dimensions, for which all points on the surface are at the same structural (geologic) distance, as opposed to the same Euclidean distance (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/ba7d70313c6f6081882566ad00759379?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-43b</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  Anisotropy is then described in terms of the stretching and rotation that would be necessary to transform a sphere (circle) into an ellipsoid with specified major, intermediate, and minor axes.

A hole-effect variogram is defined by a variance that increases and then decreases with increasing separation between pairs of samples; typically there is some sort of approximately periodic relationship between the peaks and troughs.  The hole effect is so named because it is most frequently observed when computing sample variograms down vertical drill holes in a horizontally layered lithologic sequence.  When variograms are computed for such a layered sequence, two relatively similar layers may be separated by a layer of somewhat different character. At small intersample distances, one is comparing essentially only samples from within the same unit. As the distance between sample pairs increases, one begins to compare across the different units, leading to higher computed variability.  However, as the separation increases further, one begins to compare samples located in the more similar units straddling the intervening layer and the computed variability thus decreases.</font>

Much of the hole-effect character of the vertical variogram is attributed to the inclusion of a number of somewhat different lithologic units within the combined Calico Hills-Prow Pass model unit.  The principal contributor to the hole-effect phenomenon is most likely the so-called Prow Pass welded thermal/mechanical unit of Ortiz et al. (1985).

Although Prow Pass unit 3 does appear to constitute an identifiable lithostratigraphic unit that is typically welded, the degree of welding is markedly less than that of the welded units within the overlying Paintbrush Group, and the effect of the welding process on porosity is entirely different.  This distinction in welding based on material properties has been noted previously by Schenker et al. (1995, Appendix III).  In most boreholes, the porosity values through much of the Prow Pass unit 3 interval approximate those of the nonwelded tuffs enclosing this unit. </font>

Simulated models of secondary rock properties demonstrated to be strongly correlated with porosity, specifically saturated hydraulic conductivity and thermal conductivity, were created using methods of linear co-regionalization (Journel and Huijbregts 1978; Altman et al. 1996; Rautman and McKenna 1997).  The overall statistical and spatial continuity properties of the secondary variables are thus preserved, even though direct conditioning by measured secondary-property values is not possible with this technique.

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Air-injection testing has been and continues to be conducted in the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain to determine the field-scale bulk permeability, porosity, and anisotropy of the rock units that comprise, overly, and underlie the potential repository horizon.  Permeability, along with gradient, controls the flux of fluids (gas and water) through Yucca Mountain; pneumatic porosity controls the velocity of pressure fronts; and anisotropy controls the direction of fluid flow through Yucca Mountain (LeCain et al. 1997). These are critical parameters required for all analytical and numerical models that attempt to predict fluid flow through the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain.  For the nonwelded and bedded units (such as the PTn unit), air-injection tests provide field-scale measurements of the intergranular (or matrix) permeability and porosity.  For the highly fractured units (such as the TSw unit), air-injection tests provide measurements of the bulk permeability and porosity of the fracture network.

Only single-hole tests were conducted in the surfaced-based boreholes because of the relatively large distances between them.  However, in the Exploratory Studies Facility alcoves, the horizontal boreholes were drilled close enough together to have allowed cross-hole air-injection tests in addition to single-hole tests.  In the Exploratory Studies Facility alcove boreholes, cross-hole gaseous tracer tests also were conducted to estimate effective porosity and tortuosity.  Effective porosity controls the velocity of mass transport through Yucca Mountain and tortuosity controls the actual pathway of transport.  Accurate effective porosity values are required to estimate transport times for fluid flow through the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain.</font>

These alcoves include the upper Tiva Canyon alcove, the Bow Ridge fault alcove, and the upper Paintbrush contact alcove.  Testing was conducted in the upper Tiva Canyon alcove to confirm the gaseous-phase properties of the Tiva Canyon Tuff determined through investigations in surface-based boreholes.  Testing in the Bow Ridge fault alcove was intended to determine the properties of the Bow Ridge fault zone and the extent to which it may be a fast pathway for the flow of fluids (gas and water).  Testing in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove was intended to determine the properties of the transition zone between the TCw hydrogeologic unit and the PTn hydrogeologic unit.  The properties of the TCw hydrogeologic unit-PTn hydrogeologic unit contact are important because of the potential for lateral flow of water at this horizon above the potential repository (see Subsection 5.3.3.1.1.5).</font>

Injection-interval differential pressures were up to 165 kPa in the upper Tiva Canyon alcove boreholes, 64 kPa in the Bow Ridge fault alcove, and 111 kPa in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove.  Turbulence was identified as a decrease in calculated permeability with increasing flow rate and corrected.  Single-hole and cross-hole air-injection tests were conducted in the upper Tiva Canyon alcove and the Bow Ridge fault alcove to determine field-scale air permeability and, in the Bow Ridge fault alcove, porosity.  In addition, cross-hole gaseous tracer tests were conducted in the Bow Ridge fault alcove to determine field-scale effective porosity.

Three subhorizontal boreholes were drilled in the upper Tiva Canyon alcove for the radial borehole test: RBT#1, RBT#2, and RBT#3.  Borehole RBT#1 penetrates an ashflow tuff, pale reddish-brown to pale red, densely welded, and devitrified with 10 to 20 percent pumice, 2 to 5 percent phenocrysts, and 10 to 12 percent lithophysal cavities.  Borehole RBT#2 penetrates an ashflow tuff, pale reddish-brown, grayish-red, and brownish-gray, moderately to densely welded, and devitrified with 10 to 20 percent pumice, 2 to 5 percent phenocrysts, and 10 percent lithophysal cavities.  Borehole RBT#2 penetrates an ashflow tuff, pale reddish-brown, grayish-red, and brownish-grey, moderately to densely welded, and devitrified with 5 to 10 percent pumice, 2 to 10 percent phenocrysts, and 5 percent lithophysal cavities.  At a depth of 13.7 m the phenocrysts content increases to 10 percent.  Borehole RBT#3 penetrates an ashflow tuff, pale red to grayish-red, moderately to densely welded, and devitrified with 3 to 5 percent pumice, decreasing with depth, 3 to 7 percent phenocrysts, and 8 to 15 percent lithophysal cavities (LeCain et al. 1997).</font>

Water-redistribution pressures were monitored during the tests to estimate near-field capillary pressure, which is discussed in more detail below.  Because the boreholes had very high rugosity due to the lithophysal cavities and caving, the ability to isolate test intervals with pneumatic packers was limited and resulted in a limited number of test intervals.  Successful air-injection tests were conducted on 25 percent of RBT#1, 55 percent of RBT#2, and 21 percent of RBT#3. </font>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Although cross-hole air-injection testing was conducted between the three radial boreholes in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove from May to July 1995, these tests found no pneumatic connections between the air-injection intervals and the monitor intervals, thus precluding gaseous tracer tests.  Analytical predictions based on an equivalent porous medium using the single-hole air-permeability values indicated that the gas-injection rates and pressure transducer sensitivity should have been sufficient to provide cross-hole pressure responses.  Thus the failure of the cross-hole tests was attributed to the complex nature of the fracture network.  To help understand these complexities, Anna (1998) used the Exploratory Studies Facility fracture mapping data to develop a stochastic fracture network of the upper Paintbrush contact alcove.  An average of 422 fractures were generated and boreholes RBT#1, RBT#2, and RBT#3 had an average of 20, 22, and 21 single-fracture intersections, respectively.  An average of 53 fracture networks were connected to at least one borehole.  However, the connections between boreholes were sparse and composed of fractures connected in series.  The simulations indicated that few fractures are connected from source to sink, implying that only a small percentage of the fractures comprise the flowpath from source to sink.  Twenty realizations were simulated to examine the fracture pneumatic connections between the radial boreholes.  Six realizations showed no fracture pneumatic connections, four showed a single pathway connection from source to sink, and ten showed two pathway connections from source to sink. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The fracture-network modeling indicates that at the scale of the radial boreholes (3 to 10 m), cross-hole testing must be analyzed using discrete fracture methods and that monitor intervals must isolate individual fractures (LeCain et al. 1997).  Further, the absence of any cross-hole pressure responses were due to the combination of a limited number of cross-hole fracture connections and the inability to isolate discrete fractures in the monitor and air-injection boreholes.  The caving and high rugosity of the boreholes severely limited the packer location and spacing and made it impossible to isolate individual fractures.  The non-ideal packer placement resulted in the lengths of the monitor intervals being expanded to up to 4 m and therefore the intervals intersected numerous fractures.  The pressure responses in the long monitor intervals represented a composite pressure response of several fractures as opposed to a discrete pressure response representing a single fracture.  Even if a fracture did connect a monitor interval and injection interval, the other fractures would act as constant-head boundaries preventing any pressure increase in the monitor interval.  The absence of any cross-hole pneumatic connections meant the cross-hole tracer testing could not be conducted.  Identification of connected pneumatic flowpaths is required before successful tracer tests can be conducted in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove boreholes. </font>

Comparing the mean permeability values of the Tpcpmn and the Tpcpll with the permeabilities of the Bow Ridge fault zone and the Tmbt1 indicates that the permeability of the Tpcpll is 5 to 10 times smaller than the other units.

To date, only two of the boreholes planned for the upper Paintbrush contact alcove radial boreholes test have been drilled: RBT#1 and RBT#4.  Borehole RBT#1 was drilled generally westward from the upper Paintbrush contact alcove in a &#8220;down-section&#8221; direction so as to penetrate the upper subunits of the PTn (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/7623557e102ed8bd882566ad0076e753?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-67</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  Borehole RBT #4 was drilled generally eastward from the upper Paintbrush contact alcove in an &#8220;up-section&#8221; direction so as to penetrate the lower subunits of the TSw.  The first 4.8 m RBT#1 are in the Tpcplnc, which is an ashflow tuff, pale red to light brown, devitrified, with 8 to 15 percent pumice, and 3 to 5 percent phenocrysts.  The welding decreases and the porosity increases with depth.  At a depth of 4.2 m, RBT#1 intersects the Tiva Canyon crystal-poor vitric subzone 2 (Tpcpv2) and at a depth of 12.2 m the borehole intersects the Tiva Canyon crystal-poor, vitric subzone 1 (Tpcpv1).  The Tpcpv1 and Tpcpv2 are pyroclastic-flow deposits, grayish orange to dark gray, vitric, with 3 to 12 percent pumice, 3 to 6 percent phenocrysts, within an argillic altered matrix.  Welding decreases with depth, becoming nonwelded at the Tpcpv2-Tpcpv1 contact at a depth of 25.3 m.  The Tpcpv1 and Tpcpv2 are the uppermost subunits of the PTn (see </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/417b8d1beba5e6c9882566ad0069f8de?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-13</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">), although the Tpcpv2 is a transition zone at many locations and generally is considered part of TSw.

The relatively large permeability values of the Tpcpv subzones, compared to the Tpcpln subzones, indicate significant fracturing in the less welded Tpcpv.  Twenty-two test intervals in boreholes RBT#1 and RBT#4 indicated water redistribution at pressures less than 95.2 kPa and one test interval in borehole RBT#1 had a water-redistribution pressure of less than 5.2 kPa.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Water-Redistribution Pressures as an Indication of Capillary Pressures</font></b><b><font size="4" face="WP TypographicSymbols">n</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During air-injection tests, occurrence of a &#8220;breakover&#8221; pressure response, or a decrease in pressure with time, indicates near-field redistribution of water.  Water redistribution occurs when the gas-injection pressure exceeds the capillary forces that hold water in the matrix pores and fractures (LeCain 1997).  The differential air-injection pressure at which water redistribution is identified can be interpreted to represent an upper limit of the near-field capillary pressure.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Water redistribution was not identified in many of the high-permeability test intervals in Exploratory Studies Facility alcove boreholes because their high permeability limited the maximum injection-interval differential pressures to a few kPa.  This is especially true in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove boreholes where 29 of the 41 test intervals had maximum differential air-injection pressures of 0.0 or less than about 5.0 kPa, and showed no water redistribution (LeCain et al. 1997).  However, the water-redistribution pressures for the remaining 12 intervals provide some insight on the in situ capillary pressures.  One test interval indicated a capillary pressure of less than 10 kPa, six indicated capillary pressures between 10 and 50 kPa, and two intervals indicated capillary pressures between 50 and 100 kPa.  Two intervals had water-redistribution pressures greater than 130.8 and 164.9 kPa.  The larger capillary pressures are significant because they indicate that water is being held in the rock matrix and very small fractures at pressures exceeding one atmosphere (about 100 kPa); therefore, the rocks are drier than those with smaller capillary pressures.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the Bow Ridge fault alcove, capillary pressures appeared to be significantly lower than in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove.  Of the 19 test intervals of borehole HPF#1 in the Bow Ridge fault alcove, four had capillary pressures of less than 10 kPa, six had capillary pressures between 10 and 50 kPa, one had a capillary pressure between 50 and 100 kPa, and eight intervals showed no water redistribution.  The maximum differential pressure in the eight test intervals that did not show water redistribution was 12.5 kPa, indicating that the limited gas-injection rate and low test-interval pressure due to high permeability was the reason no water redistribution was identified. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">However, capillary pressures in the upper Tiva Canyon alcove were as large as in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove.  Of the 29 upper Paintbrush contact alcove test intervals, six had capillary pressures of less than 10 kPa, 10 had capillary pressures between 10 and 50 kPa, six had capillary pressures between 50 and 100 kPa, and seven intervals showed no water redistribution, three of which had differential pressures near or greater than 100 kPa.  Once again, the larger capillary pressures are significant because they indicate that water is being held in the rock matrix and very small fractures at pressures exceeding one atmosphere.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In contrast, the rocks that show water redistribution at relatively low differential pressures also exhibit low capillary pressures.  Overall, the water-redistribution data indicate that about 20 percent of test intervals had capillary pressures less than 20 kPa, indicating that these intervals have higher saturations than previously documented.  (A capillary pressure of 20 kPa is equivalent to a water potential of about  0.2 bar, which is somewhat wetter than the  3.0 to  1.0 bar water potentials measured in surface-based boreholes (J.P. Rousseau et al., Eds., </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hydrogeology of the Unsaturated Zone, North Ramp Area of the Exploratory Studies Facility, Yucca Mountain, Nevada</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, Milestone Report 3GUP667M, U.S. Geological Survey, in press, MOL.19980220.0164) in the TSw and the PTn.)  Based on the pore size distributions from Anderson (1991), the matrix characteristics curves of Klavetter and Peters (1987), and those presented in Subsection 5.3.3.1.1.4 of this report, the lower capillary pressures indicate that all the matrix pores and the smaller fractures (aperture less than 14 µm) of these intervals are saturated.  These wetter capillary pressures could indicate a potential for significant microfracture (apertures of 1 to 14 µm) water flow through the unsaturated zone.  The potential for water flow in microfractures through the unsaturated zone is consistent with recent estimates of an average percolation flux at Yucca Mountain of about 5 mm per year (Flint, A.L. et al. 1996).</font>

The larger air-permeability values for the Tiva Canyon Tuff obtained from pneumatic monitoring of boreholes SD-12 compared to those obtained from boreholes NRG-6 and NRG-7a may be due to the difference in the methods used (see J.P.

This is expected because at the scale of the air-injection tests (an ellipsoid with a zone of influence of approximately 4 m), the Tiva Canyon Tuff and the PTn are heterogeneous.  At the scale of the pneumatic-monitoring (40 to 200 m vertically), individual lithostratigraphic intervals must be combined and the heterogeneity indicated by the range in air-infection values is lost in the pneumatic-monitoring average permeability value. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In contrast, the pneumatic-monitoring permeability values for the Topopah Spring Tuff are an order of magnitude larger than the surface-based air-injection permeability values (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/67cef55b487e2d00882566ad006d401a?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-32</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  One possible explanation is that the permeability of the Topopah Spring Tuff is anisotropic (LeCain 1997).  Consequently, a vertical borehole that penetrates the Topopah Spring Tuff, which is dominated by vertical fractures, may intersect few fractures and, therefore, may not provide a representative permeability value from in situ air-injection testing.  Because the air-injection test intervals may have poor pneumatic connections to the vertical fracture system, the test-interval permeability value will be dominated by the poor connection, not by the vertical fracture permeability.  Therefore, the air-injection permeability values may be more representative of the horizontal permeability of the Topopah Spring Tuff than the vertical permeability.  In the pneumatic monitoring, pressure responses are controlled by transmission through the vertical fractures.  Even if a pneumatic-monitor interval itself has a poor pneumatic connection to the vertical fracture system, the pneumatic-monitor interval pressure response still is controlled by the vertical fracture system because of the relatively large scale (40 to 200 m vertically) of the pressure measurements.  Thus, the air-injection values most closely represent the horizontal permeability and the pneumatic-monitoring values most closely represent the vertical permeability, resulting in a significant vertical-to-horizontal anisotropy ratio.  The apparent anisotropy of the Topopah Spring Tuff has been noted in other studies including Rousseau et al. (1997), which concluded that the ratio of vertical-to-horizontal permeability in the Topopah Spring Tuff is 3:1 to 10:1.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Like the Topopah Spring Tuff, the Tiva Canyon Tuff contains an abundance of vertical fractures.  However, comparison of the air-injection and pneumatic-monitoring permeability values (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/67cef55b487e2d00882566ad006d401a?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-32</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, with the exception of borehole SD-12) suggests that the Tiva Canyon Tuff may have a larger horizontal air permeability than vertical, at least in certain locations such as in the vicinity of Drill Hole Wash.  The larger horizontal permeability of the Tiva Canyon Tuff may be because of a higher density of horizontal fractures.  As indicated in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/35c150ee94b92bd9882566ad006c1f54?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-26</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, boreholes NRG-6 and NRG-7a have fracture densities in the Tiva Canyon Tuff that are about four times larger than in the Topopah Spring Tuff.  A possible explanation for this apparent higher density of horizontal fractures could be the thinner overburden and associated stress-relief opening of the horizontal fractures (LeCain 1997). </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When comparing air-injection and pneumatic-monitoring permeability values, it is important to keep in mind that the pneumatic-monitoring permeability values are derived from a pneumatic-diffusivity model (J.P. Rousseau et al., Eds., </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hydrogeology of the Unsaturated Zone, North Ramp Area of the Exploratory Studies Facility, Yucca Mountain, Nevada</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, Milestone Report 3GUP667M, U.S. Geological Survey, in press, MOL.19980220.0164; Weeks 1978).  Because the pneumatic-diffusivity term has permeability in the numerator and porosity in the denominator, the calculated permeability value will be different for a different assumed value of porosity while the pneumatic-diffusivity term remains constant.  Thus, if the effective air-filled porosity is actually one-half the estimated value, then the calculated permeability values also will be half (LeCain 1997).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Assuming that air-injection permeability values obtained from vertical boreholes are more representative of the formation horizontal permeability, and that air-injection permeability values from horizontal boreholes in the Exploratory Studies Facility are more representative of the formation vertical permeability, comparison of the air-permeability values for the Tpcpll obtained from the Bow Ridge fault alcove and those obtained from the surface-based boreholes (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/67cef55b487e2d00882566ad006d401a?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Table 5.3-32</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">) indicates that the permeability of the Tpcpll is anisotropic with an average horizontal-to-vertical ratio of approximately 10:1 (LeCain et al. 1997).  The anisotropy is not a function of depth because the boreholes in the Bow Ridge fault alcove and test intervals in the surface-based boreholes are located at about the same depths below ground surface (30 to 40 m).  However, the apparent anisotropy of the Tpcpll may be due to the limited spatial distribution of testing locations and the small databases for the Bow Ridge fault alcove and surface-based permeability values.  Anisotropy of the Tpcpln in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove is dependent on which of the surface-based boreholes is used for comparison.  Comparisons with SD-12 and NRG-6 indicate isotropy while comparisons with UZ-16 and NRG-7a indicate anisotropy with a vertical to horizontal ratio of up to 10:1.  The 17 test intervals of the Tpcpln in the upper Paintbrush contact alcove have air-permeability values that range from 0.02 to 12.0 × 10</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">-12</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> (LeCain and Patterson 1997; LeCain 1998), indicating that it probably is not valid to compare an average of 17 tests to the single value of UZ-16 or the two values of NRG-7a.  Therefore, based on the limited database, the Tpcpln appears to be isotropic.  Significantly, considering the predominance of vertical fracturing in the Tiva Canyon Tuff (Beason et al. 1996; Barr, D.L. et al. 1996), there is no indication that the vertical permeability of the Tpcpln is greater than the horizontal permeability.  The small database of surface-based values for the Tpcpv (two test intervals) indicates that the air permeability of the Tpcpv is anisotropic with a vertical-to-horizontal ratio of about 80:1 (LeCain and Patterson 1997; LeCain 1998). </font>

The intrinsic permeability of a geologic material is a measure of the ease with which it transmits fluids and is usually expressed in the units of darcies or millidarcies (md) in Yucca Mountain reports.  Values of intrinsic permeability reported in Subsection 5.3.3.2.1 were determined by laboratories that analyzed samples primarily for geophysical properties or for characterizing unsaturated flow of both water and air.  For hydrologic investigations, hydraulic conductivity is the more common parameter that describes the ease of water movement through water-saturated rock or soil.

Ideally, rock-mass hydraulic characteristics are determined for a hydrogeologic unit (usually an aquifer) of stratigraphically defined thickness, but in reality they commonly are determined for the thickness actually tested, whether that is the saturated-zone depth penetrated by a borehole or the thickness of an interval of a borehole that is mechanically isolated by inflatable packers.  The results of tests to determine rock-mass properties are given in Subsection 5.3.3.2.2.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Transmissivity is the parameter used to describe the capability of a specified rock mass to transmit water.  It is the volumetric flux (L</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/T) that would be transmitted by the entire thickness of the interval under a unit hydraulic gradient.  It has units of L</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/T, dimensionally equivalent to those of hydraulic conductivity times the unit thickness.  Networks of interconnected fractures usually are orders of magnitude more permeable than the rock matrix, so a fractured rock mass normally has a much larger transmissivity than would be predicted by multiplying its matrix hydraulic conductivity by the thickness.  &#8220;Apparent hydraulic conductivity&#8221; is used in many Yucca Mountain reports to normalize tested thicknesses for qualitatively comparing the results of hydraulic tests.  It is calculated by dividing the primary test result, transmissivity, by the tested thickness.  It may include the matrix properties of multiple rock types as well as the typically dominant properties of fractures.  Therefore, comparisons with matrix hydraulic conductivity determined for cores can be very misleading.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Storativity, or the storage coefficient, relates the change in the volume of water in a rock unit (ideally, in a defined aquifer) to the change in hydraulic head.  It is the change in the volume (L</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">) of water in a unit square (L</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">) of the full thickness of the tested unit when the head changes one unit (L); therefore, it is dimensionless.  Determination of the storage coefficient requires measurements in an observation well during the transient drawdown due to pumping another well, and the results are commonly ambiguous.  It is not required to describe or model flow in steady-state systems, but at least reasonable estimates are needed to assess the effects of changed groundwater flux through the system, such as might result from climate change.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Solute transport in both steady-state and transient groundwater systems is sensitive to effective porosity, which is conceptually simple but elusive to determine.  Conceptually, it is the part of the porosity that preferentially permits the flow of water.  The Darcian flow velocity divided by the effective porosity ideally would provide the seepage velocity.  However, in a fractured, faulted rock mass, there is a wide distribution of permeability that defies precise measurement and description.  In the practical sense, effective porosity is incorporated into a set of dispersion coefficients that are determined in tracer tests and large-scale geochemical investigations.  Consequently, it is not considered further in the hydrogeology section but, rather, is deferred to later discussions of transport characteristics of Yucca Mountain.</font>

Although the vertical permeability generally decreases with an increase in depth, the distribution for values of horizontal permeability is fairly scattered.</font>

Data for core analyses from two of the drillholes, UE-25a #1 (Anderson 1981) and SD-7 (Rautman and Engstrom 1996a) are for intervals of strata intermittently dispersed through most of the unit including 146 and 149 m (480 and 490 feet) of section, respectively.  Core from two more drillholes USW G-4 (Anderson 1994) and SD-9 (Engstom and Rautman 1996), provide data from intermittently spaced intervals with less complete coverage of the sequence, 105 and 99 m (345 and 325 feet) of section, respectively.  Data for these and for samples from smaller sections of the Prow Pass unit at six other drillholes, UE-25b #1(Lahoud et al. 1984), USW G-1 (Flint, L.E. and Flint 1990), USW G-3 (Anderson 1994), USW H-1 (Rush et al. 1984), J-13 (Thordarson 1983), and USW SD-12 (Rautman and Engstrom 1996b) show the range in matrix porosity is 19.0 to almost 39 percent, with a mean value of 24 percent.

At USW H-1(Rush et al. 1984) and UE-25b #1 (Lahoud et al. 1984), only two samples each are provided.  These samples are from intervals at approximately 74 and 75 m (243 and 246 feet) below the upper unit contact at USW H-1, and 140 and 145 m (459 and 476 feet) below the unit top at UE-25b #1. Drillholes SD-7 (Rautman and Engstrom 1996a) and SD-12 (Rautman and Engstrom 1996b) provide core from intervals distributed through the majority of the Prow Pass section (78 and 90 percent, respectively), but SD-9 penetrated only the upper 73 m (241 feet) (Engstrom and Rautman 1996).  Values for horizontal hydraulic conductivity range between zero and 0.013 m/day, with a mean of 1 x 10-5 m/day; neither the untransformed nor natural log of estimates are normally distributed.  The largest conductivity in the Prow Pass Tuff, 0.013 m/day, occurs at about 30 m (100 feet) below the upper contact of the unit at SD-12, at approximately 530 m (1,740 feet) below the surface (Rautman 1996).  The geologic core log for drillhole SD-12 notes slickensides were reported in an interval about one meter below the core sample location.  Comparisons of data and associated depths of core recovery from single drillholes, as well as comparison of the compiled data and associated depth of core recovery that is considered here, indicate there are no trends in horizontal hydraulic conductivity associated with depth for the Prow Pass Tuff.  Review of values at each drillhole location versus the northern coordinate for drillholes from which data are derived indicates a relatively large distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the Prow Pass Tuff at each drillhole location and also indicates there is no notable change in the parameter with latitude across the Yucca Mountain vicinity.  The mean for all values composing the sample population compared to the mean value at each drillhole indicates a variance from the population mean of about one order of magnitude also would suggest relatively consistent hydraulic conductivity in the Prow Pass unit. </font>

The other analysis was for core taken 53 m (175 feet) deeper and was an order of magnitude smaller, 1.7 x 10-6 m/day.  At USW H-1 (Rush et al. 1984), the analyses were for samples within one meter of one another at about 640 m (2,100 feet) depth, and resulted in comparable values of approximately 6.0 x 10-5 m/day.

Intermittently spaced core samples also were recovered from an interval about 27 m (90 feet) thick in the lower part of the unit at USW G-1 (Flint, L.E. and Flint 1990), an upper through middle interval about 70 m (229 feet) thick and spanning approximately 70 percent of the Prow Pass at USW G-3 (Anderson 1994), and intermittently throughout the 122 m (400 feet) thick interval at USW G-4 (Anderson 1994).

Drillholes UE-25c #1, -25c #2, -c25#3 (Geldon 1993, 1996); USW G-3 and USW G-4 (Anderson 1994); and USW H-1 (Rush et al. 1984) were cored at intervals through all or nearly all of the Bullfrog Tuff thickness.  Core from intervals spanning approximately 90 percent of the reported unit thickness were collected for analyses from drillholes UE-25b #1 (Lahoud et al. 1984) and SD-7 (Rautman and Engstrom 1996a).  Core from drillhole J-13 (Thordarson 1983) represents sampling from about 82 percent of the total penetrated thickness.  The Bullfrog Member was not completely penetrated at UE-25a #1 (Anderson 1981), and it isn&#8217;t certain how representative this sampling is.  However, this drillhole is proximal to USW H-1 and UE-25b #1 where the Bullfrog Tuff is 113 m (371 feet) and 99 m (325 feet thick), respectively, allowing one to estimate that the upper 35 m (115 feet) interval from which core was recovered at UE-25a #1 would represent less than half the entire unit.  Finally, one sample was recovered from drillhole SD-12 (Rautman and Engstrom 1996b).  Descriptions of welding indicate the tuff is variably welded, alternating between nonwelded and moderately to densely welded throughout the sections at each drillhole.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Matrix porosity data for the Bullfrog Tuff are available from all noted drillholes, except the C-hole Complex.  These data indicate that the mean porosity value determined for drillholes generally decreases to the south across the Yucca Mountain vicinity.  The mean for the compiled data was 19 percent, and data are not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk W Test number of 0.93).  Comparison of data suggests an increase in porosity for the Bullfrog Tuff only generally correlates to depth.  An increase in welding may be associated with a decrease in the percent porosity.  Notwithstanding, porosities between 15 and 20 percent are not restricted to any particular class of welding and commonly occur in tuff samples varying from the least to the most welded.</font>

At drillhole USW H-1 (Rush et al. 1984) and UE-25b #1 (Lahoud et al. 1984), the reported total section thickness was 271 and 329 m (889 feet and 1,079 feet), respectively.  Of these four drillholes, only USW G-3 was sampled intermittently through almost the entire (97 percent) unit thickness.  At USW H-1, UE-25b #1, and J-13, core was recovered intermittently within intervals spanning between 72 to 85 percent of the total reported unit thickness.  At the C-hole Complex, the drillholes bottomed in the upper zone of the Tram Tuff (Geldon 1993); core samples were from the upper 83 to 101 m (272 to 330 feet).  At USW G-4 (Anderson 1994) and SD-7 (Rautman and Engstrom 1996a) core also were only from the uppermost interval of the unit.  A summary of welding descriptions for core samples from the noted drillholes indicates 64 percent of the Tram Tuff is nonwelded to partly welded.  At drillhole USW G-3 and UE-25b #1, most of the strata were described as partly to moderately welded, while core from the upper interval at the other drillholes was fairly consistently logged as nonwelded to partly welded, and the lower, deeper interval was usually described as partly to moderately welded.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Matrix porosity is characterized based on reports for five drillholes, USW H-1 (Rush et al. 1984), USW G-3 and -4 (Anderson 1984), UE-25b #1 (Lahoud et al. 1984), and J-13 (Thordarson 1983).  It is a normally distributed parameter, with a W Test value of 0.98.  Evaluation of porosity versus depth of sample reveals that the matrix porosity generally decreases with depth (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/cd7c50c50f9e7e2a882566ad007787b6?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-77</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">). </font>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hydraulic conductivities have been reported for core recovered from USW H-1 (Rush et al. 1984), UE-25b #1 (Lahoud et al. 1984), and SD-7 (Rautman and Engstrom 1996a).  Horizontal hydraulic conductivity ranges between zero and 4.0 x 10-4 m/day.  Vertical hydraulic conductivity ranges between zero and 5.0 x 10-4 m/day.  At drillhole USW H-1, where the greatest number of samples were analyzed, three were recovered in the upper 11 m (36 feet), and the remaining samples were recovered from the lowermost 107 m (350 feet) of the Tram Tuff.  A comparison of depth to vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity values at this one drillhole affirms the character of the whole sample population, for which changes in neither property are obviously correlative with depth.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Horizontal permeability analyses are available from UE-25c #1, -25c #2, and -25c #3 (Geldon 1996), and USW G-3 and USW G-4 (Anderson 1994).  Vertical permeability analyses were reported for only USW G-3 and USW G-4 (Anderson 1994).  The degree of welding does not noticeably influence the permeability, and there are no consistent trends in these parameters associated with an increase in depth.  Neither parameter displays a normal distribution.  Values for horizontal permeability range between zero and 5.2 md, with a mean of 0.13 md.  Based on statistical analysis using the Mahalanobish distance (SAS Institute, Inc. 1996), the maximum value of 5.2 md, which was calculated for a sample from USW G-3, is an outlier.  Anderson (1994, p. 20) suggested that some of the larger discrepancies in permeability between sample pairs, where a pair includes vertical and horizontal permeability calculations for samples collected at the same interval within individual tuff members and for various stratigraphic units, could be caused by the occurrence of an unequal orientation or distribution of microfractures.  Evaluation of the sample population without this datum results in a sample mean of 0.05 md.  In the C-hole Complex, the horizontal permeability in the Tram Tuff is typically about 1.0 x 10-2 md; the exception is in the uppermost 30 feet interval at UE-25c #1 where it is 3.0 x 10-1 md.  Horizontal permeability in the Tram Tuff is often less at the C-hole Complex than at USW G-3, where the maximum sample permeability, 5.2 md, occurs at 1,070 m (3,511 feet) depth.  Analyses of core samples recovered at USW G-4 provide values for horizontal permeability in the Tram Tuff that range between 1.0 x 10-1 and 2.6 x 10-1 md and also indicate a commonly larger horizontal permeability there than at the C-hole Complex.  Vertical permeability in the Tram Tuff ranged between a minimum of zero and maximum of 33.7 md, with a median of 9.0 x 10-3 md.  Similar to horizontal permeability, the maximum vertical permeability was measured for core recovered from USW G-3.

These reports are for drillholes USW H-1, where 320 m (1,049 feet) of the Older Tuffs were penetrated (Rush et al. 1984), and USW G-3, where only 47.5 m (156 feet) of the Older tuffs were penetrated (Anderson 1994).  At USW H-1, two core samples from approximately 61 m (200 feet) below the upper unit contact were recovered for analyses.  At USW G-3, core samples were recovered at approximately 17, 37, and 47 m (55, 122, and 154 feet) below the uppermost contact depth.  Although core analyses were not performed, the Older Tuffs also were penetrated at USW G-1 and UE-25p #1.  At USW G-1, where 323 m (1,060 feet) of the Older Tuffs were drilled, Spengler, Byers et al. (1981) reported the drillhole bottomed in the tuffs.  At UE-25p #1, where the base of the Older Tuffs was drilled through, the total thickness was reported as about 75 m (246 feet).  The variance in thickness could be due to a thinning or faulting of strata.  It may also be due to the depths being estimated to include other Tertiary Tuffs lying between the Older Tuffs and the Paleozoic carbonate strata (Craig and Robison 1984).  At USW G-3, the Older Tuffs are described as zeolitized ashflow and bedded tuff that is nonwelded (Anderson 1994) and at USW H-1, they are described as partly to moderately welded (Rush et al. 1984).  The few available data did not allow for detection of trends in hydraulic parameters with an increase in depth, or to determine lateral trends in properties.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Evaluation of porosity values for the Older Tuff indicates they are moderately normally distributed, with a W Test number of 0.95.  Based on the three core analyses for the unit at USW G-3 (Anderson 1994) and two from USW H-1 (Rush et al. 1984) porosity ranges between 10.0 and 19.3 percent.  Based on the same two samples from USW H-1, an average vertical hydraulic conductivity of 2.0 x 10-4 m/day and an average horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 1.8 x 10-4 m/day were determined for the Older tuffs.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The three core analyses from USW G-3 (Anderson 1994) also provided estimates for vertical and horizontal permeabilities.  The minimum and maximum vertical permeability were 7.0 x 10-3 and 3.8 x 10-2 md, respectively.  Although the sample population was relatively small, vertical- permeability values were determined to have a normal distribution, for which the W Test number of 0.99; the horizontal permeability with a similar range of 9.0 x 10-3 md to 4.1 x 10-2 md, was determined to not be normally distributed.</font>

<p><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Summary</font></i><b><font size="4" face="WP TypographicSymbols">n</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The compilation and synthesis of core data presented here may be used to describe the apparent attributes of the stratigraphic units.  However, summaries of parameter distributions do not incorporate evaluation of the relation of the areal lithologic variance of units or the impacts of structural deformation or geochemical alteration, so that descriptions of vertical or lateral trends in the hydraulic or physical rock properties are considered preliminary.  The relation of these features to the distribution and transition in parameter values for stratigraphic units is considered significant (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, p.17) and should be determined for a comprehensive description of the saturated zone groundwater flow system at Yucca Mountain.  For example, Rautman and Engstrom (1996a, p.13) and Ortiz et al. (1985, p.8) recognize that rock units at the Yucca Mountain Site are more clearly defined based on porosity, grain density, and thermal properties rather than on the basis of permeability, which probably is more sensitive to geochemical processes and mechanical strain. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Although the Topopah Spring Tuff is part of the saturated zone system in the more southerly extent of the site area, it is mostly included in the unsaturated-zone system and the reader is referred to that subsection of this document for detailed evaluation of this unit.  The core data generally confirm that porosity, permeability, and hydraulic conductivity for the Topopah Spring Tuff are commonly less that those for the stratigraphically lower middle volcanic aquifer strata.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Based on referenced data, the largest matrix porosity is in the Calico Hills Formation, for which estimates range between 11.8 and 47 percent, with a mean of about 28 percent.  In the volcanic tuffs that compose both the Crater Flat Group and the Lithic Ridge Tuff, the mean matrix porosity is 21 percent.  In the deeper tuffs of the lower volcanic confining unit, the mean porosity was estimated as approximately 15 percent.  The lowest horizontal porosity estimates were for the dolomites composing the lower carbonate aquifer, where values ranged between about 5 percent in the Lone Mountain Dolomite and 0.3 percent in the Roberts Mountain Formation.  The trend through the volcanic strata in a descending order below the Topopah Spring Tuff, then, is to transition from the most porous unit in the upper interval in the saturated zone, through the less porous tuffs including the Crater Flat Group and Lithic Ridge Tuff.  The least matrix porosity occurs in the underlying lower carbonate aquifer (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/7807cf873e03af9d882566ad007787b8?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-79</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The likeness between the Calico Hills Formation and Prow Pass Tuff has been characterized by  Rautman and McKenna (1997, p. 6) in work to model 3-D thermal hydrological and thermal properties at Yucca Mountain.  Based on material properties including porosity the author treated the Calico Hills Formation and Prow Pass Tuff as a distinct unit.  The high degree of normality (the Shapiro-Wilks test resulted in 0.99) for the distribution of the combined porosity data would confirm the likeness of the two strata.  Notwithstanding, a comparison of the estimates for the horizontal hydraulic conductivity indicates that with a mean of 0.61 m per day, the horizontal hydraulic conductivity for the Calico Hills Formation is three orders of magnitude larger than that for the Crater Flat Group, having a mean of 1.4 x 10-4 to 1.8 x 10-4 m per day (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/832f3d2de291aae0882566ad0072513b?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-80</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">With respect to the mean permeabilities estimated for the saturated zone units, except for the Lone Mountain Dolomite, plots for the log of both vertical and horizontal permeability from the uppermost through and including the lowermost units in the saturated zone strata indicate permeability decreases with depth (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/5406cb5c0b3b3667882566ad00786c95?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-81</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  The relatively large means for permeability in the Lone Mountain Dolomite are from Anderson (1991, p. 32), and may reflect the author&#8217;s observation that the orientation of open fractures could mean that some core samples were not suitable for measurement.  Consequently, these values are queried on </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/5406cb5c0b3b3667882566ad00786c95?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-81</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The matrix hydrologic properties for the saturated zone strata do not exhibit consistent lateral trends across the site area.  Data for Topopah Spring Tuff parameters indicate that overall, values do not significantly change.  Based on available data, horizontal hydraulic conductivity increases southward in the Calico Hills Formation and Tram Tuff and decreases in the Bullfrog Tuff; in the Prow Pass Tuff, there is no noticeable trend.  Lateral trends in permeability appear to be exist, where estimated values increase southward for the Calico Hills Formation and Prow Pass Tuff, but decrease within the lower members of the Crater Flat Group.  Values for matrix porosity indicate there is no clear lateral trend for the Calico Hills Formation, Prow Pass Tuff, or Tram Tuff.  The mean for porosities determined for the Bullfrog Tuff indicates the mean porosity at drillholes decreases approximately 10 percent (from about 22 to 12 percent) in a southward direction.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The comparability of the data for hydraulic conductivity (K) and those for permeability (k) was tested for corresponding sets of data means, each of which was based on data for 14 or more samples.  For the same stratigraphic unit and data type (horizontal versus vertical), the ratio k/K (both in m/day) ranged from 0.0003 to 210 K.  The range of values for both parameters are very large, indicating that the differences between the data sets could be valid.  However, the range of k/K over almost six orders of magnitude indicates that the data should be applied with caution until the differences have been evaluated more thoroughly.</font>

Multiple-well pumping tests were conducted only at the C-hole Complex and, in limited fashion, between two boreholes in Drill Hole Wash.  The various hydraulic parameters discussed in the following subsection were determined mostly from single-borehole tests, although some results from the C-hole Complex are included.

Although this information is critical to determining the true groundwater flowpaths from the potential repository, only one test has been conducted at Yucca Mountain to determine whether or not the aquifers actually are anisotropic.  Erickson and Waddell (1985, pp. 24-29) reported that at borehole USW H-4, the maximum hydraulic conductivity was from 5 to 7 times greater than the minimum hydraulic conductivity; the maximum hydraulic conductivity was oriented in a direction 23</font><font size="4" face="WP MathA">E</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> east of north.  Czarnecki and Waddell (1984, pp. 27-28), however, reported that their subregional model duplicated measured water levels more accurately when the aquifer was simulated as isotropic than anisotropic.  Therefore, the question of anisotropy remains unresolved.  Recent long-term hydraulic testing at the C-hole Complex resulted in an apparent elliptical pattern in drawdown, oriented northwest-southeast (Geldon et al. 1997, pp. 42-44).  This pattern may indicate anisotropic conditions in that orientation.</font>

<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Flow Surveys</font></b><b><font size="4" face="WP TypographicSymbols">n</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Flow surveys were conducted in most of the deeper boreholes drilled at Yucca Mountain.  Flow surveys are useful to determine which intervals of the borehole, and possibly which fractures, produced water.  Most of the flow surveys were conducted using a tool developed for oil-field use that releases small quantities of radioactive iodine-131 (Blankennagel 1967, pp. 15-19).  As the iodine moves up or down the borehole, it is sensed by gamma-ray detectors.  Most surveys are done while water is being pumped from or injected into the borehole.  Static tests also were occasionally conducted (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, p. 37)</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Flow surveys are useful in determining which parts of the borehole produce (or accept) most of the flow.  The information is useful when subdividing a system into aquifers and confining units.  Minor producing intervals are not readily detected by this method.  Flow surveys generally report velocities to about 0.03 m/s, but the variability between successive measurements is considerably larger than 0.03 m/s.  Therefore, for borehole diameters generally found at Yucca Mountain, intervals producing less than 0.1 L/s can be easily missed.  Flow surveys for seven boreholes are shown in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/235a28b39bc321ac882566ad00786c97?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-83</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  For comparison purposes, the depths for all surveys were adjusted to a standard thickness of 524.3 m for the lower volcanic aquifer, which is the estimated thickness of this aquifer in borehole USW G-1, but it is not necessarily representative of the thickness of the aquifer elsewhere (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, p. 37).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The flow surveys generally indicated that production (or acceptance) of water occurred in a few intervals.  Boreholes USW H-1 and USW H-5 are the most dramatic examples of this generalization.  In borehole USW H-1, 64 percent of the production came from a 1-m interval, whereas in borehole USW H-5, 73 percent of the production came from a 42-m interval.  Boreholes USW H-4 and UE-25b #1 had production from larger intervals.  All of the boreholes had little production (or acceptance) of water from their lower intervals (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, p. 37).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">None of the boreholes for which flow surveys were conducted had major production from the lower volcanic confining unit, but borehole USW H-4 produced about 12 percent of its flow from the uppermost part of that unit.  The upper volcanic confining unit is saturated only in boreholes UE-25b #1 and USW G-2 (</font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/235a28b39bc321ac882566ad00786c97?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-83</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">).  The upper confining unit produced approximately one-third of the water in borehole UE-25b #1 and accepted virtually all the water in the test at borehole USW G-2.  The lower volcanic aquifer did not accept any water in the test at borehole USW G-2 despite being fully penetrated.  At the C-hole Complex, flow surveys indicated that the lower volcanic aquifer produced virtually all the flow, but temperature surveys indicated that the upper volcanic confining unit produced some water in borehole UE-25c #3 and possibly in borehole UE-25c #2 (Geldon 1993, Figures 31-33).  The upper volcanic aquifer is above the saturated zone in all of the boreholes shown in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/235a28b39bc321ac882566ad00786c97?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Figure 5.3-83</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  No flow surveys were available from boreholes that penetrated the upper volcanic aquifer in the saturated zone, but hydraulic tests at borehole UE-25 J-13 indicated that most of the production was from the upper volcanic aquifer (Thordarson 1983, Table 12).  At borehole USW VH-1 in Crater Flat, most of the production came from the lower volcanic aquifer (Thordarson and Howells 1987, p. 9), whereas the upper volcanic aquifer produced little water.  The upper volcanic confining unit is absent at this borehole (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, pp. 37, 39).</font>

Results from these tests, combined with results from subsequent tests, are summarized below.</font>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Additionally, it was hoped that monitoring UE-25p #1 might establish whether the tuffaceous rocks are connected hydraulically to the Paleozoic carbonate rocks, a regional aquifer.  The Paleozoic rocks are estimated to be about 455 m below the bottom of the C-holes.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the hydraulic tests conducted from 1983 to 1997 that are listed above, the C-holes were either open or contained packers to isolate one or more intervals.  Intervals to be packed off were determined from flow surveys, geophysical logs, and aquifer tests conducted between 1983 and 1995.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Six hydrogeologic intervals exist in the C-holes: Calico Hills, Prow Pass, Upper Bullfrog, Lower Bullfrog, Upper Tram, and Lower Tram.  Flow within these intervals comes from diversely oriented fractures and the interstices of variably welded ashflow, ashfall, and reworked tuff.  During hydraulic tests, the Lower Bullfrog interval contributes about 70 percent of the flow, the Upper Tram interval contributes about 20 percent of the flow, and all other intervals combined contribute about 10 percent of the flow.  Because these hydrogeologic intervals are defined by spatially related faults and fracture zones, their existence and hydraulic properties cannot be extended beyond the immediate vicinity of the C-holes.  However, the results of hydraulic tests in the C-holes imply that the transmissivity of a rock mass is relatively large close to faults and associated fracture zones, and decreases with distance from these features.  Although this result is based on observations at the C-hole Complex in the vertical direction, it is believed that the same principle can be applied areally.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In all hydraulic tests at the C-hole Complex, large, rapid drawdown (and recovery) in the pumping well far exceeded what could have been predicted from hydraulic properties calculated from observation-well drawdown in the same tests.  Most of this pumping-well drawdown probably can be attributed to frictional head loss or &#8220;borehole skin.&#8221;  Because the pumping-well drawdown largely is independent of aquifer properties, analyses of this drawdown result in misleadingly small values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity.  Hydraulic tests at the C-hole Complex imply that analyses of pumping-well drawdown throughout the Yucca Mountain area may be one to two orders of magnitude too low.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hydrogeologic intervals in the C-holes have layered heterogeneity.  The Calico Hills interval is unconfined, the Prow Pass and Upper Bullfrog intervals are confined, the Lower Bullfrog interval is a fissure-block aquifer, and the Upper Tram interval receives flow from crosscutting faults in response to pumping.  Transmissivity increases downhole from 4-10 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d in the Calico Hills interval to 1,300 to 1,600 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d in the Lower Bullfrog interval, although this trend is reversed near the bottom of the C-holes.  In the Upper Tram interval, transmissivity is 800 to 900 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d.  Hydraulic conductivity increases downhole from 0.1 to 0.2 m/d in the Calico Hills interval to 20 to 50 m/d in the Lower Bullfrog and Upper Tram intervals.  Storativity in UE-25c #2 generally increases downhole from 0.0002 to 0.0004 in the Calico Hills and Prow Pass intervals to 0.001 to 0.002 in the Lower Bullfrog and Upper Tram intervals, although the storativity of the Upper Bullfrog interval is an order of magnitude smaller than in other intervals above the Lower Bullfrog.  Storativity in the Prow Pass and Upper Bullfrog intervals of UE-25c #1 is similar to that in UE-25c #2, but the storativity of the Lower Bullfrog and Upper Tram intervals in UE-25c #1 is about one-tenth of that in UE-25c #2.  Vertical distributions of hydraulic properties in the C-holes are believed to represent the increasing influence of faults and related fractures toward the bottom of the boreholes.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Distributions of drawdown in the hydraulic tests conducted in May 1995 and from May 1996 to November 1997 were influenced strongly by northwesterly and northerly trending faults.   Drawdown in UE-25 ONC-1 in the latter test showed a fissure-block aquifer response, possibly because of fractures related to a northwesterly trending zone of discontinuous faults that extends between Bow Ridge and Antler Wash.  Drawdown in UE-25 WT#14 and USW H-4 during the same test reached steady state after 72,000 minutes of pumping because of recharge from the Paintbrush Canyon fault and a zone of northerly trending faults that transects Boundary Ridge.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Drawdown data from four wells monitored during the hydraulic test conducted from May 1996 to November 1997, matched to the type curve for a confined aquifer, indicated transmissivity of 2,200 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d and storativity of 0.002 for the Miocene tuffaceous rocks within a 21 km</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> area surrounding the C-holes.

Analyses of drawdown in the composite saturated-zone section of the C-holes in May 1995 and in outlying observation wells from May 1996 to November 1997 indicated that the transmissivity of the tuffaceous rocks decreases northwesterly from 2,600 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d in UE-25 WT#3, to about 2,000 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d in the C-holes, to 700 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d in USW H-4.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The hydraulic conductivity of the Miocene tuffaceous rocks, areally, ranges from less than 2 to more than 10 m/d.  It is largest where prominent, northerly trending faults are closely spaced or intersected by northwesterly trending faults.  Relatively large hydraulic conductivity occurs beneath Fran Ridge, Bow Ridge, and Boundary Ridge.  Hydraulic conductivity is smallest toward the crest of Yucca Mountain and Jackass Flats.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During the four hydraulic tests conducted at the C-hole Complex from 1995 to 1997 drawdown occurred in all monitored intervals of the C-holes and other observation wells, regardless of the geologic interval being pumped.  This hydraulic connection across geologic and lithostratigraphic contacts is believed to result from interconnected faults, fractures, and intervals with large matrix permeability.  Because flow is not strata bound, the Miocene tuffaceous rocks appear to be a single aquifer in the structural block bounded on the east by the Paintbrush Canyon fault, on the south by the Dune Wash fault, and on the west by faults cutting Boundary Ridge, at least as far north as lower Midway Valley.  This conclusion is supported by the ability to combine the drawdown from observation wells completed in different Miocene geologic units in the same analytical solution of drawdown as a function of time, or of drawdown as a function of distance.  Hydraulic tests at the C-hole Complex from 1995 to 1997 indicate that formal designation of aquifers and confining units within the Miocene tuffaceous sequence at Yucca Mountain may not be justified in areas containing interconnected faults and fractures.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Following the hydraulic test in February 1996 discussed above, during which quasi-steady-state conditions were reached, iodide, in the form of sodium iodide, was injected into borehole UE-25c #2 while UE-25c #3 continued to be pumped, in what was the first conservative tracer test at the C-hole Complex (Fahy 1997).  During the hydraulic test from May 1996 to November 1997 discussed above, additional conservative tracer tests and a multi-constituent reactive-tracer test were conducted.  The conservative tracer tests began concurrently in January 1997 and concluded when pumping stopped in November 1997.  While UE-25c #3 was being pumped to maintain a quasi-steady-state hydraulic gradient, a benzoic acid was injected into UE-25c #2, and a pyridone was injected into UE-25c #1.  The average discharge from UE-25c #3 during this test was about 8.9 liters per second.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The breakthrough curves from conservative tracer tests were fitted to an analytical solution of the advection-dispersion equation for a homogeneous, isotropic, dual-porosity medium (Moench 1995), and values of porosity and longitudinal dispersivity were calculated (Geldon et al. 1997).  Two porosity values were calculated for each tracer test.  The first is a &#8220;flow porosity,&#8221; which is attributable to a network of both continuous fractures, and discontinuous fractures connected by segments of matrix, that forms the flow pathway through which tracers move between the injection and recovery wells.  This flow pathway has high hydraulic conductivity, but low storage attributes.  The second porosity value determined from the breakthrough curve is a &#8220;storage porosity,&#8221; which is associated with the rock matrix surrounding the tracer flow pathway.  Tracers are assumed to enter and leave the rock matrix beyond the flow pathway by molecular diffusion according to Fick&#8217;s first law (Freeze and Cherry 1979).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Only the two conservative tracer tests from UE-25c #2 to UE-25c #3, representing a scale of approximately 30 m, have been analyzed definitively.  The values of flow porosity obtained range from 7 to 10 percent; the values of storage porosity obtained range from 9 to 19 percent, and the values of longitudinal dispersivity obtained range from 1.9 to 2.6 m.  The values of storage porosity above are consistent with porosity values of 12 to 43 percent determined by laboratory analyses of core from the C-holes and gamma-gamma logging in UE-25c #1 (Geldon 1993).</font>

The depth to water in UE-25b #1 was about 471 m in 1981.  A tracejector flow survey conducted in UE-25b #1 during the first hydraulic test indicated that the Bullfrog Tuff produces 49 percent of the flow, the Calico Hills Formation produces 32 percent of the flow, and the Prow Pass Tuff produces 19 percent of the flow in this borehole.  Total transmissive thickness in the borehole is 110 m. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Borehole UE-25a #1, which is about 110 m south-southwest of UE-25b #1, is 762 m deep and penetrates the Calico Hills Formation, Prow Pass Tuff, and Bullfrog Tuff below the water table (Spengler, Muller et al. 1979).  Splays of the Drill Hole Wash fault intersect the borehole at depths of 67 to 100, 125 to 130, 203 to 221, 372 to 415, and 739 to 762 m.  The borehole is open in the Bullfrog Tuff below a depth of 747 m.  Because the entire open interval is faulted and fractured, it is assumed to be transmissive.  No flow surveys have been run in the borehole to confirm this assumption.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Three open-hole hydraulic tests were conducted in borehole UE-25b #1 and monitored in borehole UE-25a #1 from August 3 to September 1, 1981 (Lahoud et al. 1984).  Discharge rates during these tests ranged from 13.8 to 37.0 liters per second, and the length of the tests ranged from 3 to 9 days.  Using a technique developed for a dual-porosity aquifer with fracture skin, Moench (1984) analyzed the combined drawdown data from the pumping and observation wells obtained during the third test and determined fracture transmissivity of 340 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d, matrix transmissivity of 14 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d, fracture hydraulic conductivity of 0.9 m/d, matrix hydraulic conductivity of 0.2 m/d, fracture storativity of 0.0006, and matrix storativity of 0.02.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A convergent tracer test was conducted in the Bullfrog Tuff at the Drill Hole Wash complex from June 23 to July 20, 1982 (Ogard et al. 1983).  UE-25a #1 was used as the injection well, and UE-25 b#1 was used as the recovery well during the test.  Assuming no collapse at the bottom of the well, the injection interval in UE-25a #1 was 15 m thick.  The recovery interval in UE-25 b#1, in part determined by emplaced packers, was 60 m thick.  Pumping to establish a steady-state hydraulic gradient for the tracer test began on June 22, 1982.  On June 23, about 20.5 hours later, bromide tracer, in the form of sodium bromide, was injected into UE-25a #1.  When pumping stopped on July 20, 1992, the tracer test ended.  Average discharge during the tracer test was 12.8 liters per second.  According to Ogard et al. (1983), the bromide concentration in water recovered from borehole UE-25 b#1 increased from about 90 parts per billion on June 25 to about 280 parts per billion on June 27 and then decreased to the detection limit of 80 parts per billion on July 17.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3.3.2.2.3  Uncertainty of Hydraulic Properties </font></b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">No matter how well the saturated-zone flow system at Yucca Mountain and vicinity is described, uncertainties of the data collected will always remain.  A wide variety of methods have been used to estimate transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, and aquifer storativity with mixed success and results (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, p. 32).  For the determination of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity, analysis of hydraulic tests require assumptions that frequently cannot be demonstrated to be correct.  For aquifer storage properties, a detailed discussion is not possible because so little data exists for storage properties. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity estimates based on hydraulic tests in boreholes are available from a variety of sources, which used a variety of methods for the Yucca Mountain area, but the analysis of the tests require assumptions that frequently cannot be demonstrated to be even approximately correct.  The reliability of the commonly used slug tests for estimating values of transmissivity in fractured tuff at Yucca Mountain is suspect in many cases, in part because the testing could have caused either elastic fracture dilatation or fracture-deformation by hydraulic fracturing of the rock mass (Thordarson et al. 1985, p. 19; Stock and Healy 1988).  Additionally, the results of many of these slug tests could not be analyzed reliably because conditions in the boreholes were not appropriate for the porous-medium type of analysis required of slug tests (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, p. 53).</font>

Transmissivity probably varies considerably around Yucca Mountain, but part of the range in values probably is due to uncertainty in the estimates.  There is uncertainty in how to interpret the results of individual aquifer tests.  Craig and Reed (1991, pp. 9-13) analyzed one aquifer test in borehole USW H-6 four different ways and got values of 240, 480, 210, and 370 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d.  They chose 240 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d as the most reasonable value.  The need to rely principally on single-borehole tests is a major cause of uncertainty in estimating both transmissive and storage properties. </font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Geldon (1996) reported that transmissivity and apparent hydraulic-conductivity values determined using multiple-borehole hydraulic tests tend to be much higher&#8211;1 to 2 orders of magnitude&#8211;than values reported for single-borehole tests conducted at the same borehole.  For example, a single-borehole test at borehole UE-25c #3 resulted in a transmissivity value of 27.9 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d, but results of a multiple-borehole test for the same interval in the borehole indicated a transmissivity value of 1,860 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d.  Geldon (1996) concluded that multiple-borehole tests generally sample a much larger volume of the aquifer material and incorporate a larger number of water-bearing fractures than single-borehole tests.  Because most transmissivity and hydraulic-conductivity values at Yucca Mountain were obtained from single-borehole tests, the values listed in </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/8c122dd289d4fec2882566ad006d8fb0?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Tables 5.3-35</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> and </font><a href="/va/support/sitedesc/sec5.nsf/4558fc8942f67ec6882565bd007b1e21/ec15d0594a5b717b882566ad006d916b?OpenDocument"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3-36</font></a><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> may not be representative values appropriate for scales of tens to hundreds of meters (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, pp. 36-37).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The hydraulic characteristics of a particular interval at a borehole are highly dependent on the fracture characteristics of that interval.  A large conductive feature, such as the fault penetrated in the lower part of borehole UE-25c #1, can contribute a large percentage of the total flow to a borehole.  The tested interval containing such a feature can have a disproportionately large transmissivity and apparent hydraulic conductivity compared to other intervals in the same borehole.  Intervals that have a few conductive fractures generally contribute little water to the borehole and may have small transmissivity compared to other intervals in the borehole (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, p. 37).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Groundwater flow models have been used to estimate transmissivity over large areas.  Waddell (1982), in his groundwater flow model of the Death Valley flow system, had two zones that included the Yucca Mountain area.  Zone 1, which included the western and central part of the Yucca Mountain area, had an estimated transmissivity of about 700 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d, whereas Zone 8, which included the eastern part of the Yucca Mountain area, had an estimated transmissivity of about 7 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d.  The zones were quite large, and the model was not intended to be used to estimate transmissivity at Yucca Mountain, so these values need to be used with discretion.  Czarnecki and Waddell (1984) modeled the subbasin of the Death Valley flow system that includes Yucca Mountain.  Their Zone 10, which included the western part of Yucca Mountain, had an estimated transmissivity of about 80 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d, whereas Zone 6, which included the eastern part of Yucca Mountain, had an estimated transmissivity of more than 3,000 m</font><sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2</font></sup><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">/d.  Transmissivity estimates from field tests and simulations seem to be generally consistent, both in the order of magnitude of the values and the range in values.  However, the field tests and simulations have a large uncertainty associated with them (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, pp. 53-54).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Vertical hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy are parameters that need to be incorporated into 3-D flow models, but frequently are not simply because no data on them are available.  Tests to estimate vertical hydraulic conductivity were conducted only at borehole USW H-5 (Robison and Craig 1991, p. 26) and at the C-hole Complex (Geldon 1996).  Data from borehole USW H-5 should be used with discretion because it may not be representative of the area.  As was discussed in the &#8220;Moderate hydraulic gradient&#8221; section, USW H-5 has a potentiometric level consistent with boreholes west of the Solitario Canyon fault, even though the borehole is east of the fault.  Anisotropy was estimated only for borehole USW H-4 (Erikson and Waddell 1985, pp. 24-29).  These parameters are uncertain, both because of the few estimates available and because the estimates themselves are uncertain.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Storage properties of the saturated-zone flow system at Yucca Mountain are not discussed in great detail because so little data exist for storage properties.  Estimates for storage properties are uncertain even when aquifer tests are conducted with nearby observation holes; storage properties are particularly unreliable for single-hole tests, which is the usual type for Yucca Mountain.  Therefore, the storage properties discussed in this subsection are estimated or assumed only for a few boreholes in the Yucca Mountain area, and these estimates are quite different from borehole to borehole.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Storage properties are not required for steady-state simulations of groundwater flow, but they are required for time-dependent simulations.  The range of values for storativity for water table conditions (unconfined flow) may be large because effective porosity may be as small as 0.001 for fractured tuff and may exceed 0.20 for alluvium or nonwelded tuff.  For confined flow or deep unconfined flow within the saturated zone, the storativity could be an order of magnitude or more smaller (Luckey, Tucci et al. 1996, p. 53).</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Tests to determine effective (or flow) porosity and dispersivity, which are critical in transport simulations, also require multiple-well test sites.  In addition, they require data from long-term conservative tracer experiments.  As discussed in the preceding Subsection (5.3.3.2.2.2), tracer tests at the C-hole Complex provided effective-porosity estimates of .07 to 0.10, whereas a test in Drill Hole Wash provided an estimate of 0.0003.  Longitudinal dispersivities were estimated as 1.9 to 2.6 m at the C-hole Complex and 4.6 m at Drill Hole Wash.  A very tentative explanation might suggest that the larger effective porosity but smaller dispersivity at the C-hole Complex indicate more pervasive fracturing relative to a more dominant, fracture-controlled flowpath in Drill Hole Wash.  Whether this tentative characterization is reasonable and, particularly, whether these ranges of effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity are representative cannot be assessed on the basis of this small data set. </font>
