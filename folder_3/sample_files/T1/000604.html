                  <p>Counts 5-70 of the indictment charge each defendant indivi-dually with the use of a communication facility (a telephone) to facilitate a drug trafficking offense. </p>
                  <p>If convicted, the defendants&rsquo; sentences will be determined by the Court after review of factors unique to this case, including the defendants&rsquo; prior criminal record, if any, the defendants&rsquo; role in the offense and the unique characteristics of the violation.  In all cases, the sentences will not exceed the statutory maximum and in most cases they will be less than the maximum. </p>
                  <p>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph M. Pinjuh following a 12 month investigation code named &quot;Operation Latin Touch&quot;, which included three Title III wire taps in the Northern District of Ohio and one additional wire tap in Chicago, Illinois.  The investigation revealed that Patricia Cortes, aka Nora, and her associates would arrange for multiple kilograms of cocaine and marijuana to be brought to Chicago, Illinois, from Mexico.  Thereafter, Patricia Cortes, aka Nora, Glepsiela Caraballo, aka Gle, and their associates would transport kilogram quantities of the cocaine and marijuana to the greater Cleveland, Ohio area for re-distribution to Melvin Rojas, aka Ito, aka Bobby, and his associates.  Rojas would also purchase quantities of cocaine and marijuana locally from or with the assistance of Josue Vargas, Osvaldo Claudio, aka Valdi, Lazaro Correa, aka Cuba, Hector Nieves, aka Nicky, and others when Cortes was not available. Thereafter, Rojas and his associates would sell quantities of cocaine, crack cocaine and marijuana to various customers throughout the greater Cleveland, Ohio area.  Additionally, Rojas, Andres Ramirez, aka Junior, Osvaldo Claudio, aka Valdi, Joel Ramirez, aka Omar, Christian Santiago, aka Polo, Josue Vargas, Jose Reyes and Alex Torres, would supply one another and other members of the conspiracy with various types of firearms, which firearms were thereafter used to advance the goals of the drug distribution organization.  The conspirators also utilized drug and stash houses located throughout Cleveland, Ohio. </p>
                  <p>The investigation was conducted by agents and task force officers of the Caribbean Gang Task Force (CGTF).
