and Associated Funerary Objects from Gambell, AK, in the Control of the
Alaska State Office, Bureau of Land Management, Anchorage, AK

AGENCY: National Park Service

ACTION: Notice

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C.
3003 (d), of the completion of an inventory of human remains and
associated funerary objects in the control of the Alaska State Office,
Bureau of Land Management, Anchorage, AK. These human remains and
associated funerary objects are currently in the possession of the
University of Alaska Museum.
    A detailed assessment of the human remains and associated funerary
objects was made by Bureau of Land Management professional staff and
University of Alaska Museum professional staff in consultation with
representatives of the Native Village of Gambell.
    Between 1972-1973, human remains representing 53 individuals were
recovered by Hans-Georg Bandi during legally authorized excavations
near Sekloghyaget (or ``Old Gambell'') site, a nineteenth century
habitation section of Gambell, AK, the Troutman Lake site, a 19th
century grave site near Gambell, AK, and a 19th century habitation site
near modern Gambell, AK. No known individuals were identified. The 142
associated funerary objects include abraders, a blubber scraper,
buttons, foreshafts, ground slate tools, a ground slate point, faunal
remains, walrus tusks and tusk fragments, chert flakes, pottery sherds,
unworked stone, and a winged object.
    The three sites listed above have been identified as 19th century
habitation and cemetery areas at or near the Native Village of Gambell
through historical documentation, cultural items found at the sites,
and oral history.
    In 1939, human remains representing four individuals were recovered
by Louis Giddings at the Ayveghyaget site, a precontact habitation site
near Gambell, AK. No known individuals were identified. Between 1972-
1973, human remains representing three individuals were recovered by
Hans-Georg Bandi during legally authorized excavations from the
vicinity of the Ayveghyaget site. No known individuals were identified.
Three associated funerary objects recovered include ground slate,
worked ivory and faunal remains.
    In 1939, human remains representing three individuals were
recovered by Louis Giddings from the Kitngipalak site, a precontact
habitation site near Gambell, AK. No known individuals were identified.
Between 1972-1973, human remains representing 133 individuals were
recovered by Hans-Georg Bandi during legally unauthorized excavations
from the Kitngipalak site. No known individuals were identified. The
328 associated funerary objects include ground slate tools, chert
flakes, worked ivory, faunal remains, a whetstone, abraders and ulu
blades.
    In 1967, human remains representing 24 individuals were recovered
by Hans-Georg Bandi during legally authorized excavations from the
vicinity of the Ayveghyaget and Mayaghaaq sites, precontact habitation
sites near Gambell, AK. No known individuals were identified. The two
associated funerary objects are faunal remains.
    In 1968, human remains representing one individual were removed
from the Pagughileq site, a precontact habitation site on BLM land, and
donated to the University of Alaska Museum by a State of Alaska
employee in 1985. No known individual was identified. No associated
funerary objects are present.
    Between 1972-1973, human remains representing 36 individuals were
recovered by Hans-Georg Bandi during legally authorized excavations
from the vicinity of the Mayaghaaq site, a precontact habitation site
near Gambell, AK. No known individuals were identified. The 57
associated funerary objects include ivory harpoon heads, faunal
remains, ground slate fragments, ulu blades, and ivory fragments.
    Between 1972-1973, human remains representing seventeen individuals
were recovered by Hans-Georg Bandi during legally authorized
excavations from the Dovlaqhyaget site, a precontact habitation site
near Gambell, AK. No known individuals were identified. The 24
associated funerary objects include worked bone and ivory, faunal
remains, ground slate points and a winged object.
    In 1950, human remains representing eighteen individuals were
donated to the University of Alaska Museum by a private individual
after being illegally removed from BLM lands in the vicinity of
Gambell, AK. No known individuals were identified. No associated
funerary objects are present.
    In 1962, human remains representing two individuals were recovered
from BLM lands during legally authorized excavations in the vicinity of
Gambell, AK by Otto Geist. No known individuals were identified. No
associated funerary objects are present.
    The precontact sites and sites in the vicinity of Gambell, AK
listed above have been identified as occupied during the Okvik, Old
Bering Sea, and Punuk periods based on site organization, habitation
structures, cultural material, and Carbon0914 assays. The Carbon0914
assays and ethnohistorical data indicate these occupations represent a
continuity of cultural occupation of St. Lawrence Island from
approximately 300 AD to the historically documented epidemic and famine
of 1879 AD. The associated funerary objects from the ten sites located
at or near Gambell are

stylistically and functionally consistent with the Gambell cultural
development sequence. Additionally, the present-day Native residents of
Gambell are the documented descendants of the survivors of the 1879
epidemic and famine. Oral history evidence provided by representatives
of the Native Village of Gambell indicates on-going recognition of the
above Gambell grave sites as traditional burial grounds.
    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Bureau
of Land Management have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2
(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains
of 294 individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Bureau
of Land Management have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C.
3001 (3)(A), the 556 objects listed above are reasonably believed to
have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of
death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials
of the Bureau of Land Management have determined that, pursuant to 25
U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which
can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains
and associated funerary objects and the Native Village of Gambell.
    This notice has been sent to officials of the Native Village of
Gambell. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself
to be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated
funerary objects should contact Dr. Robert E. King, Alaska State NAGPRA
Coordinator, Bureau of Land Management, 222 W. 7th Avenue, 1B13,
Anchorage, AK 99513-7599; telephone: (907) 271-5510, before [thirty
days after publication in the Federal Register]. Repatriation of the
human remains and associated funerary objects to the Native Village of
Gambell may begin after that date if no additional claimants come
forward.
Dated: August 29, 1996.
