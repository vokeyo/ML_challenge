  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set consists of digital data describing wetland and upland
      habitats for the Brown Marsh area in 2000.  The data set includes 12
      7.5' quadrangles.  Wetlands were classified according to the Marsh
      Dieback Syndrome (MaDS) signature classification scheme. The
      classification was developed to delineate features of healthy and
      affected marsh and created through the use of field observations and
      laboratory analysis of the photography. The classification (key)
      references the defining vegetation and/or features and provides
      signature information (consistent photographic elements) for photo
      interpretation (located at http://www.brownmarsh.net).
    Purpose:
      The intended use of this data set is to map the extent of the marsh
      dieback for 2000 and to provide information for comparison to later
      habitat mapping efforts.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute accuracy was tested using several methods during the
      data development phases and completion. All interpreted photos were
      checked by two photo interpreters; all transfered based maps were
      checked by a cartographer and a photo interpreter, who didn't perform
      the original interpretations. Within in the interpretation phase,
      there were at least three stages of quality control. To further ensure
      the accuracy of the classification, ground truthing was conducted for
      both impacted and non-impacted areas. For areas of questionablity,
      similar non-impacted sites were visited to assist in supporting the
      classification. 1998 and 2000 aerial photography were used in the
      ground truthing activity. For digitizing phase, data are checked at
      least twice before finalization of maps. Data were tested by manual
      comparison of the source with hard copy printouts and/or symbolized
      display of the digital wetlands data on an interactive computer
      graphic system.  A check for adjacent polygons with the same attribute
      was conducted using an Arcview Avenue script. Overall, the attribute
      accuracy is believed high due to the multiple error-checking steps
      done redundantly during processing (for both the photo-interpretation
      and digitizing phases). Exact tolerances vary with coverages, as does
      the date of the processing and testing.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    This logical consistency report includes information about both general
    and specific topological tests and data generation dynamics in the
    fidelity of data.  Data is inherently polygonal.  Polygons intersecting
    the neatline are closed along the border.  Segments making up the outer
    and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the
    area.  Line segments are a set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs. 
    No duplicate features exist nor duplicate points in a data string. 
    Intersecting lines are separated into individual line segments at the
    points of intersection.  Point data are represented by two sets of
    coordinate pairs, each with the same coordinate values.  All nodes are
    represented by a single coordinate pair which indicates the beginning or
    end of a line segment.  The neatline for each quad is generated by
    connecting four corners of a digital file, as established during
    initialization of the digital file.  All data crossing the neatline are
    clipped to the neatline and data within a specified tolerance of the
    neatline are snapped to the neatline. During the photointerpretation
    stage, the large scale maps were edge matched to ensure line connection
    and attribute labeling.
  Completeness_Report:
    All photo-interpretable wetlands are identified and mapped using standard
    methodologies and equipment for the photo interpretation phases of the
    data development.  All wetlands were identified and mapped regardless of
    the size.  In general, the minimum mapping unit is .5 acres depending of
    the wetland type and the scale and emulsion of the source aerial
    photography. Processing of the digital data also follows conventions and
    standard methodologies for the time period and within limitations of
    available workstation equipment at the date of data development.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        For reference points accuracy, the accuracy for the digital data
        are tested by visual comparison of the source with hard copy maps,
        and by understanding of the hardware tolerances and processing
        values reported by the software used in data development. 
        Additional checks on comparison were possible when
        georeferencing/rectification was done using the USGS maps, which
        cite National Mapping Accuracy Standard compliance.

        Color infrared aerial photographs were photo interpreted for marsh
        habitat and upland habitat according to the MaDS classification.
        For questionable areas of barren and open water, the 1998 NAPP
        photography was used to ensure if the feature was dieback related.
        The interpreted photos were overlaid upon maps generated by the
        original photography.

      Entity_Type_Label: Marsh and Upland Habitat
      Entity_Type_Definition:
        Wetlands are saturated or inundated by water for an extended
        period of time during the growing season. For the photo
        interpretation process, the hydroregime results in hydric soil
        formation and hydrophytic plant species that present consistent
        aerial photographic signatures. For photointerpretation purposes,
        uplands are areas not periodically saturated or inundated,
        resulting in non-hydrophytic vegetation and soil signatures.

      Attribute_Definition:
        The alphanumerical designation for the wetlands and upland in the
        brown marsh dieback impacted and non-impacted area. The values may
        have associated modifiers attached. Modifiers include x
        (excavated), s (spoil), h (impounded), g (mangrove), o (oil), r,
        (wrack), and k (artificial). The designations were developed by an
        ad hoc committee comprised of marsh dieback scientists and
        researchers. All designations were developed through the use of
        field observations, expertise of scientific community, and
        examination of aerial photography. The signature key was developed
        specifically for the marsh dieback.

            Healthy emergent marsh is comprised of relatively dense
            vegetation dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina
            alterniflora). Other emergent marsh species that may be
            present, usually to a considerably lesser extent include
            salt grass (Distichlis spicata), needle rush (Juncus
            romerianus), and roseau cane (Phragmites australis).
            Herbaceous species may occur, but do not contribute
            significantly to the photographic signature. The emergent
            vegetation is usually 0.3 to 1.5 m tall. Signature feature
            - brilliant fuchsia with an even texture.

            Vegetation is less dense with some soil exposure.
            Signature feature - color is quite variable. The substrate
            color (faintly pale bluish to clear blue) is becoming
            increasingly evident through the pale pink to white
            vegetation. Texture is clumped white to pink inclusions on
