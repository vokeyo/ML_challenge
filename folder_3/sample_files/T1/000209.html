        <p>Salt marshes occur on all coasts of the United States around low-energy
        	areas such as estuaries, lagoons, bays and river mouths. They play
        	a vital role in the health of the coastal ecosystem. Salt marshes function
        	to help control floods, improve water quality, and contribute significantly
        	to coastal food webs. They provide valuable habitat for fish, birds,
        	and other wildlife. Over the past century, salt marshes have disappeared
        	at an alarming rate, primarily as a result of such activities as
        	dredging, filling, diking, and ditching. Natural salt marshes are a
        	function of their hydrology and must maintain a delicate balance between
        	salt water and fresh water.</p>

        <p>This project has two primary goals: 1) to restore
        	    full tidal hydrology to a series of diked and degraded estuarine wetlands;
        	    and (2) experimental correction for marsh surface subsidence by creating
       	    marsh <a href="#glossary" onMouseOver="return overlib(arGloss[3]);" onMouseOut="return nd();">mesocosms</a> at different tidal elevations (see <a href="../expert/research/research.htm">Restoration Research</a>).</p>
        <p><em>Innovative component: </em>In a portion of the project area where
        	  the marsh surface was too soft to accommodate dump trucks for removal
        	  of excavated material, explosives were used carefully and effectively
        	  to create a meandering tidal creek (Figure 2; video clip). In another
        	  area, an innovative method for removing a large amount of dike in one
        	  low tide window of opportunity was accomplished by digging vaults at
        	  various locations behind the dike to be removed. Filling the vaults
        	  with dike material as it was removed greatly speeded the time of dike
        	  removal by eliminating the need to truck dike material offsite.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the Black Bayou Hydrologic Restoration
        	    Project project is to restore coastal marsh habitat and slow the conversion
       	    of wetlands to shallow, open water.</p>
        <p><em>Innovative component: </em>A weir with a state-of-the-art, self-regulating
        	  tidegate (SRT) was installed to regulate the amount of saltwater intrusion
        	  into surrounding marsh habitat (Figure 3). In contrast to conventional
        	  tide gates that close when the tide rises, the SRT can be adjusted to
        	  allow tidal flow into the marsh behind it, closing only when a predetermined
        	  high water level is reached. This restores tidal flushing of the marsh
        	  while protecting upland property from flooding. Critical access for
        	  fisheries is maintained through fish slots on either side of the SRT.</p>

       	  Tampa Bay, Florida</p>
          <p>Tampa BayWatch facilitates the construction
        	    of salt marsh plant nurseries in the bay region's schools. With a 44 percent
        	    loss of shoreline vegetation in Tampa Bay over the past 100 years, the
        	    nurseries provide an inexpensive source of salt marsh plants for large-scale
        	    restoration projects in the Tampa Bay Estuary. The nurseries are monitored
        	    and maintained by students of all ages in coordination with school science
        	    teachers and science and ecology clubs. Smooth cordgrass plugs are harvested
        	    from a natural donor site and planted at the school nursery (Figure
        	    4). After six to eights months of growth, the students transplant the
       	    cordgrass at a restoration site.</p>
          <p><em>Innovative component: </em>It is estimated that the High School
        	  Wetland Nursery Program saves public agencies approximately $69,000
        	  per year in salt marsh plant purchase costs. This is the first program
        	  to use school systems to develop a permanent source of plants. Similar
       	    programs now exist in other areas such as Chesapeake Bay and Louisiana.</p>

        <h4>Mangrove Habitat</h4>
        <p>Mangrove ecosystems represent a crucial link between land and sea
        	in tropical and subtropical regions. Mangroves and their associated
        	waters provide valuable habitat and food for a wide range of fish, birds,
        	mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. They also stabilize sediments and
        	protect coastal uplands from flooding. Loss of mangrove from coastal
        	Florida, Louisiana, and Texas can be attributed in large part to urban
        	and industrial development in the coastal zone. </p>

         <p>The primary goal of the 11-acre project was
        	    to establish a typical Tampa Bay mangrove forest. Rather than immediately
        	    planting mangroves, as many mangrove restoration projects do, project
        	    planners first determined if the site had normal tidal hydrology and
        	    an available seed bank from adjacent mangrove stands. With these two
        	    factors present, mangrove habitat can self-repair within 15 to 30 years.
        	    At the Cross Bayou site, wetland elevation was restored and tidal creeks
        	    were constructed to allow for tidal flushing. Because a source of seeds
        	    was available from nearby stands, mangrove is recolonizing the site
        	    through natural processes, eliminating the need to plant (Figure 8).
        	    Two years of monitoring has shown that the success criterion for mangrove
       	    cover (30 percent) has been significantly exceeded.</p>

        <h4>Seagrass Habitat </h4>
        <p>Seagrass beds are an integral part of the estuarine and nearshore
        	environments. They provide food for a variety of important species as
        	well as providing a platform for growth of an assortment of algae and
        	small animals, indirectly providing a food source for many other organisms.
        	In addition, seagrass beds provide refuge for a wide variety of nearshore
        	fish and invertebrate species. They also help stabilize sediments and
        	protect coastlines from erosion. Seagrasses are susceptible to activities
        	that reduce light, such as construction projects that increase suspension
        	of silt and sand or shading from docks and other overwater structures.
        	Excessive nutrient inputs from sewage discharge or agriculture can lead
        	to dense accumulations of macroalgae (seaweeds), which can smother seagrass.
        	Acitivities such as dredging and boating can impact seagrass by disturbing
        	the sediment in which it grows. </p>

          </strong>South Florida</p>
        <p>In South Florida, fast-growing seagrasses are
        	    stimulated to grow in damaged seagrass beds by planting bundled bare
        	    root shoalgrass plants among bird roosting stakes. The stakes are constructed
        	    of 0.5-inch PVC poles fitted with a treated wood block on the top where
        	    cormorants and terns can roost (Figure 14). While roosting, the birds
        	    defecate into the water, providing a source of natural fertilization.
        	    Once the damaged area has been stabilized by shoalgrass, the stakes
        	    are removed to allow succession to turtlegrass, a slower growing <a href="#glossary" onMouseOver="return overlib(arGloss[5]);" onMouseOut="return nd();">climax

        <h4>Kelp Habitat</h4>
        <p>Kelp forests occur in cold, nutrient-rich waters and are among the
        	most biologically productive habitats in the marine environment. Giant
        	kelp and bull kelp are the key species in the kelp forests that stretch
        	from Alaska to California on the west coast. These &quot;rainforests of the
        	sea&quot; are critical to sustaining commercial and recreational fisheries.
        	An increase in sedimentation from urban runoff and toxins from sewage
        	discharge has degraded kelp habitat. Overfishing and hunting of many
        	of the natural predators of sea urchins has seemingly led to an increase
        	in many area sea urchin populations. Sea urchins are voracious consumers
        	of kelp. </p>

        	  is anticipated that the oyster communities will improve water quality,

          Lake Erie, Ohio</p>
          <p>Historical and geospatial data guided the restoration
        	  of Metzger Marsh, a coastal wetland in western Lake Erie. The marsh,
        	  a 300-hectare wetland in an embayment, once formed the mouth of a creek
        	  that was channelized directly to the lake in the late 1800s. Also,
        	  a barrier beach that protected the wetland from Lake Erie waves was
        	  ultimately destroyed in 1973 by a combination of extremely high water
        	  levels, storm events, and reduced sediment supply. This resulted in
        	  a significant loss of wetland vegetation. Large-scale aerial photographs
        	  were interpreted to delineate major vegetation types as well as the
        	  historical boundaries of the barrier beach. A geographic information
        	  system (GIS) was then used to digitize the data and calculate areas
        	  of vegetation and barrier beach. Paleoecological studies were also employed
        	  to identify historical vegetation species. Based on these studies, the
        	  restoration program was designed to return the embayment to a fully
        	  functional, vegetated coastal marsh with hydrologic connection to the
        	  lake, similar to the original wetland (Figure 19). A dike was constructed
        	  to mimic the functions of the barrier beach and included a water-control
        	  structure to allow hydrologic connection to the lake. The water-control
        	  structure contains five 2-m wide channels that can be manipulated individually.
        	  It also contains an experimental fish-control system that restricts
        	  passage of large carp while allowing other fish to pass through. Each
        	  passageway contains fish baskets that can be lifted out to capture,
       	    count, and measure fish.</p>

        	along a shoreline when water is pushed up by winds. Once the wind is
        	reduced, the water mass continues to oscillate, much like the water
        	in a bathtub that sloshes back and forth.<br /><a href="#top"><span class="style5">&gt; Return to top</span></a></p>
