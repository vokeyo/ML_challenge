\par \tab \tab I'd like to welcome all of the members of the panel and I appreciate their being willing to participate today.
\par \tab \tab At this point I'd like to turn the discussion over to Ms. Freddie Poole, who is the executive secretary.
\par \tab \tab MS. POOLE:  Good morning.  I'd like to read the conflict of interest statement.
\par \tab \tab The following announcement addresses conflict of interest issues associated with this meeting and is made a part of the record to preclude even the appearance of impropriety.
\par \tab \tab To determine if any conflict existed, the agency reviewed the submitted agenda for this meeting and all financial interests reported by the committee participants.  The conflict of interest statute prohibits special government employees from participating in matters that could affect their or their employees' financial interests.
\par \tab \tab However, the agency has determined that the participation of certain members and consultants, the need for whose services outweighs the potential conflict of interest involved, is in the best interest of the government.
\par \tab \tab Therefore, a waiver under 18 USC 208(b)(3) has been granted to Dr. Juan Felix for his unrelated consulting agreement with a firm that has a financial interest in the sponsor.  He receives less than 10,000 a year.  The waiver allows this participant to participate fully in today's deliberations.
\par \tab \tab Copies of this waiver may be obtained by submitting a written request to the agency's Freedom of Information Office, Room 12A15 of the Parklawn Building.
\par \tab \tab We would like to note for the record that the agency took into consideration certain matters regarding another panelist, Dr. George Birdsong.  He reported current interests with firms at issue, but in matters that are not related to today's agenda, the Agency has determined, therefore, that he may participate fully in the panel's deliberation.
\par \tab \tab We would like to note that Dr. Elizabeth Unger, who is a guest discussant at this meeting has reported her employer's unrelated involvement with a firm at issue.
\par \tab \tab In the event that the discussions involve any other products or firms not already on the agenda for which an FDA participant has a financial interest, the participant should excuse him or herself from such involvement and the exclusion will be noted for the record.
\par \tab \tab With respect to all other participants, we ask that in the interest of fairness all persons making statements, all presentations disclose nay current or previous financial involvement with any firm whose products they may wish to comment upon.
\par \tab \tab We would also ask as a part of housekeeping that anyone with cell phones or pagers, if you could either turn them off or set them on a silent mode just as a common courtesy for the speakers.
\par \tab \tab Thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Our new business for today is a premarket approval supplement for the Digene high risk HPV DNA.  This is a nucleic acid hybridization }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 in vitro}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  diagnostic device for the detection of 13 high risk types of human papillomavirus in cervical specimens.  The test as modified is indicated for use as a general population screening test in conjunction with the Pap smear for women 30 years of age and older as an aid to determine the absence of high grade cervical disease or cancer.
\par \tab \tab We're going to begin with the manufacturer's presentation.  Just as a note to everyone, FDA has asked that we do finish on time today because of the number of persons who have travel arrangements in the late afternoon.  So we will be sticking to the schedule.
\par \tab \tab In the initial presentation for the manufacturer, there are a larger number of persons who are presenting.  We will be ending that presentation at 10:15.  So out of courtesy to the other persons who are speaking on behalf of the manufacturer, please keep in mind that whoever is up at 10:15 will be stopped and we'll be moving on to the next part of the program, and we'll do that throughout the day because we just cannot afford to get behind schedule today.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to ask the panel members to hold all of their questions until after all nine presentations are completed, and I'd like to remind the audience that only members of the panel can ask questions of the speakers.
\par \tab \tab So at this point we'd like to have the manufacturer begin their presentation.  I believe Mr. Charles Fleischmann is going to begin.
\par \tab \tab MR. FLEISCHMANN:  One clerical note to begin.  I know you have the packet of slides.  We have reordered the slides.  There's not new material.  Ms. Poole has a copy of those slides, and we just wanted to make you aware of it, and if we can facilitate your understanding or following of the program, that would be fine.
\par \tab \tab Good morning.  I'm  Chuck Fleischmann, President of Digene Corporation.
\par \tab \tab Regulatory and Clinical Affairs has been one of several major areas for which I have been responsible at Digene for the last 12 years.
\par \tab \tab In addition, I sit on the board of directors of ADVAMED, Medical Device and Diagnostic Trade Association.  I chair the ADVAMED board subcommittee on FDA regulation of }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 in vitro}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  diagnostics, and frequently represent the diagnostic industry in discussions with senior FDA and NIH officials.
\par \tab \tab From that, we have tried to make full understanding of the highest standards for clinical and regulatory requirements part of the fabric of our work at Digene.  In the last dozen years, Digene has worked with the pioneers in the field of cervical cancer, diagnostics and prevention, particularly surrounding the unique causal association of human papillomavirus to the cancer.
\par \tab \tab We have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of our device as a follow-up screen for women with ASCUS PAPs and for use to help rule out high grade disease following an abnormal PAP.
\par \tab \tab The device is now approved by FDA for those indications.  In the next 75 minutes, you will hear presentations from scientific, regulatory, statistical, clinical, and legal professionals with literally 200 years of experience in molecular diagnostics in women's health.  
\par \tab \tab We believe we can show you that our hybrid catcher (phonetic) HPV test, when combined with the PAP as a primary screen for women age 30 and older, is better clinical medicine than just PAP alone.
\par \tab \tab We are honored to show the weight of studies from around the world that show the same thing.  Without regard to geography or ethnicity, Digene's HPV test is better at detecting current underlying high grade disease than PAP alone.  The combination provides exquisite sensitivity and extraordinary negative predictive value and, therefore, makes it possible to better characterize women at increased or lowered risk of having high grade cervical disease.
\par \tab \tab We are asking you to review the data and recommend approval of the combination, not HPV testing alone; HPV plus PAP for women age 30 and older, a very specific and conservative indication.
\par \tab \tab This combination takes women's health one step closer to our goal that no woman should ever die of cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab Today's presentation will establish that HPV causes cervical cancer.  The data in the PMA supplement show HPV testing and cancer's PAP testing.  The combination of cytology with HPV testing is important for women's health and public health in general, and that HPV testing can be safely and effectively incorporated into current clinical practice.
\par \tab \tab Please ask any questions you have and thank you in advance for your consideration of our PMA supplement for expanded product labeling.
\par \tab \tab I will now turn the microphone over to Mark Del Vecchio, Digene's Director of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs.
\par \tab \tab MR. DEL VECCHIO:  Thank you, Mr. Fleischmann.
\par \tab \tab Good morning.  I'd like to briefly introduce the speakers Digene has assembled for this morning's discussion and provide an overview of the major discussion points.
\par \tab \tab Digene has assembled a distinguished group of individuals to provide you with an understanding of the PMA supplement under consideration, including  renowned HPV expert, Dr. Atilla Lorincz, and epidemiologist, Dr. Xavier Bosch, who will discuss the causal link between HPV and cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab Our statistical team, as you can see, is comprised of Joe Canner, who performed the primary data analysis, and Drs. Chiaccierini and Schoenfeld, who provide statistical support.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Chiaccierini, former head of biostatistics at CDRH, and Dr. Schoenfeld, professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard School of Public Health, will not be presenting, but are available to answer any of your questions.
\par \tab \tab Contributing to the discussion are three practicing clinicians and GYN oncologists, Drs. Cox, Kinney, and Killackey.  They will provide a clinician's perspective of the clinical utility of the test, use of HPV and PAP for managing women's health.
\par \tab \tab As part of this discussion, an algorithm describing how HPV fits into the current cervical cancer screening program will be described.  The information they are presenting this morning will focus on the technical and practical aspects of HPV testing and the scientific evidence that supports its use as a general population screening test specifically in conjunction with the PAP for women age 30 and older, as Mr. Fleischmann had indicated.
\par \tab \tab In this effort, we will provide a balanced and reasonable analysis of the underlying clinical data.
\par \tab \tab As you can see, we have been working very closely with DCLD over the past two years, and this effort has resulted in submission of a PMA supplement under consideration this morning.
\par \tab \tab Digene is seeking to expand its current and preapproved indication for high risk HPV tests.  Broadly defined, this test is currently approved for use in qualitative detection of HPV DNA cervical specimens, the two main intended uses are for ASCUS screening, for colposcopy referral, and management of women with low and high grade disease.
\par \tab \tab The proposed intended use expands these claims to include HPV for general population screening with a PAP for women 30 and older.  This will permit use of HPV for women with normal PAP, for the further identification of those at low risk, HPV negative women, and increased risk, HPV positive women for underlying high grade disease for cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab This is possible due to the increased negative predictive value, the sensitivity of the HPV test when used as an adjunct to PAP.
\par \tab \tab Now, I would like to introduce Dr. Xavier Bosch, who will discuss the causal relationship between HPV and cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab DR. BOSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
\par \tab \tab Good morning to everyone.  My name is Xavier Bosch.  I'm a cancer epidemiologist.  I work at the International Agency for Research in Cancer for over ten years, and I've been working in the HPV and cervical cancer field for about 20 years.
\par \tab \tab I do not have any vested interest in the company.  I sit in their advisory group in Europe, and my institute, which is a public health institute, has a research agreement with Digene.
\par \tab \tab The discussion that I'm presenting today is on causality, which is still extremely relevant because it sets the ground for any clinical uses that one claims for HPV testing.
\par \tab \tab I prepared for you a working document that is in your folders, and now it's in the final stages for publication.  It has been reviewed and acknowledge by over 28 distinguished scientists worldwide.
\par \tab \tab The review follows the established criteria of causality that have been used since the late '50s in assessing the nature of the association observed between exposure and human cancer, and the evaluation for the association between HPV and cervical cancer shows that the compliance with the major criteria in the majority of the instances.
\par \tab \tab Follow-up studies that have observed the transition from normal cytology to high grade lesions have clearly documented that infection precedes the advent of disease, and that the disease rate is substantially affected by the HPV status of the woman at recruitment.
\par \tab \tab Case control studies have consistently shown extremely high ratios for what is known in human cancer.  It is extremely consistent geographically.  It is consistent when you break it down by histological types, if you test once or twice or if you test for HPV as a group or if you test for high risk HPV types alone.
\par \tab \tab Molecular studies have also shown that the transition from normal cell to invasive cancer is strongly influenced by the presences of the vital DNA.  In fact, the oncogenic proteins of HPV labeled E6 and E7 are capable of interfering with essential regulatory genes for cell type and DNA repair, and that effectively rules away the alternative hypothesis that HPV might be just a passenger super infection of the neoplastic tissue.
\par \tab \tab If one had to summarize what is the current thinking on the etiology of cervical cancer using the factors that have been established for HPV positive women and using optimal HPV testing, we've done that in some 2,300 cases worldwide.  And one can see that perhaps one quarter of them we have HPV alone as the risk factor.  Three quarters of them might have HPV plus something else, and only a tiny fraction, in this case less than 400,000, would be linked to a model that did not include HPV in that scheme.
\par \tab \tab And based on the results, the claim has been made that HPV is, in fact, a necessary cause of cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab So against a background of publications that show the explosive nature of the field, one can say that in 1992 and 1995 there were international review boards certifying HPV certifying HPV 16 and 19 as human carcinogens, Class I, and after that time there's very little in the literature that even claims that the central hypothesis of causality has any alternative.
\par \tab \tab So in conclusion, we can say that HPV is, indeed, causally related to cervical cancer; that the DNA of the virus can be recovered from virtually all cases of cervical cancer worldwide; and that there is a scientific consensus that HPV is, indeed, a necessary but not sufficient cause of cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab In more practical terms, that implies that the absence of HPV means low risk for disease and the presence of the vital DNA means an increased risk.
\par \tab \tab And I thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  My name is Walter Kinney.  I'm a gynecologic oncologist.  I practice in Sacramento, California, with the Permanente Medical Group.
\par \tab \tab My financial associations and those of Permanente with the Digene Corporation are that ending approximately five years ago, they provided us with supplies and laboratory support to conduct a study of ASCUS triage.  Since that time a portion of the public speaking that I do about cervical cancer screening has been supported by Digene.
\par \tab \tab I want to speak to you this morning about the clinical utility of combining cervical cytology and HPV testing, and I want to start with some opinions formed in 15 years of clinical practice.
\par \tab \tab The choice of endpoints about trial design is an important one.  Invasive cancer is not an option as an endpoint for a clinical trial performed in the United States.  Our IRB would not tolerate this, and no patient would sign the consent after it had been written by our legal staff.
\par \tab \tab CIN2 and above is a clinically relevant endpoint because this is the point at which surgical procedures eventuate from a histologic diagnosis of this type.
\par \tab \tab One of the requirements of our IRB is the potential benefit to trial participants.  Colposcopy and biopsy of all or a substantial portion of women with negative cytology and negative HPV high risk testing is not viable at the IRB level or at the level of patient consent, and this opinion of mine is informed by having spent some years consenting people for the ASCUS study that I mentioned wherein colposcopy and biopsy was the single biggest stumbling block in terms of women's willingness to participate.
\par \tab \tab The potential clinical utility of high risk HPV testing with cytology is in patients with negative cytology, which is most of the PAP smears that we do.  For those patients who have negative HPV tests, there's a measure of reassurance associated with the knowledge that they don't pair to this virus.
\par \tab \tab And for those patients with positive HPV tests that are potential benefits with problems that we have about compliance and about deciding on time to follow up within the established standards of practice.
\par \tab \tab And finally, we have a couple of years of experience with providing hybrid capture II testing to our physicians for ASCUS triage, and that occurs in a way such that the physicians are not penalized if they don't adopt this.  They have other options within the guidelines, and there is nothing bad happens to them if they don't use this.
\par \tab \tab But the widespread adoption of the testing in the last couple of years has demonstrated to our satisfaction the clinical value of the test outweighs the perceived negatives of having to educate the patients about the meaning of positivity.
\par \tab \tab Let's move on from opinion to what it is we know.  We know from examining our own failures that the screening system that produces cervical cancer in some patients despite easy access to care has two central problems, one of which is failure to convince people to be screened in a timely fashion despite access to care, and the other one is that for approximately  30 percent of our patients, that single screen with a dry slide in a three year period prior to their diagnosis was not sufficient to prevent them from developing cancer.
\par \tab \tab I would also point out that 95 percent of our invasive cancer cases occur in people who are above 30 years of age.  So this is the relevant target population.
\par \tab \tab We've made an effort to figure out the best way to reach out to people who haven't been screened in a timely fashion, and we did this large, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial with our own money, and the information that we provide to patients by mail  and by the telephone to convince them to come in has simply not been adequate up to this point.
\par \tab \tab Motivating people to comply even in the absence of financial disincentives has been something that neither we nor anyone else have figured out how to do, and there are eight more randomized controlled trials at this point.  This is basically the same thing.
\par \tab \tab Additional information that we could provide to patients might conceivably be helpful in this arena.  Certainly we don't do a very good job at this point.
\par \tab \tab In 1986, a study was published from the International Agency for Research on cancer pooling, ten sites outside of the United States, to assess cervical cancer screening intervals.  They defined a one year interval as zero to 11 months; two years as 12 to 23 months, and so on; and demonstrated that the protection from cancer as opposed to no screening was very similar at one, two, and three year intervals.
\par \tab \tab This study cast a very wide shadow in terms of public health policy and led experts to conclude that for most women a three year screening frequency was appropriate.
\par \tab \tab Those conclusions were reflected and are reflected in the recommendations of a substantial number of organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the American College of Physicians, and so on.
\par \tab \tab And these recommendations are grounded in the notion that not everybody needs to be screened at annual intervals because there are low and high risk women.  The problem is that that risk stratification has been based up to this point on either historical factors which don't work well or on the number of previous negative smears that a woman has had.
\par \tab \tab The clinical consequences of telling a woman to come back in a year or two years or three years produce a distribution of intervals to return for PAP similar to what you see here, and I've superimposed on this experience of ours the interval definitions that the International Agency for Research on Cancer used in their publication.
\par \tab \tab If you tell a patient to come back in a year, they don't all come back by 11 months.  As a matter of fact, the majority of them don't come back by 11 months.  This compromises the interpretation of those results.
\par \tab \tab And when we examined this ourselves, we felt that this was a big enough problem that we invested a large amount of institutional money in looking at this on our own with sample size in the three cells, one, two and three years, about two and a half times what was available from the pooled ten site analysis that the IARC did and with what we consider to be clinically relevant intervals.
\par \tab \tab And the results are that within the accepted screening intervals of one to three years, there is a meaningful stratification of risk, and by three years the risk doubles as opposed to a one year interval, and that that change is not affected by whether you've ever had an abnormal PAP smear or whether you've had two consecutive negative PAPs prior to the diagnosis of your cancer.
\par \tab \tab My conclusion is that the additional information that high risk HPV testing as to cytology is useful to clinicians and patients in multiple ways, and in the setting where screening intervals of more than a year are routinely recommended, the presence of the high risk HPV in women over the age of 30 identifies a group who may benefit from annual cytologic screening.
\par \tab \tab Thanks for your attention.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Mr. Chairman, members of the panel, Food and Drug Administration, members of the audience, good morning.  I am Atilla Lorincz, Chief Scientific Officer and Senior Vice President of Digene Corporation.
\par \tab \tab I've personally conducted research in the HPV field for the past 17 years, the last ten years of which were at Digene Corporation, and I'm the author or co-author of over 100 peer review publications in the field.
\par \tab \tab This morning I'm going to describe clinical study data that Digene is submitting to the agency in support of our request for a labeling claim allowing adjunctive use of HPV testing with the Papanicolaou test in women over the age of 30 years.
\par \tab \tab We reviewed the literature and selected all relevant and applicable studies.  In addition, several of the studies were designed by Digene in conjunction with the investigators with the intent of validating the use of Digene's hybrid capture II HPV test as a screening adjunct to the PAP test.
\par \tab \tab Digene determined the minimum consistent requirements for studies to include in our detailed analyses, and we selected eight studies that met our criteria.
\par \tab \tab With these data, we wish to demonstrate the safety and the effectiveness of the hybrid capture test as a general population screen for cervical disease for women 30 and over in conjunction with the PAP.
\par \tab \tab I would like to note that there were not studies that met our criteria that were excluded.  Some of the key requirements that the studies had to meet were compliance with Helsinki requirements for protection of human subjects.  Also these had to use the hybrid capture HPV test, and line data had to be available for independent analyses, which we conducted in consultation with our statisticians. 
\par \tab \tab These reanalyzed data are the basis of this presentation.  Note our conclusion do not differ materially from those of the principal investigators of these studies, several of which have been published.
\par \tab \tab The size of seven of the eight studies were statistically meaningful.
\par \tab \tab This is a list of the eight studies that we selected, along with the names of the principal investigators and the academic or governmental institutions involved.  As you can see from this list, there was a substantial number of women enrolled in these studies, overall totaling more than 44,000, 11,000 of which, or about 25 percent, were from the USA, with the vast majority coming from the Portland study, which we regard as one of the key studies of this presentation.
\par \tab \tab Studies represent a diversity of country sites and ethnic compositions worldwide.  It is our position that these patients are reflective of the diverse ethnic groups resident in the U.S.
\par \tab \tab All studies were conducted under a rigorous pre-written and approved protocols, and endpoints were carefully determined by expert readers of cytology and histology.  Importantly, in most studies the histology specimens were reviewed by an expert pathologist or an expert panel to determine as accurately as possible the true end condition.
\par \tab \tab Several of the studies have been published in the peer reviewed literature, as I mentioned, and the credentials of the principal investigators are of the highest order, as are the scientific reputations of the host institutions.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to emphasize that despite variability of certain protocol parameters, HPV testing was consistent across studies and the major conclusions are concordant.
\par \tab \tab Let's review some of the characteristics of these studies in terms of some of the key parameters.  Six of the eight studies -- I beg your pardon -- seven out of the eight studies had sufficient statistical power, and the study from Hopkins, Baltimore, was included at the request of the FDA.
\par \tab \tab The majority of studies used the Bethesda system, and in those -- I beg your pardon.
\par \tab \tab The majority of the studies used the Bethesda system and histological confirmation was conducted in all of the studies.  Of importance, masking in the studies was present in every case.
\par \tab \tab This is the description of the target condition, histologically confirmed high grade disease.  Dr. Kinney has already described the conditions on the cervix that necessitate treatment.  We used a primary endpoint of CIN2+ as a definition of high grade disease.  In other words, CIN2, CIN3 are invasive cancer.
\par \tab \tab Additionally, at the request of the FDA, we reanalyzed the data with a CIN3+ endpoint.  That is excluding the CIN2 category.
\par \tab \tab Next slide.
\par \tab \tab With respect to specimen collection materials, for the most part the specimen collection materials used the approved device.  Some studies, one study in particular, the Portland study, used cervicovaginal lavage and some other studies used a combination of Cytobrush with or without a spatula.
\par \tab \tab Despite different collection methods, we observed consistent results.  I would like to emphasize that in the Portland study even with the use of cervicovaginal lavage, which biased against the HPV test, we observed a big improvement over PAP alone after adding the HPV test to the PAP smear.
\par \tab \tab We're going to focus first on the Kaiser study, which is a large U.S. screening trial of over 10,000 women age 30 and older that were cytologically normal at baseline.  The study had multi-year follow-up, and the data we present today is based on evaluation at three years.  This study alone supports the proposed claim that we have before you today.
\par \tab \tab Justification for the three year determination is under the following assumptions.  We assume that disease detected by repeat PAP smear screening at three years indicates a very high probability that disease was present at the outset because high grade lesions do not regress, and therefore, we felt it was appropriate to use as a method of verification repeat PAP smear data on this group of women conducted over a three year period.
\par \tab \tab Some considerations related to use of the cervicovaginal lavage specimens are shown here.  There are a number of limitations of this material, such as, for example, it will collect a large amount of nonspecific cellular material from the vaginal tract, not necessarily from the cervix, and thus provides a less localized specimen which in certain instances may not detect a small, high grade lesion inside the os.
\par \tab \tab Adjunctive HPV testing using CVL nevertheless identify the significantly greater number of women with high grade cervical disease compared to PAP alone.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to mention that some studies, one in particular by Hall, }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 et al}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 ., compared CVL to brush and did find a slightly lower sensitivity that was observed for the CVL.
\par \tab \tab Next slide, please.
\par \tab \tab Well, this talks about the applicability of foreign studies to the U.S. population.  The PAP was read by expert pathologists in  three studies, and the PAP methods and the Bethesda system was used in six of the studies.
\par \tab \tab The resident improvement in sensitivity of the HPV test over the PAP is applicable to the U.S. over a spectrum of disease prevalence.
\par \tab \tab These PMAs represent independent prospective analyses.  Six of these had sufficient statistical power to stand on their own as a disease endpoint, and the seventh study, which was conducted in China, showed no evidence of verification bias.  I'd like to emphasize that such a study could not be done in the U.S. for the reasons mentioned by Dr. Walter Kinney with respect to IRB concerns or compliance of the patients.
\par \tab \tab Nevertheless, in China all of the women were biopsied, and apparently there was minimal or no verification bias detected due to no disease being found in the PAP-HPV negative women.
\par \tab \tab And the eighth study provided additional support in U.S. data.
\par \tab \tab Next slide, please.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to just go into the data here, and we're going to use the CIN3 as our principal endpoint for these particular set of tables.  I'd like to mention the Portland study which had a CIN3+ endpoint.  CIN2 was not done in Portland as an endpoint.
\par \tab \tab We look at the numbers of patients here, and we looked at the prevalence of CIN3.  It varied from a low in Baltimore, Johns Hopkins' study, or Germany of about .2 to .4 percent up to as high as four percent in South Africa.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to emphasize that the prevalence of disease in the U.S. in the Portland study and in the Johns Hopkins study was at the lower end consistent with other international studies, such as from U.K. and Germany.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to spend a little bit of time on this particular graph showing the sensitivity of the HPV test combined with PAP, compared to PAP alone.  When we look at these studies, we see a dramatic improvement in the sensitivity of the HPV combination with PAP relative to the original PAP test alone.
\par \tab \tab For example, in the Portland study going from 50 to 80 percent.  The same thing was observed in several of the other studies.
\par \tab \tab Of note, in those studies where the PAP smear had a relatively low sensitivity, 50 to 60 percent, such as in Germany, Mexico, Portland, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins study, the addition of the HPV test led to an important and dramatic increase in the sensitivity of the combined tests, and this increase was far greater than would have been expected by chance alone.  So we feel that that shows a very important improvement in the combination of the test.
\par \tab \tab And this chart here demonstrates the statistical analyses of the confidence intervals around those estimates.  In six out of the eight studies here we met or exceeded the criteria that was agreed to in discussions with the FDA.  As we can see in several of the studies, the mean value of the sensitivity improvement was 100 percent.
\par \tab \tab In two of the studies the lower end of the bound of the 95 percent confidence interval due to power issues was below the 25 percent level, but in six of them it was significantly above that level.
\par \tab \tab Next slide.
\par \tab \tab Looking at the specificity of the combinations, either PAP alone or PAP plus HPV combined for CIN3, we see a small decrease in specificity of the combined test relative to PAP alone sa would be expected by adding the two tests like this.
\par \tab \tab We believe that the data demonstrate that the decrease in specificity is minor.  As shown here, assessing the decrease in specificity of the combined tests relative to the predetermined cutoff that had been agreed to, which is a specificity decrease of less than or equal to ten percent was acceptable.  Seven of the eight studies met those criteria, and only one, South Africa, did not meet those particular set of criteria.
\par \tab \tab Next slide.
\par \tab \tab Looking at the negative predictive value, I'd like to emphasize that we have expanded the range on the Y axis.  It's 99 to 100 percent.  This is by way of emphasis of the differences in negative predictive values since negative predictive values in rare diseases tend to not differ very much, but those differences are extremely important.
\par \tab \tab We can see that in all studies, again, as observed with the sensitivity, the combined negative predictive value of a HPV adjunct to the PAP was higher than the PAP alone.
\par \tab \tab Next slide. 
\par \tab \tab Looking at the positive predictive values, despite the variations in prevalence in different parts of the world, despite the different ethnic composition of the studies, we see that the positive predictive values of the PAP alone or PAP plus HPV were very similar in the majority of these studies beyond the order of perhaps eight to 20 percent, in that range for either PAP or HPV plus PAP.
\par \tab \tab Now, I'd like to focus on the main endpoint that Digene has presented, which is the CIN2+ endpoint, including this neoplastic category that is slightly lower, CIN2, combined with CIN2-3.  The value of these data are that there are greater numbers of women with CIN2+, the combined prevalence of all of these conditions now being on the order of half percent to up as high as six percent.
\par \tab \tab As I mentioned before, the Portland data are missing from here because they only had a CIN3+ endpoint, and in keeping with our conclusions from the CIN3 endpoint, the sensitivity of the HPV combination with PAP was always higher than the sensitivity of PAP alone, substantially higher in most studies, and the specificity decrease was quite small.
\par \tab \tab I would like to show two slides. 
\par \tab \tab Next slide.
\par \tab \tab This shows the assessment of the sensitivity improvement of PAP and the combination of PAP plus HPV against the 24 percent relative sensitivity improvement.  Seven of the eight studies met those criteria.  The Johns Hopkins study actually had a mean value of 100 percent, but because of its small size, the lower bound did not cross the 25 percent threshold.
\par \tab \tab Looking at the specificity decrease relative to PAP, seven of the eight studies met or exceeded by quite a substantial amount the criteria.  The South African study did not meet the criteria, this particular case with the 95 percent being below ten percent.
\par \tab \tab Next slide.
\par \tab \tab So some of the potential limitations of the studies are Portland used the CVL, which is not a currently approved device for HPV.  Some other studies used either plastic spatula and Cytobrush or Cytobrush alone.
\par \tab \tab I've already alluded to the fact that we believe that cervicovaginal lavage is sufficient for HPV detection, and although it biases against detection of high grade disease, it still yielded important adjunct of sensitivity.
\par \tab \tab The Cytobrush spatula -- sorry to jump ahead -- the Cytobrush spatula combination is approved for the PAP.  In our preliminary studies, we demonstrate -- we have demonstrated equivalence for HPV DNA detection, and this data has not yet been submitted to the agency, but it's in preparation to show.
\par \tab \tab And this particular study looks at the brush spatula versus CVL.  This table is actually from the study of Hall, }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 et al}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .  If you'll remember back a few slides, it demonstrates clearly that for detection of high grade disease, HPV positivity by brush was improved relative to CVL and for low grade disease brush appear to be somewhat better, whereas for detection of HPV in PAP negative women there did not appear to be that much of a difference.
\par \tab \tab So we believe that these data demonstrate that the brush is an improved device relative to CVL.
\par \tab \tab In the conclusions for all of these presentations then, I'd like to emphasize a number of important points.  These eight studies represent multiple independent sites and multiple independent studies done at different institutions by different investigators comprising 44,000 women, over 44,000 women with 25 percent coming from the U.S.
\par \tab \tab There is a broad ethnic representation, and these ethnic groups are currently resident in the U.S.
\par \tab \tab A broad range of prevalence.  Our data, I believe, show that irrespective of the range of prevalence observed, the performance of the test certainly did not change.  Sensitivity was not affected or would not expect to be affected based upon statistical considerations.
\par \tab \tab Most of these were designed to maximize the sensitivity of the PAP smear.  By that I mean that expert panels or expert cytopathologists spend considerable time insuring that the PAP smear was performed to the highest level.
\par \tab \tab This did not happen in all studies, but it did happen in most, and because the PAP is a test that is subject to expert review, it is our position that the performance of PAP smear alone in these studies is, for the most part, considerably better than would be found in a routine screening setting.
\par \tab \tab That conclusion is not the same for a test such as HPV, which uses an objective endpoint that is generated by a machine and a computer analytical algorithm.
\par \tab \tab Seven of the eight -- despite the variability of certain protocol parameters, HPV was consistent across the studies, and the major conclusions were  concordant.  Seven of the eight studies were statistically significant.
\par \tab \tab And finally, in conclusion, in all studies HPV is an adjunct of the PAP, is a more sensitive indicator for cervical disease than PAP alone, with only a minor reduction in specificity of the combined tests.
\par \tab \tab Thank you very much for your attention.
\par \tab \tab MR. CANNER:  Good morning.  My name is Joseph Canner, biostatistician and regulatory consultant at Hogan & Hartson in Washington, D.C.
\par \tab \tab I have no financial interest in Digene.  I'm being paid by Digene for my time and transportation costs.
\par \tab \tab I was primarily responsible for the statistical analysis of the data from the eight studies that Dr. Lorincz described, and I am joined here, as was mentioned earlier, by Dr. Richard Chiaccierini from C.O. McIntosh and Dr. David Schoenfeld in the Harvard School of Public Health behind me.
\par \tab \tab During the time period that Digene was identifying and obtaining data sets from the various investigators, we were also preparing a prospective statistical analysis plan.  This plan was developed prior to any data analysis and was discussed with FDA on several occasions.
\par \tab \tab Now, before we get into the specifics of the analysis plan, there are two important points to note, some of which I mentioned earlier.
\par \tab \tab Since each study was conducted independently under a different protocol, the decision was made to analyze these studies separately.  Six of these studies had sufficient sample size for the outcomes of interest, and so we felt comfortable with this approach
\par \tab \tab The two smallest studies were included for confirmative purposes, China because of a complete biopsy verification and Baltimore because it is a U.S. population conducted by a reputable institution, namely, Johns Hopkins.
\par \tab \tab Second, the success criteria for each study were developed based on two assumptions: 
\par \tab \tab Number one, that the outcome of interest for cervical disease were CIN2 or higher; 
\par \tab \tab And, secondly, that the success criteria be applied to the estimates of sensitivity and specificity uncorrected for verification bias.
\par \tab \tab The first assumption is important because the December 2000 panel indicated its preference for CIN3 or above, which FDA agreed with.  Accordingly, Digene has included analyses based both on CIN2 and above and CIN3 and above.
\par \tab \tab However, the sample size of positive cases drops considerably for CIN3 and above, resulting in wider confidence intervals.
\par \tab \tab The second assumption about verification bias is important because different approaches to verification bias can result in drastically different conclusion, as I'll discuss later.
\par \tab \tab Several statistical analyses related to sensitivity were outlines in the statistical analysis plan.  The McNemar test was mentioned.  It's a standard test for data in which each patient is tested with two different diagnostic methods.
\par \tab \tab However, this test is primarily of use in comparing PAP alone with HPV alone, which is not the focus of today's presentation.
\par \tab \tab Several measures of clinical significance are defined in the statistical analysis plan.  The one we are focusing on today is a relative increase in sensitivity of the combined test over PAP alone.
\par \tab \tab This is also referred to by the FDA statistician as a decrease in false negative rate, or FNR, and is calculated as the absolute difference in sensitivity, which is the combined test sensitivity minus the PAP sensitivity, divided by one minus the PAP sensitivity.
\par \tab \tab This can also be thought of as the sensitivity of HPV when the PAP is negative. 
\par \tab \tab This measure was preferred over the absolute difference in sensitivity due to the wide variation in PAP sensitivities in these studies, and since the interpretation of absolute sensitivity depends on the PAP sensitivity.
\par \tab \tab For example, a five percent absolute difference is interpreted much differently if the PAP sensitivity is 90 percent than when the PAP sensitivity is 60 percent.
\par \tab \tab In contrast, the relative increase in sensitivity provides a more intuitive assessment of improvement that is less dependent on PAP sensitivity.  And I give a couple of examples here, that an increase form 90 to 95 percent yields a relative improvement of 50 percent, as does an increase from 60 to 80 percent.
\par \tab \tab The success criteria for this endpoint was set at 25 percent, and although it was not explicitly mentioned in the protocol how this success criteria would be evaluated, it is widely assumed that the most appropriate method is to calculate a lower 95 percent confidence bound.
\par \tab \tab The FDA reviewer used Booscott (phonetic) methods to calculate this confidence bound.  We calculated the bound using well accepted exact binomial methods which give very similar results.
\par \tab \tab For specificity, the method is simply to compute the absolute difference between PAP and the combined test and calculate the lower 95 percent confidence bound.
\par \tab \tab The success criteria was set at a difference of no more than ten percent, and the statistical analysis quite clearly indicates that this criteria was to be evaluated using the confidence bound.
\par \tab \tab You've seen these graphs before, but just to remind you in case it wasn't obvious before how this was defined, sensitivity results for CIN2 and above show that the primary outcome was met for six out of the seven studies.  Portland is not included in this graph because only CIN3 and above was evaluated in that study.
\par \tab \tab In the remaining study that did not exceed the 25 percent bound, the adjunctive sensitivity was 100 percent, and a relative increase in sensitivity is also 100 percent, and the lower confidence bound nearly met the 25 percent criteria.
\par \tab \tab Sensitivity results for CIN3, despite the reduced power mentioned earlier shows similar results.  The success criteria was met in six out of the eight studies.  In the remaining two studies, the adjunctive sensitivity was 100 percent, and the relative increase in sensitivity was also 100 percent, indicating that all cases of cervical disease missed by PAP were identified by HPV.
\par \tab \tab Thus, the test reached the maximum possible performance level, but because of the small sample size, the confidence bounds extend below 25 percent.
\par \tab \tab It's also worth reemphasizing the striking consistency between these results.  Although we have chosen not to perform a combined analysis at this time, there is no statistical reason why this could not be done, and it is clear from this picture what the overall increase in sensitivity would be, and clearly the confidence bound would be significantly higher than 25 percent.
\par \tab \tab Specificity results, again, for CIN2 and CIN3 are very similar and show that seven out of eight studies met the success criteria and that South Africa exceeded the bound by a small amount.
\par \tab \tab We've heard a lot today about verification bias, also known as ascertainment bias or referral bias.  So what is verification bias?
\par \tab \tab In most studies of cervical disease only a select group of patients are referred for colposcopy, that is, those that have some indication of disease, whether it be PAP positivity, HPV positivity, visual inspection, and so on.
\par \tab \tab this results in a large group of patients who are negative on all of the diagnostic criteria and for whom there is no colposcopic or histologic confirmation of their negative status.  And I've given an example, theoretical example here.  You can see the cells D and H which represent those situations where the PAP is negative and the HPV is negative.  Those cells do not have confirmation of disease, and so there's uncertainty about whether these double negative women are truly negative, that is, should they be in the H cell or whether some may be positive  and belong in the D cell.
\par \tab \tab In cervical disease, this bias is generally considered to be small, but any misclassification of patients as negative when they're, in fact, really positive, that is, putting them in H when they really belong in D, results in an over estimate of sensitivity and an under estimate of specificity.
\par \tab \tab Many different valid approaches can be taken to deal with verification bias.  First of all, in some studies there are no patients available for verification bias, although none in this series of eight studies.  In other words, such studies, there may be no double negative patients referred to colposcopy or biopsy.
\par \tab \tab There are several statistical methods that can be used in this situation, but this is not an ideal situation, and in particular, those methods may not be appropriate in the evaluation of a combined test.
\par \tab \tab The second approach is to do no adjustment, and this is a common approach primarily because it does not require additional assumptions and computations, and for certain outcome measures, such as, for example, the ratio of sensitivities or the number of cases of disease identified by HPV, verification bias, in fact, has no impact and can be ignored.
\par \tab \tab This is because verification bias refers to cases that were missed by both PAP and HPV, and so adjustment for verification bias simply reduces the sensitivities of both  in parallel, leaving their rankings unchanged.
\par \tab \tab If you think back to the bar graphs that Dr. Lorincz showed, even if you shrink both of the bars by the same factor, the substantial differences between them still remain.
\par \tab \tab There are several possible methods for adjustment, but this can only be done if there are some double negative patients that were referred to colposcopy, and the proportion of patients who turn out to be positive can then be used to extrapolate to the entire population of double negative patients and determine how many should be reassigned as positive.
\par \tab \tab There are generally two ways in which this can be done.  First, a random sample, where a small proportion of double negative women chosen at random are asked to return for colposcopy, while a truly random sample provides the most statistically valid method of adjustment, there are typically compliance problems with the random sample, which can bias the adjustment.
\par \tab \tab In addition, there is still considerable uncertainty about the appropriate adjustment factor since there is variability associated with the estimate.  In other words, even if no disease is found in that sample, can we really be sure that the rate is zero?
\par \tab \tab A second alternative is using directed colposcopy.  In many studies patients are referred to colposcopy for reasons other than PAP and HPV.  This sample can also be used to adjust for verification bias.  However, this is clearly less useful than the random sample since these patients are at higher risk of disease than the double negative population as a whole.
\par \tab \tab And finally, an alternative is to send all women to colposcopy and biopsy.  This is not considered to be an ethical alternative in most Western countries, and patients are unlikely to agree to participate in such a study in any case.
\par \tab \tab So, in summary, there are a variety of methods for dealing with verification bias.  None of them is entirely ideal, and it is our view that this issue must be approached with caution.
\par \tab \tab This slide summarizes the referral criteria for each of the studies in which a subset of negative patients were referred to colposcopy.  In Germany, the U.K., and Costa Rica, a random sample of double negative patients were referred for colposcopy, and in Mexico, South Africa, and Johns Hopkins, a proportion of the women were referred for colposcopy based on other clinical indications, such as self-sample HPV or visual inspection.
\par \tab \tab In China, all patients received colposcopy and multiple biopsies, and in Portland, not listed here, verification bias is not really an issue because the longitudinal follow-up is a substitute for verification.
\par \tab \tab Now surprisingly, the verification bias is somewhat different between the first four, in which all or a random sample of women were selected, and the last three, in which it was directed.  In particular, the CIN3 column, there was no verification bias in any of those first four, but there was some in the last three where there were directed colposcopies.
\par \tab \tab That illustrates the difficulty in adjusting for verification bias when double negative women are not randomly referred to colposcopy.  Clearly, while it may be inappropriate to assume zero bias in the random groups, adjustment based on the prevalence of disease in the directed groups result in significant over correction for verification bias.
\par \tab \tab This just summarizes what we have already talked about, that in China all of the biopsies performed on double negative patients were negative for CIN2 and above.  Similarly, in Germany, U.K. and Costa Rica, those patients randomly referred for colposcopy were all negative.
\par \tab \tab Based on this sample of over 1,500 women, we have reasonable confidence that verification bias is minimal.  However, as seen in the previous slide, we know that the bias is not zero.
\par \tab \tab So what approaches were taken in this application?  The primary analysis in the PMA is based on uncorrected results.  Because the focus of our presentation is on the relative differences between PAP and HPV, we believe this to be an appropriate approach.
\par \tab \tab However, in studies where there is verification bias, the absolute sensitivity of PAP in the combined tests are, in fact, overestimated.
\par \tab \tab Now, we've only had about two weeks to digest the extensive FDA statistical review, and less than 24 hours to review the statistical presentation, which is slightly different from the original review, but it appears that the FDA statistical reviewer took two principal approaches.
\par \tab \tab First, in studies with random colposcopy, a Baysian estimate was used in which the verification bias from each study is used to adjust the outcomes for that study.
\par \tab \tab It is our view that this is an overly conservative analysis since the verification bias adjustments for each study do not take advantage from all of the information from all of the other studies, namely, the 1,500 plus women who were confirmed negative from all of the studies.
\par \tab \tab And this information could be used to provide a more accurate estimate of verification bias.
\par \tab \tab Second, in studies with directed colposcopy, the disease prevalence in the verified group was used for adjustment under the assumption that the complete double negative population is accurately represented by the directed colposcopy population.
\par \tab \tab Again, it is our collective view that this, too, is an overly conservative assumption.  Not surprisingly the adjustments based on both of the methods used by the FDA result in large reductions in sensitivity for both PAP and the combined test, which also impacts the calculation of the relative improvements in sensitivity.
\par \tab \tab However, even by this very conservative criteria, Germany and Mexico were shown to be successful studies.  The FDA review also indicates that the Portland study was successful, and significantly the Portland study is the largest of the eight studies, the principal source of U.S. data, and the longitudinal study supporting the proposed diagnostic algorithm.
\par \tab \tab In the remaining five studies, the FDA analysis showed trends towards significant relative increases in sensitivity.  Based on our consultations with Dr. Schoenfeld, we believe that there are more appropriate Baysian methods to adjust for verification bias that take advantage of data from all of the studies and also make more appropriate use of the directed colposcopy results.
\par \tab \tab Because of the short time frame here we have only recently completed as a preliminary analyses and are precluded from providing that information to the panel.  These preliminary analyses show that based on appropriate adjustments, the results continue to meet the primary endpoint success criteria.
\par \tab \tab So to recap the key results, specificity results for both CIN2 and above and CIN3 and above show that seven out of eight studies meet the success criteria, and the eighth study exceeded the bound by only a small amount.
\par \tab \tab The prespecified primary outcome and success criteria was that the relative increase in sensitivity for detection of CIN2 and above would exceed 25 percent.  This outcome was met for six out of seven studies.
\par \tab \tab In the remaining study, the Baltimore study, which was the smallest study, included because of its value as U.S. data from a well known institution; in that study, the combined test identified all confirmed cases of cervical disease.
\par \tab \tab Moreover, even when the primary outcome was changed to include only CIN3 and above, as per the recommendation of the Panel and FDA, the success criteria was met in six out of eight studies.
\par \tab \tab In the remaining two studies, again, Baltimore and then China, the combined test identified all confirmed cases of cervical disease, and in fact, in China, where every single patient was biopsied, HPV identified every case of cervical disease.
\par \tab \tab Finally, we believe that the use of appropriate methods for verification bias adjustment confirms that the combined test provides significant benefit compared to PAP alone.
\par \tab \tab In summary, while PAP sensitivity is highly variable in these studies, the combined test provides uniformly high sensitivity.  Thus, from a statistical standpoint, in the studies where the PAP missed the most cases is with the studies with the best results statistically for the combined test.
\par \tab \tab Note, however, that HPV performed extremely well in all studies.
\par \tab \tab So in our view, the data presented today constitute valid scientific evidence providing reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the Digene hybrid capture II (phonetic) HPV test as an adjunct to PAP smear in the evaluation of cervical disease.
\par \tab \tab Thank you.
\par \tab \tab DR. KILLACKEY:  Good morning.  Let me bring you back to the clinic, to the patient.
\par \tab \tab My name is Maureen Killackey.  I don't have any financial investments or interests in Digene.  I've never been a speaker or investigator or consultant for them.
\par \tab \tab What I am, however, is a GYN oncologist, and I have 20 years of experience, 18 in New York City, and now for the past two years as Director of our regional cancer program in Cooperstown, New York, a very rural experience.  But that experience also brings with it treating too many women, frankly, too many women with cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab I guess I do have a vested interest today, however, in appearing here, and that is that I am a provider.  I am a clinician, and most important I also consume of these services, and with that in mind, I, too, bring in some clinical perspectives.
\par \tab \tab From the experience of a PAP smear screen for the past 60 years, we've been able to identify and describe women who we would describe as being high risk to develop cervical neoplasia.  However, this kind of diagnosis or description probably brings in most American women based on those criteria of having sex at an early age,  multiple sexual partners, or being exposed to your male partner with multiple partners.
\par \tab \tab Therefore, we clearly need to better refine the definition of high risk woman.  We need to refine it in order so that we may focus our screening resources.
\par \tab \tab Presently PAP smear screening in the United States is less than perfect.  Dr. Kinney has described that there are variations in guidelines.  There's no concordance among subspecialty groups about when to start screening, when to stop screening, or the intervals.
\par \tab \tab PAP smear providers, there are a multitude of specialists, nurse practitioners, family practitioners, as well as OB-GYNs obtaining the 50 million PAP smears that are sent in the United States annual.  Not all providers have the time or the expertise to understand the nuance of the subtleties of the PAP smear report.
\par \tab \tab And finally, there clearly are limitations to conventional dry slide cytology.  The findings from the AHCPR data that conventional PAP has a 51 percent sensitivity are sobering.  Therefore, we really need to make a good test, a good cancer screening test, even better.  We need to focus our screening efforts and provide an acceptable testing scheme for the patients and providers.
\par \tab \tab With this proposed combined testing proposal, women over 30 who are HPV positive and PAP smear negative will now be identified as the high risk group.  There clearly is potential that without adequate education of providers and patients that there may be inappropriate colposcopy referrals, over treatment, unnecessary surgery.
\par \tab \tab This must be avoided by a concerted educational effort specifically to educate people about the natural history of HPV infection.  Again, very specifically, the significance of a positive HPV high risk result in a woman over the age of 30; that is not a transient infection.  That is a condition that connotes or confers a significant risk to develop cervical neoplasia.
\par \tab \tab With this in mind, we can better define the high risk woman and, again, focus on this very small group of women that will need more diligent screening.
\par \tab \tab How about for the patient?  And that's what we're here for, after all.  Clearly, as anyone who has participated in January in the Cervical Health Awareness Month, and we certainly did in upstate New York, going to ten counties, and we had many programs for this; there clearly is a major need to educate the public.  
\par \tab \tab The public is the patient, but the public is also the parents, the kids in the high schools; to educate them about the fact that cervical cancer is a sexually transmitted disease.  So education is very important.
\par \tab \tab With education, knowledge will result, and knowledge is clearly power.  Women then will be able to control their risk factors.
\par \tab \tab We can also now  with this proposal being adapted, we can now reassure patients that -- and it's clear to the public that the PAP smear is less than a perfect test -- we can now start to reassure the public that a combination of HPV testing along with PAP smear screening will increase the sensitivity of this test.  What that means is that we as providers or we as consumers, when we get our PAP smear and invest our time, emotional energy and the cost of the visit, we can get and are assured that we will have the most accurate screen.
\par \tab \tab How will these results relate to the patient?  The HPV negative woman and PAP smear negative woman, and this will be the majority of women; greater than 90 percent of American women will be in this category.
\par \tab \tab We can clearly reduce their anxiety and reinforce their lowest behavior, that is, put them into this good category.
\par \tab \tab For the high risk patient or the HPV positive, PAP smear negative patient, clearly we as clinicians have a major input to this, and we must put it into perspective.  Yes, it is a sexually transmitted disease, but there are millions of other women who are affected with sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, trichomonas, and Herpes.  There is no need to stigmatize HPV infection.
\par \tab \tab Rather, the emphasis should be on modification of behavior, eliminating other risk factors.  This would be a tremendous effort to have smoking cessation programs, especially in the high school.  We clearly can also use this as an emphasis to stress the need for compliance.  What the doctor, what the provider tells you to do for follow-up in PAP smears, if we say a year, we mean 12 months.  We don't mean 17.
\par \tab \tab Finally and in conclusion, adoption of this proposal will clearly have a benefit to patients and to providers.  We as clinicians can now base our decisions on more objective measurements rather than subjective criteria or variations in the cytology lab of the HMO choice.  We will now be able to identify those women who need more frequent screening.  We can reassure the vast majority of HPV negative women.  We can reinforce their low risk behavior, and confidently perhaps even say that you can be screened every three years safely and confidently.
\par \tab \tab Thank you very much for your time.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  I'm Tom Cox.  I'm coming to you as a clinician and as an individual who has been intensely interested in studying clinical utility of HPV testing, which I've been doing for about the last 14 years.
\par \tab \tab I've also participated in multiple guideline committees in drawing up guidelines for PAP smear management.
\par \tab \tab I have no financial interest in Digene.  I have occasionally been supported in educational endeavors just as Dr. Kinney has.
\par \tab \tab I think we all understand the central fact of cervical cancer causation, that for most women who harbor detectable levels.  One of two things will happen.  Either they will clear HPV, and most of them will clear HPV, or they will develop CIN.  
\par \tab \tab I'll be presenting an algorithm here for management of individuals tested by both HPV and cytology, which I believe will be maximizing the detection of the latter and minimizing those of the former, and that is because this algorithm will take into account the following clinical parameters for HPV testing that are really well documented in the literature.
\par \tab \tab That only persistent, high risk HPV infection leads to CIN2+;
\par \tab \tab That HPV detection in women greater than age 30 is more likely to represent persistent infection;
\par \tab \tab And that the positive predictive value of HPV DNA for the detection of CIN rises with age, whereas that cytology decreases.
\par \tab \tab What we know is that in the end it is a combination of success of the virus in invading the immune system and its ability to exert influence over normal post gene expression that determines the emergence and persistence of CIN3.  Therefore, persistent HPV is a necessary prerequisite for HSIL and for subsequent risk for invasive cancer.
\par \tab \tab There are several issues that came out in the eight studies that were evaluated here that are of great clinical relevance.  One is it was very obvious looking at the charts that Dr. Lorincz put up that the subjectivity and variability in the reading of cytology is quite great, and it is demonstrated by the wide range of PAP sensitivity reported across the eight studies, that range being 34 to 97.6 percent.
\par \tab \tab Additionally, in contrast, all studies demonstrated very high sensitivity for the HPV test and demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in sensitivity with the subjunctive HPV testing.
\par \tab \tab Substantial improvement was also realized in several studies in this data set that had PAP sensitivities compared with that in the U.S.
\par \tab \tab Additionally, all eight studies demonstrate clinically acceptable reduction in specificity with adjunctive HPV testing.
\par \tab \tab Now, this has been mentioned before, but I think it needs to be discussed further.  There's only one organization in the United States that recommends annual PAP screen no matter what risk factors, and that is the College of American Pathologists.  All the other organizations that you see here have recommended that after two to three normal annual PAPs, that the interval for screening may be increased, and that interval increase is documented below to be from one to three years or two years or for some at least every three years, and for Canadian National Workshop report, a three year interval is recommended.
\par \tab \tab All of the above are recommended at the discretion of the clinician and are said to be based on risk factors.  We've seen these risk factors before, that high risk women should be screened more frequently than low risk women, and the definition of high risk was based, as Dr. Kinney said, on historical factors that do not have a great deal of accuracy.
\par \tab \tab They're also on issues that we often cannot discern whatsoever.  Early onset of intercourse, less than 18, history of multiple sex partners, those two issues alone put most women or the majority of women in the category of high risk for the rest of their lives.
\par \tab \tab Low socioeconomic status, immunodeficiencies, smokers, and previous dysplasia without five annual within normal PAPs, tolerant dysplasia (phonetic) are also mentioned.
\par \tab \tab But the one that most trips all of us up as clinicians in determining risk is a woman who has a partner with multiple sex partners, but we never the sex history of an individual's partners.  As a result of that, we have not been able to really categorize women adequately as low risk and put them into the screening guidelines that have been recommended for women that are not at high risk.
\par \tab \tab I would like to say that with HPV testing with cytology, we now have the first objective risk stratification for which women really are at higher risk, but we know now that higher risk women are those that are HPV positive, and those that are HPV negative, PAP negative, truly are at low risk for disease.
\par \tab \tab So with this in mind, we propose the following diagnostic algorithm:  that HPV testing and PAP smear be used only for women 30 and over, and that those that are cytology negative, but HPV positive are at a higher risk and should have HPV and PAP follow-up within 12 months, whereas those that are HPV negative and PAP negative are definitively at lower risk and may be screened according to routine screening practice recommended already by all of these organizations for low risk women.
\par \tab \tab The management of abnormal PAP smears with HPV testing results has really not changed from present guidelines for management of abnormal PAPs.
\par \tab \tab There are several safety considerations that have been raised.  We are not recommending HPV positive, PAP negative women to referred to immediate colposcopy unless there are clinical factors that make that person of concern.  A good example would be an abnormal appearing cervix, for instance.
\par \tab \tab The consequence of a, quote, unquote, false positive is not a necessary and expensive colposcopy and biopsy, but more diligent surveillance within recommended screening time frames.  Remember that a positive HPV test places a risk stratification on these individuals that allows us to know that they need to be followed more carefully.  I would not call that, therefore, a false positive test.
\par \tab \tab Safety concerns should be minimized with proper labeling on how this test should be used, and with physician education, and those of us involved in physician education will be very actively involved in getting these points across.
\par \tab \tab Thank you.
\par \tab \tab MR. KAHN:  Thank you very much.  
\par \tab \tab My name is Jonathan Kahn.  I'm a partner with the law firm of Hogan & Hartson, and we are regulatory counsel to Digene.
\par \tab \tab We have probably about 15, 17 minutes more to go.  You'll be happy to hear I only intend to take two and a half minutes.  So we will end the Digene presentation a little bit early.
\par \tab \tab First, let me say we've been trying to work with Digene and the FDA for almost two years now to figure out how best to present this to the agency and to the panel, and there has been, as you probably can tell from the presentations today, an incredible amount of work that has gone into trying to present this in a reasonable and rational way that will both serve the needs of the public health and provide the data that you and FDA need to make an educated judgment.
\par \tab \tab I think that it's best to say that we started out not at the book of Genesis.  I think we're fortunate in that we already have an approved device that has I think it's safe to say been generally recognized by FDA and the scientific community that the test is accepted as a valuable tool to follow up and screen women with ASCUS PAP smear results to determine the need for colposcopy, as well as in the management of women who have LSIL and HISIL (phonetic) cytology results by assisting with risk assessment to determine the absence of high grade disease.
\par \tab \tab Therefore, we are today really doing no more than seeking the panel's consideration and FDA's approval of an expanded screening plan for the use of HPV adjunctively with PAP.  And I think we want to make it clear that this is not a substitute for PAP under the labeling presented by the company.  Digene strongly believes that it has demonstrated today that adjunctive HPV testing provides a clinically important increase in sensitivity with an acceptable decrease in specificity.
\par \tab \tab This demonstration was based upon an analysis of existing study data rather than a prospectively designed 45,000 patient study to try to prove this to the panel, to FDA.  We believe that this was a common sensical approach.  One could imagine what would go into prospectively designing a single protocol, multi-center, 45,000 patient study.
\par \tab \tab It has -- since the passage of the medical devices amendments of '76, I don't remember an IB -- I've been doing this 27 years, but I don't remember an IBD that had that kind of data prospectively designed.  So the company decided let's look at what's a scientifically valid way to go utilizing the line data from existing studies.
\par \tab \tab And the company, I believe, thinks that the benefits were clearly demonstrated in the U.S. population by the Portland study, and that the foreign studies provided a complementary support for the very strong U.S. data.
\par \tab \tab Was the reliance on these multiple studies sometimes with differing methodologies a perfect model?  I think the answer is no, but remarkably, even with the differences in the studies, the results consistently showed a relatively improvement of sensitivity essentially independent of population differences and disease prevalences, and therefore, we believe that the approach of using multiple studies, while not what you see every day before this panel, is a very appropriate scientifically valid way to proceed.
\par \tab \tab The eight diverse clinical studies provided valid scientific evidence supporting safety and efficacy for this adjunctive claim under the labeling that you have already in your packages.  The supporting data we believe are certainly strong enough so that a clinician, based upon his or her review of the study data, can make an educated decision to recommend or not recommend adjunctive HPV screening in the identified population of women.
\par \tab \tab We believe that the recommended diagnostic algorithm just discussed by Dr. Cox is consistent with current screening guidelines.  We're not asking for any kind of revolutionary change in screening interval.  All we're saying here is that this is valuable information which we believe the clinician should have available to them through the Digene label so that the clinician can make an educated judgment as to how best to treat the women.
\par \tab \tab In sum, we believe the data support the expanded labeling claim and are more than sufficient to support the panel recommendation of approval today.
\par \tab \tab Thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Before we open the discussion up to questions, I'd like to introduce Dr. Mel Weinstein from Robert Wood Johnson in New Jersey.  Mel was kind enough to travel down early this morning, but his travel arrangements got him in a few minutes late, but welcome.
\par \tab \tab So at this point I'd like to open the discussion up for questions for members of the panel to ask questions of Digene.  I'm not sure that I'm the best one to do this particular discussion.  Perhaps Dr. Kinney, who looked at this in the Kaiser system could approach this better, but I think that under the guidelines that have been given to us in terms of allowing us to increase the screening interval for women who are considered low risk, that the sensitivity of the PAP smear as such, which is in the range of 50 percent for all CIN and probably in the range of 75 to 80 percent maximum for high grade CIN has not given us the reassurance that we needed to be able to screen comfortably women at longer intervals.
\par \tab \tab I'm concerned that with that kind of false negative potential that if we were screening women every three years we would not be able to have the reassurance that perhaps missing 25 or more percent of individuals at each screening might over a period of six to nine years for some individuals result in undetected, progressively to become basic cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab Do you have anything to add to that, Walter?
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  I wasn't involved in the discussions about what the precise numbers should be.  However, it's been clear to us from our experience with implement the guideline that involved extension from annual screening of this to longer intervals that this was nothing something that either the clinicians or the patients were comfortable with, and the more we examined that based on our own data, the more we felt that their concerns were meritorious.
\par \tab \tab In addition, looking at the number of cancers that we felt represented the false negative consequences, the false negative rate for PAP, any improvement in sensitivity would be most welcome both in terms of reducing our cancer rates and in terms of reassuring patients and the providers that we would provide an optimum service to them.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  Just one more statement.  I think one of the things that's so obvious in looking at this data is that in all of these studies, and you've been involved in HPV testing as well.  So I know you understand this, that there is an objective reliability in this test.  It has a very high sensitivity across the board.  It doesn't vary from one lab to another on any great basis in contrast to psychology.
\par \tab \tab So this very, very high sensitivity gives us a degree of reassurance that no matter what the actual absolute separation agreement happens and the HPV tests from one lab to the other, in some labs it's going to be a huge difference.  In some it's going to be less, but it's that consistent non-variability test that gives us the reliability that we need to be able to feel more comfortable.
\par \tab \tab It's screening within these guidelines that are actually promulgated around these organizations.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Noller.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLLER:  It's reasonably well known that even the high grades and CIN can spontaneously disappear.  Perhaps 20 percent or so of CIN2 and a smaller number, maybe ten percent of CIN3 lesions can disappear without any treatment whatsoever.
\par \tab \tab Do you have any information to show that the additional CIN lesions that you identify with the addition of the hybrid capture II to routine screening finds lesions that persist or progress rather than just transient infections that would spontaneously disappear?
\par \tab \tab More simply, are you just identifying lesions that are going to go away and are meaningless clinically or are you identifying true disease?
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  I don't think that any of the world literature helps us on that a great deal, and therefore, anything we do to improve detection is always with the understanding that we're going to pick up some high grade lesions that might have disappeared, but that's true with PAP smear screening as well.
\par \tab \tab We're going to pick up lesions that might disappear because we cannot predict at this point in time which lesions will progress or which lesions will not progress.  We really have to pick up all of them, I believe, to treat them.
\par \tab \tab There may be at some point in history markers which help us better determine which lesions will be progressive, but those are not available to help any of us at this point in time.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  A question for Dr. Cox or Dr. Killackey.
\par \tab \tab You said that these are not false positives when the PAP smear test is negative and the HPV is positive.  I understand your point, but what does the woman -- I mean, isn't the woman adversely affected by that?
\par \tab \tab DR. KILLACKEY:  This clearly is where education -- and it is going to be education, providers and patients -- is going to have to be very clear.  The presence of HPV positivity in the setting of a negative PAP smear means that at some point she was infected by a high risk virus, and it was as simple as that, and that's what we explain to the patient.
\par \tab \tab I think we have to explain to the patient that colposcopy biopsies are not necessary at that time; that the persistence of this infection is what really counts, and that's what confers her risk.  It's something, again, that it will take some time explaining to the patient, but women are smart.  They'll get it.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  Yeah, I'd like to add a little bit to that as well.  Over the last two or three years, there's been a great increased interest in all of the media regarding HPV.  It's really been like a still STD before this.  People didn't know about it, but it's really gotten out there.
\par \tab \tab It's been on MTV.  It's been on most of the women's magazines over and over.  It's been in the newspapers.  Women are getting very educated on this, and that will continue to increase.
\par \tab \tab What I think is important for us to always emphasize, and I always do this when I interview regarding media events or articles, is that most of the literature would give us a great deal of information now and reassurance or not reassurance, depending on how you look at it, that getting HPV is almost a part or synonymous with sexual activity; that individuals who are sexually active have a very high risk of getting this once or more times in their lifetime, and for most individuals this is a transient event with no significant long-term consequences.
\par \tab \tab And as long as you educate women that that is the case, that it is not a great threat to get this, it does indicate that until they are followed and found to not have anything by virtue of having the virus disappear or disease detected and treated on follow-up  if as necessary, that there is nothing for them to be greatly concerned about this, and I think that message can be gotten across with good education.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Lorincz?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Excuse me, but I would like to make a couple of clarifications for the previous questions, which I believe were not answered totally adequately.
\par \tab \tab First, to the question from Dr. Koutsky.  The 25 percent range we felt was a reasonable and logical number, but if you recall looking at the data most of those relative increases were much, much greater than 25 percent, around the order of 50 or 70 or 100 percent, and so we felt that that was a logical number to choose.
\par \tab \tab And perhaps we can debate it further, but I think that the clinicians agree that as a first principle if that's exceeded that's a justifiable increase.
\par \tab \tab Number two, from Dr. Noller saying three detected by HPV, firstly, we're not recommending colposcopy on the basis of an HPV positive result.  If you recall the algorithm, it says repeat the PAP smear within the year for those women who are HPV positive.
\par \tab \tab Therefore, if the women is HPV, is PAP abnormal, she gets the colposcopy on the basis of normal PAP considerations.  There is little to no evidence that most CIN3 goes away in any event.  It is either persistent or progressive.
\par \tab \tab And the last point is that there are numerous studies in the literature that demonstrate that CIN3+ detected by HPV is not different than CIN3+ detected by PAP smear or any other method, and these appear similar morphologically.  Their progression and regression rates are the same.
\par \tab \tab So I would counter that there's no evidence that there is a difference in those.  In fact, virtually all CIN3 is HPV positive.  So I think the one that have the tests are cumulatively a subset, but eventually PAP detects them all as well over many repeated years.
\par \tab \tab That's all I wanted to say.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix?
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  If I could just -- how about just your thinking behind a ten percent decrease in specificity?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Well, both the 25 percent increase, relative increase in sensitivity and ten percent increase in specificity were numbers that we had discussed at the FDA and had not been raised as unreasonable numbers.
\par \tab \tab For the sake of argument, I would say that most of the studies did not show anywhere close to a ten percent decrease in specificity.  The combined loss in specificity for PAP and HPV for most of the studies was on the order to two to three percent.
\par \tab \tab Again, we feel that that is a reasonable loss, and one needs to take a rational balance to this and recognize that we're using very strict criteria.  Women who are HPV positive, but who have no detectable disease are, in fact, as mentioned by previous speakers not false positives because longitudinal data demonstrate that persistent HPV positivity ends up turning into high grade disease if those women are followed.
\par \tab \tab So I think that one has to take the decrease in specificity in a reasonable context to recognize that at a minimum those women who are HPV positive are at higher risk, and we are recommending, therefore, that they should be followed rigorously by at least annual PAP smear screening and should not be allowed to go to the longer screening intervals.
\par \tab \tab So we feel that that is a rational approach to the decrease in specificity issue.  Okay?
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  I'm Juan Felix.
\par \tab \tab Tom, both you and Walter mentioned at least as one of your rationales that clinicians have been uncomfortable prolonging the screening interval, relying on a PAP smear that had a poor sensitivity for detecting disease.  You mentioned that the increase in sensitivity with an added test, such as HPV, might facilitate that.
\par \tab \tab And, in fact, Dr. Lorincz has mentioned that in HPV positive, PAP negative women you would follow at yearly intervals.
\par \tab \tab Now, there is nothing in the submission that I read that mentions prolonging screening intervals at all.  Why is it important -- if it's important as a strategy, there's a little bit discrepancy between this mission, what is being asked for or proposed, and what you're arguing for, prolongation of screening intervals, isn't there?
\par \tab \tab DR. FLEISCHMANN:  Yeah, I think if you look at that algorithm we presented, it doesn't say anything about prolonging screening at all.  It says that it allows us to assume intervals that are suggested by these guideline committees for low risk women.
\par \tab \tab That would be at the discretion of the clinician to decide what interval that was, but all it does is allows us to do what has already been promulgated by all of these guideline committees for women that have been designated to be low risk, and I would be surprised if -- I mean, I would suspect that most here would understand that the literature really seems to give us a great deal of reassurance that a double negative is somebody who's at low risk at that point in time.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Well, I realize that.  You know, your argument is good.  I favor the argument.  It's just that there's nothing in the submission that specifies the prolongation of screening as a target.
\par \tab \tab DR. FLEISCHMANN:  If I could respond, we are not recommending expanding screening intervals.  All we're saying is that for the HPV positive -- HPV negative, PAP negative woman, the physician can do that within his or her management of low risk women.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  To follow through the algorithm, so a woman's PAP negative, HPV positive and she comes back within 12 months, and let's say she's, again, tested with PAP and HPV or do we continue on and see what happens with these people?  What are the alternatives?
\par \tab \tab If she comes back within 12 months, what are the different alternatives for her?
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  The algorithm actually said PAP and HPV in 12 months, not just PAP.
\par \tab \tab Well, obviously --
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  Then if it's PAP, it's PAP and HPV, and she's negative for PAP, positive for HPV.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  Positive for HPV.  Well, I think that the guidelines' recommendations will be drawn up for those issues.  I would say that from a personal standpoint in a woman over the age of 30 who was consistently positive over a year's time at two different points in time, I would want to colposcope that woman, but that's my own professional opinion, and believe that it would be up to the individual practitioner to decide at that point in time whether this resulted in continued close follow-up or whether it resulted in colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  Okay.  Then in the group that is PAP and HPV negative at screening and let's say their clinician does recommend screening every three years.  Is it no being that they would then every three years be screened by both PAP and HPV?
\par \tab \tab DR. FLEISCHMANN:  I would believe so, yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  So in your management scheme, Tom, or in the one that is being advocated, the new category of PAP negative, HPV positive does not result in colposcopy?
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  That's right.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  And is that a change in current management?
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  Well, right now current management doesn't typically use HPV testing and PAP in conjunction in routine screening.  So this is a --
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  But that would be a PAP negative patient.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  It's a PAP negative patient.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  So she would go to following annual screening?
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  She would go to a screen within the next 12 months.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  With or without HPV positivity?
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  I'm sorry.  I didn't understand that.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  In other words, for most women who are screened in the United States, they're screened on an annual basis.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  That's right.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  I beg your pardon?
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  That is true, but for the reasons that I've already stated they're screened on an annual basis because they have not been able to restratify individuals correctly on the basis of historical data.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Again, okay.  It just means to me that the proposed emphasis is that if the new test allows for prolongation of screening by the clinician because if you're going to screen yearly, it doesn't make any difference whether it's PAP positive or negative.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  I'd like to clarify this point because I think it's very important.  We are saying that the HPV test provides additional information to base a risk stratification of women.  It does not result in a change in any of the guidelines.
\par \tab \tab Currently within the guidelines already exist the option for risk stratification and longer or shorter intervals.  These are based on subjective measures, such as number of sex partners, coincident STDs, whatever you may have.
\par \tab \tab What we're saying is that an HPV test is a more objective measure of the risk for that particular woman because it tells the clinician and the woman what is on the cervix that might be related to future risk of cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab So, therefore, I think it's important to take it in the context of additional information which is subsequently used at the discretion of the clinician as they see best fit in their judgment following the guidelines.
\par \tab \tab DR. KILLACKEY:  Just to clarify, Dr. Felix, the CDC data, I think, shows that 70 percent of women have had a PAP smear from the past 12 to 18 months, that 70 percent of American women get PAP smears within 12 to 18 months, and for three year screenings about 85 percent of American women.
\par \tab \tab So by no means does the American woman get a PAP smear every year.  Clearly she can't.  There are 50 million PAP smears done in this country.  There are more women than that who should be eligible for them.
\par \tab \tab So we aren't doing annual screening.  I think part of our premise as clinicians and people out there, as Dr. Cox clearly indicated, is we don't start with the premise that most women who come into our offices are high risk just based on the fact that they're heterosexually active.  Unfortunately the age of first intercourse in this country for young girls now, 15; for boys it's 14.  The fact is early sex is predominant in this country.  So early sex, multiple partners, or if you've been monogamous as a woman, who your husband or your partner brings to you.
\par \tab \tab So we all start with the premise that people are high risk.  Therefore, we really want annual PAP smear screens.  This proposal would allow us to relax those standards and go with the guidelines that ACOG and many other people say, that you're back to getting low risk.  If you are low risk based on HPV negativity, you could then be screened every one to three years at the discretion of your clinician.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  We have time for one or two more questions.  I think Dr. Nolte was next.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Yeah, I'd like to bring it back to the laboratory for a second, and talk a little bit about the performance characteristics of the test.  I know this isn't a new device, but basically this is a test without a gray zone.  It's positive or negative, and I'm a little concerned about applying this widely as a screening test without -- in order to keep the specificity appropriate.
\par \tab \tab Is there some way to deal with the information that you get from, let's say, the quantitation, the relative light units or the level of positivity?  Because that can improve the performance characteristics in terms of reducing false positives.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  You're correct in the statement that there is no gray zone in this test.  We chose a single cutoff of one picagram per mL, and any result that gave a stronger signal than that was positive.  Any specimen that gave a result below that was negative.
\par \tab \tab Some other tests do have gray zones.  We felt that it was unnecessary to establish a gray zone because the test is highly reproducible as demonstrated in the FDA submissions and approvals for ASCUS triage and also in the current submissions.
\par \tab \tab The false positives that you allude to, firstly, we want to be careful about that term because we do not believe that there is any substantial number of HPV false positives.  The test itself is very, very reproducible in terms of demonstrating the presence of absence of the virus itself.  What we are loosely calling false positive here is the interpretation of an HPV positive in a woman who does not appear to have disease.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  No, I understand that.  I'm really focused at the level of the testing.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Correct, correct.  Okay.  So in terms of quantitation, we od not have any claims pending for that.  We have not attempted to put quantitative claims into the assay, into the kit at the current point in time because we feel that the data are insufficient.
\par \tab \tab And additionally, there does not appear to be a strong correlation between the apparent levels of virus and the probability of specific categories of disease.  So we felt that the best compromise was to establish a minimum cutoff level above which the probability of disease was maximized and below which it was minimized and that this should be as much as possible maximizing the sensitivity sine in developed countries emphasis on sensitivity seems to be the predominant criterion, and that was the rationale that we followed in developing our test and in setting cutoffs.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  But you do understand my concerns that now we're switching the application of the test from a population that's enriched for disease to a population that's essentially the disease is going to be --
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  That's correct, and I believe that the data we showed in the screening context demonstrated that the decrease in specificity being only a few percent was a rational, reasonable number to accept in exchange for the dramatic increase in sensitivity provided by the test.
\par \tab \tab So we, in fact, have given you the exact data that you would expect in terms of how much the specificity would decrease.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  And just one other point.  There are several of the publications and references in the back that you provided that allude to the quantitative aspect of the test, and as you said, there's not a strong correlation between the quantity of HPV detected and disease state.
\par \tab \tab But is that data available for the studies?  The quantitative data, is that available for the eight studies?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  The quantitative data can be available for all of those eight studies, in fact, and there are other papers that are being submitted and are in consideration in the scientific literature based on viral load, but those are scientific endeavors meant for the scientific community, and we chose to not present them here at this time.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  And the last question, Dr. Tuazon.
\par \tab \tab DR. TUAZON:  I was addressing the same issues about the quantitation and correlation of disease occurrence.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to thank Digene for their presentation this morning and for helping keep us on schedule.
\par \tab \tab At this point I'd like to take a break.  Let's reconvene at 10:45 .

We're going to begin with a presentation from one of our members of the Panel, Dr. Elizabeth Unger, who's the Chief of the Human Papillomavirus Section at the National Center for Infectious Diseases in the Centers for Disease Control.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Unger.
\par \tab \tab DR. UNGER:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab I'm going to just review a little bit about HPV.  This will be familiar probably to everybody.  I'm just going to try to hit the high points in order to put everybody on the same page.
\par \tab \tab But a little bit before I start about HPV.  I've like to remind us and ask the Panel to keep in mind that not only are we talking about human papillomaviruses, but about cervical cancer screening and screening programs in cytology of the cervix has been extremely effective, to the point where a reduction in cervical cancer has been estimated to be about 80 to 90 percent with current strategies.
\par \tab \tab So we're left with a situation of trying to approve what is a good situation, and the positive predictive value is probably the best guide that we have to evaluating the efficiency of screening programs.
\par \tab \tab Our attention is turned to human papillomaviruses, and while we've been talking about them like they're an entity, they really are viruses.  There's more than 100 types, and at least 80 have been fully sequenced.
\par \tab \tab The typing is confusing.  It's based strictly on the nucleic acid sequence, and the numbering was based on the order that they were discovered.  So there's actually no relationship to phylogeny.
\par \tab \tab Because of the typing, if there's more than a ten percent sequence variation it is considered a new type, and you'll hear things called variance, and that's types that have less than two percent difference in the sequence.
\par \tab \tab There are more than 30 different types that are found in the anogenital (phonetic) tract.  They've been broken down traditionally into low risk and high risk types, and the lowest types are those that are rarely found in cancers, and high risk types are those that are frequently found in the cancers or in those precursors that are associated with cancer.
\par \tab \tab What needs to be kept in mind, that the high risk is perhaps a little bit of a misnomer because the high risk types are really those that are most prevalent in the general population regardless of the disease status.
\par \tab \tab Now, the variance which I mentioned, as the subtypes have been really been best characterized only for HPV 16, and the significance of these variances is still an area of significant investigation.
\par \tab \tab There are some really unique features of HPV, and one of the most important is that there's really no simple culture method and the antibody methods that are currently available lack sensitivity.
\par \tab \tab Therefore, it's a situation that's fairly unique.  Diagnosing the infection requires detection of HPV genetic information.
\par \tab \tab So as a corollary to this, we have to really focus very carefully on the sample because it requires a cellular sample that has to involve the site of the infection, and because of this, another fact that only current infections are identified with this approach.
\par \tab \tab And we're left with the fact that we have to use infection with a kind of a quotation mark because what we're really doing is monitoring actually only DNA detection.  The sample and the assay that's used really frame the view of the disease, and these considerations complicate definitions of what is a latent infection, occult infection, persistent infection, current infection.
\par \tab \tab Now, tissue biopsies are the best direct correlation between the pathology that's seen in the virus.  These samples include the vasolayer of the epithelium where infection is believed to be initiated.
\par \tab \tab They are very limited in the area that's screened, and biopsies are really not suitable for any kind of screening studies.
\par \tab \tab Consequently, we have been relying on exfoliated cervical cytology samples.  We know this is a noninvasive approach for population screen.  The sampling is not directed at the lesion, and there's a whole variety of ways of coping with cellular material, including swabs, brushes, scrapes, washing.
\par \tab \tab We need to keep in mind that commonly the basal epithelium is not included, and in women cervical sample is certainly the most commonly used and most appropriate, and the appropriate sample for similar screening in males is not at all clear.
\par \tab \tab Now, estimates of HPV associated disease in the United States have been made.  Approximately one percent of the population has had genital warts.  They are colposcopic or subclinical changes anticipated to be found in another approximately four percent.
\par \tab \tab There is approximately another ten percent that would have DNA positivity with no lesions, and if you include antibody positivity, which includes those that have a history of infection, you get over to 60 percent.
\par \tab \tab And given that HPV antibody methods are not positive in all of those that have been infected, you can estimate that over 75 percent of the population in the United States has been exposed to HPV.  And so that gets us back to the situation that HPV indeed is a very common and to be expected exposure with sexual activity.
\par \tab \tab Again, genital HPV is acquired around the time of sexual debut.  The usual natural history is that infection is transient and is not associated with symptoms, and it is well recognized that persistent infection is more likely to be associated with potential for neoplastic progression.
\par \tab \tab There have been already reviewed for you very elegant and consistent epidemiologic associations of HPV with the cervical cancer precursor lesions.  There are very plausible biologic mechanisms for HPV oncogenesis, and it just needs to be reemphasized that HPV oncogenesis is a really rare event with a long interval between infection and cancer, and infection alone is insufficient to cause the cancer, and additional factors are needed to be present in order for neoplasia to occur.
\par \tab \tab Now, there are many questions about HPV infection.  One of them that will come up with increasing numbers of people being tested for HPV is is HPV eliminated.  Will a person ever be cured of HPV?
\par \tab \tab HPV clearing is certainly monitored by DNA detection in cytology samples, and negative results indicate that the virus is shed below the limits of detection.  But often the basal epithelium is not sampled, and HPV in some instances has been detected in histologically normal margins surrounding growth lesions.
\par \tab \tab We really don't know what the potential for HPV persistence is in the host.
\par \tab \tab There is evidence that duration of HPV infection is generally of relatively short time frame with those oncogenic types predominantly studied are the HPV 16 and 18, having a longer degree of persistence than the lowest types.
\par \tab \tab However, a persistent infection does not have a consensus on what the definition is, and in order to really identify a persistent infection, you would have to actually identify the same HPV type on more than one occasion.  If you have a time interval between three to six months, which is what's most often used, longer intervals, you can't exclude the potential for reinfection, and consistent detection on each occasion could perhaps have a different meaning than intermittent detection, and this is really unknown.
\par \tab \tab Latent infection is kind of the formal definition of it, would be the presence of HPV DNA and the absence of a virion detection or virion production, and that's certainly not practical because we don't have any good ways of detecting the virions.
\par \tab \tab So practically, the practical definition is detection of HPV DNA in the absence of any identifiable lesion, and this is a situation of HPV DNA positive normal cytology, and this has been equated with occult infection.
\par \tab \tab Now, as I mentioned, the HPV testing is complicated by the nature of the virus and the fact that it's a family of virus.  These multiple HPV types complicate any kind of assays.  
\par \tab \tab The sensitivity and the pipe specificity varies with different assays, and inter-assay comparisons are difficult, if not impossible, and that is hybrid capture results are difficult to compare with any one other specific test.
\par \tab \tab And then just to review and reiterate what Digene has already told you, the HPV hybrid capture is the current FDA approved format.  In 1999, it was transferred to the micro titer format.  It is a liquid hybridization technique, and it uses chemiluminescent detection.
\par \tab \tab The signal is semi-quantitative, and this has been addressed indirectly by several questions at the end of Digene's presentation, but there is no control for the amount of input DNA.  The RNA probes react with the DNA targets, and the RNA DNA hybrids are both captured and detected with monoclonal antibody to the RNA DNA hybrid.
\par \tab \tab The test mix includes high risk versus low risk probe nicks (phonetic).  The results, therefore, are not type specific.
\par \tab \tab Studies to date have shown very good interlaboratory comparisons particularly when laboratories have been well trained in the actual performance of the assay.
\par \tab \tab The hybrid capture assay is designed to work with exfoliated cervical sample, and there's a recommended collection kit that includes both the brush and the sample transport media, and calculating in the yield of cells that's involved, approximately five percent of the total specimen is assayed for each of the probe groups.
\par \tab \tab Now, by comparison, HPV PCR assays target a very small portion of the genome.  The hybrid capture assays actually include probes to the majority of the HPV genome.
\par \tab \tab This allows testing of samples with poor quality DNA.  It does have the potential that small changes in the virus, such as variance or integration of the virus may give false negative results.  The amount of DNA, in other words, the portion of the sample that's actually assayed in PCR assay will vary, and it's usually less than five percent of the sample that's put into the hybrid capture reaction.
\par \tab \tab This will limit the number of cells actually sampled by a PCR test, and that's one of the reasons why standardization of PCR results is difficult to achieve.
\par \tab \tab PCR assays can be type specific, and these generally target the oncogenic region of the virus, but those that are most widely used in epidemiologic studies  are consensus assays that target the L1 region.
\par \tab \tab This then also requires additional testing to determine the specific type.
\par \tab \tab Now, the question of viral load and quantitation, whether this could potentially improve the specificity of the HPV as sort of a molecular marker for neoplasia has some problems, and part of this is because the viral load is difficult to estimate because of the uneven tissue distribution of the virus within the lesion and variations in the sample.
\par \tab \tab At the bare minimum, it requires some measure of the number of cells in the assay, that is, some sort of a denominator, and quantitative PCR assays are usually type specific and so you're limited in what you're actually quantitating.
\par \tab \tab And last but not least, just in the spirit of sort of giving everybody information on what is possible, HPV in situ hybridization is a tool that has been used in some studies.  It's really the only approach that allows direct visualization of the virus in a morphologic context, but the results are extremely technique dependent and it has a very large learning curve in order to achieve sensitivity and specificity that would be acceptable.
\par \tab \tab Now, this review was given in the spirit of just trying to put everything in the context of what HPV is, not just a single entity.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you, Dr. Unger.
\par \tab \tab Does anyone on the panel have a question for Dr. Unger?
\par \tab \tab (No response.)
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  No?  Okay.  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab All right.  At this point we'd like to move on to the FDA presentation, and again I'd like to remind Panel members that they should hold questions until both of the presentations have been completed.
\par \tab \tab I'd also like to remind the audience that only the panel can ask questions of the speakers.
\par \tab \tab The first speaker today is Mr. Thomas Simms, who is a Senior Review Scientist with the Virology Branch.
\par \tab \tab MR. SIMMS:  Good morning.  I am Tom Simms.  I am a reviewer in the Virology Branch.
\par \tab \tab And as you all know we're here to discuss a new indication for use for the Digene hybrid capture assay.  What I'd like to do today is just briefly go over the new indications for use and discuss FDA issues with the submitted study populations; issues where the device is used in the various studies; a summary of these issues; and DR. Kondratovich will present a statistical overview, FDA's statistical overview.
\par \tab \tab The indication for use that's under review today is actually, I believe, in two parts.  The first part, and I've highlighted what I believe are pertinent parts of the indication for use; that is is a general population screening test; and that in women with a concurrent normal PAP smear and a negative IV capture II HPV result, the probability  of detecting evidence of high grade cervical disease upon colposcopy is reduced relative to the normal PAP result alone.
\par \tab \tab The second part reiterates that it is a screening test, screening for women in the general population, and that it will offer a single time point assessment of the risk of having developed cervical disease, and the probability of detecting evidence of high grade disease upon colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab And since we are talking about a screening test today, perhaps it's a good time to review definitions for screening tests, and in the recent article that the }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 New England Journal of Medicine}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 , Lee and Brennan gave what I consider to be very good definitions, and they stated the screening tests should have a high sensitivity for detecting previously undiagnosed disease, and earlier detection should lead to changes in management that improve patient outcomes.
\par \tab \tab They go further to state that screening tests should also have low false positive rates so that large numbers of healthy people are not unduly alarmed or subjected to unnecessary tests and procedures and follow-up.
\par \tab \tab And perhaps this is a good time to review what the FDA review task is and what we try to do is evaluate assay effectiveness in  the specific population claimed for assay performance characteristics and appropriate assay result interpretation, and this is based on the information that is submitted to us for review.
\par \tab \tab And as we've heard previously today, the information that was submitted to us is from eight studies.  Two of these were performed in the United States.  Six are from non-U.S. sites, and information from four of the studies have been published. 
\par \tab \tab The studies were not originally designed to evaluate Digene's proposed indication for use.  Our established performance characteristics are the resulting interpretation, and Digene and the FDA do agree that the information is non-poolable across the sites.
\par \tab \tab And I'd like to make a comment that none of the studies furnish as a longitudinal component to assess the temporal relationship of HPV positivity to disease detection, and all of our comments pertaining these studies are in the context of the information being used by Digene to support a specific indication for use, and the comments are not reflective on how the studies were conducted or are they meant to evaluate the data for the original study hypothesis.
\par \tab \tab For concerns with the study population related issues, there's the issue of the study populations perhaps not being consistent with U.S. populations in that we have different high risk HPV DNA prevalence across some of the populations.
\par \tab \tab There is different CIN3 and cervical cancer prevalence across some of the populations.  There's the use of unscreened populations at at least two of the sites, and one study was longitudinal, which was converted by the applicant to a cross-sectional study where assumptions were made that if a woman was negative at baseline -- I'm sorry -- if a woman became diseased within three years of the baseline, that she was considered to be diseased at baseline; that if she was still non-diseased at ten years past baseline, she was considered to be nondiseased at baseline.
\par \tab \tab We have an issue that perhaps not all women with normal PAP smear results were exceeded to colposcopy (phonetic).  In other words, we don't have a uniform approach to account for verification bias, and as stated previously by Digene, there were two sites that did try to or did take a percentage of the negative HPV double negative patients on to colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab But then we have two other sites that perhaps cloud the issue where these sites had a self collection arm attached to it, and that women that were HPV positive and PAP negative would be going on colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab But for the self-collection part, if the woman was positive for self-collected specimen and negative with a professional collected.  She was sent on to colposcopy, but the result that was reported to us in the database was the negative result for the professionally collected sample.
\par \tab \tab Now, perhaps the patient follow-up was not consistent with U.S. practice.  We don't have times on when follow-up colposcopy or other treatments had taken place.
\par \tab \tab The study populations were not stratified for low risk women, and all of the studies applied to all women greater than or equal to 30 years of age.
\par \tab \tab We did have device related issues.  Whereas one study was not conducted with the current Digene HPV DNA device, it was conducted with an earlier version, a less sensitive version of the Digene device.
\par \tab \tab There were unapproved HPV DNA collection devices used by three studies, unapproved in the point that we do not have performance characteristics on those devices for collection of HPV DNA for use in the Digene hybrid capture assay.
\par \tab \tab Another issue we have is perhaps there were differences in cytology readings between the studies.
\par \tab \tab It's already been mentioned what Digene's currently approved indications are for.  Since we do have these current approved indications for ASCUS, low SIL and high SIL, we evaluated the data looking at women with normal PAP smears only.  We essentially have picked CIN3 as a primary cutoff because we considered that CIN3 would be less likely to regress.
\par \tab \tab There were study populations concerns.  This table shows you the various study sites, the eight study sites.  Footnote sites have -- the studies or partial of the studies have been published in the literature.  We have the specimen type used for each of the studies.  We have the lavage sample being used at Portland's cervicovaginal lavage, an unapproved brush from China, and an unapproved brush from Baltimore.
\par \tab \tab The middle column is the H range for each study site.  We can see that the China study only took women 35 to 45 years of age. 
\par \tab \tab The last column shows you the variation in how well the women were cytologically screened, and we're going all the way from an unscreened population to a well screened population.
\par \tab \tab This graph gives you an idea of the overall age distribution among the sites.  Only four sites are presented on this graph.  The orange line is census 2000 data for women within those age groups, and we can see from the four studies listed here that perhaps it has been skewed down towards the younger age group of the 39 to 44 year.
\par \tab \tab The other four sites tended to match the census 2000 data much better.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  For high risk HPV prevalence for a study site, this is some information that was furnished to us by Digene.  It's been normalized by using the percentage at each site.  
\par \tab \tab The yellow or gold bars are 95 percent confidence intervals for each study, and we can see that for the first six they tend to -- perhaps we'd be able to say that they  have a similar HPV high risk prevalence across the sites because the 95 percent confidence intervals appear to overlap.
\par \tab \tab And in our last two studies, there is a much higher prevalence of high risk HPV at those studies.
\par \tab \tab This map gives us the CIN3 rates per 100,000 for each study.  Again, this is from information that was furnished to the FDA by Digene.  Again, the yellow bars are 95 percent confidence intervals for each study.
\par \tab \tab We can see that the first four sites tend to be similar in that the 95 percent confidence intervals overlap nicely.  The last four sites appear to have a much higher rate -- it's CIN3 -- than the previous four sites.
\par \tab \tab For cervical cancer, this is from information presented to us by Digene.  This is per 100,000 population.  The gold bar is or the orange line -- I'm sorry -- is an overall rate that was obtained from the National Cancer Institute surveillance epidemiology and end results database of 1998.  The dotted gold lines are the 95 percent confidence intervals for that line.
\par \tab \tab Then we see for our first studies it doesn't seem to be approaching the overall cancer rate reported in the United States, but for our middle two, Costa Rica and Mexico, we're getting closer, but then for China, South Africa, we're much above the reported cancer incidence rate for the United States.
\par \tab \tab For device related issues, we were furnished with a study from the population that did use the previous version of the hybrid capture assay with comparison study from that population where the hybrid capture -- the previous version of the hybrid capture was compared to the current, more sensitive  version.
\par \tab \tab Positive-negative overall percent agreement was established for the study.  If we look at the lower bounds of the 95 percent confidence intervals, we're at 90 percent or less on all agreements, and from the preliminary data here it appears that perhaps the two assays are not comparable.
\par \tab \tab We were also furnished data by Digene for our issue with unapproved devices being collection devices being used in several studies, and this was preliminary data where they had taken an approved collection device that's been approved for Digene's use and comparing it to the unapproved collection device.
\par \tab \tab Again, positive, negative, overall agreement was calculated, and again, if we look at the lower bounds on the 95 percent confidence intervals, it appears perhaps that with the preliminary data that the two collection devices are not comparable.
\par \tab \tab And I have to apologize for this table.  It appears in everyone's handout.  The positive and negative columns for both the endocervical brush and cervicovaginal lavage was switched.  That was my error, but this was information submitted to us by Digene to show the comparability between the N-cervical brush and lavage.  It's information that was published by Hall in 1996.
\par \tab \tab We're really unable to evaluate the data since what we're seeing here, the groups for each of the collection methods are a different group.  They are from the same population, but they're different groups of women.
\par \tab \tab So, you know, therefore, we really can't evaluate the data, but in the paper, the authors conclude or Hall concludes that the method of collection of the cervical sample was found to be variable for HPV detection.  The samples collected with an endocervical brush were more likely to detect cervical HPV infections.
\par \tab \tab This is essentially my wrap-up table.  We have all of the various studies listed in the first column, and there is selection bias and Xes where FDA has probable issues with the studies as presented to us for Digene's indication for use claim.
\par \tab \tab For selection bias, the information presented shows that there may have been a bias in the selection of the study groups.  Some study selected participants based on no previous neoplasias within a period of time prior to the study.
\par \tab \tab Some study populations were selected for having a high incidence of cervical cancer.  In a few studies, the populations appear to be skewed towards the younger age than what's -- towards a younger age.
\par \tab \tab We have previously unscreened populations.  HIV infection was an exclusion factor for all of the studies except for South Africa.  So, therefore, the only HIV infected population that we know of is the South Africa population.
\par \tab \tab The spectrum bias that we have in some studies show the lower cervical cancer rate than reported for the United States.  Other studies had a high risk prevalence than at U.S. and European study sites.
\par \tab \tab Two of the studies had a cervical cancer incidence higher than the U.S. average, and other studies showed a higher CIN3 rate than the U.S. and European study sites.
\par \tab \tab For device bias, this is the issue, the cervical vaginal lavage specimen, and the use of approved HPV collection devices, again, for which we don't have adequate performance established with Digene's hybrid capture assay, and also testing with a less sensitive hybrid capture assay among the study sites.
\par \tab \tab For cytology reading, there's the issue that at least two of the sites at the cytology readings were converted to the Bethesda system from European nomenclature, and that at least one of the studies, we have the initial cytology being reevaluated with an automated screener and another study site was done by a second cytologist.
\par \tab \tab And now Dr. Kondratovich will present the statistical review.
\par \tab \tab DR. KONDRATOVICH:  Good morning.  My name is Marina Kondratovich.  I am statistician from Division of Biostatistics.
\par \tab \tab Today in my presentation I am going to consider the following points:  scheme of estimation; tradeoff between sensitivity increase and specificity decrease; and number of false positives dropping, one true positive.
\par \tab \tab Portland study, Mexican, South African study, Joman (phonetic) study, and the problem of verification bias and adjustment by multiple amputation techniques through Baysian approach.
\par \tab \tab United Kingdom and Costa Rica studies, overall information about increase of sensitivity, decrease of specificity; percent of decrease of false negative rate.  Sponsor give this name relative difference of sensitivity or another name you saw, relative sensitivity.  I will use term "decrease of false negative rate."
\par \tab \tab China, Baltimore studies, and summary.
\par \tab \tab Scheme of calculation.  Consider that in some studies that are in women and for every woman, she has results of two tests, HPV and PAP test.  So all of these end women will be divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D.  Like, for example, Group A, this will be the women with HPV positive and PAP positive.  B, PAP positive, HPV negative, and so on.
\par \tab \tab Here PAP (unintelligible).
\par \tab \tab We considered the combination of HPV and PAP. It means that this combination is positive.  When at least one, that is positive.  So this combination A, B and C gives us results positive.
\par \tab \tab To estimate sensitivity and specificity specifically, we have to know these studies for every woman.  It means the women from Group A, there are A-1 subjects with CIN3, plus disease, and A-2 subjects without disease.  A-1 plus A-2 equal A.
\par \tab \tab The same for Group B and so on.  The overall number n equals the number of disease subject and number of non-disease subjects.
\par \tab \tab Then from this table, we can evaluate the sensitivities of the test.  Sensitivity of the PAP test will be A-1 plus B-1 divided by the total number of disease subject, N-1.  Sensitivity of combination PAP and/or HPV will be A-1 plus B-1 plus C-1 divided by the total number.
\par \tab \tab So the difference in pre-CIN sensitivity will be C-1 divided N-1.
\par \tab \tab This suggested to consider percent of decrease in false negative rate.  This is the percent of diseased women with normal PAP results which are detected by HPV.  So it will be the ratio C-1 divided by C-1 plus D-1.
\par \tab \tab It is interesting that all combinations of PAP and/or HPV has larger sensitivity.
\par \tab \tab From this table we can evaluate specificities of this test.  Specificity of PAP test alone is C-2 plus D-2 because all these women are true negative by PAP test.  So specificity of PAP test alone will be C-2 plus D-2 divided by total number of non-diseased subjects.
\par \tab \tab The combination of PAP and/or HPV is negative only when both tests are negative.  So the specificity of combination will be only D-2 divided by this number, and difference will be always negative.  It means that all of the combinations, combination of two tests give us less specific tests.
\par \tab \tab Prevalence will be N-1 divided by total number.  Very often the women with PAP negative and HPV negative don't have verified disease study.  So very often these numbers D-1 and D-2 are unknown numbers.  And this problem with known like problem of verification bias.
\par \tab \tab If we put zero instead of true number, D1, then we decrease the total number of disease subjects, and then the difference between these two sensitivities will be underestimated.  This difference will be too optimistic.
\par \tab \tab The same for the percent of decrease in false negative rate because you see that this characteristic depends on D-1.  So if, for example, we can put artificially D-1 zero, we can get the percent of decrease 100 percent.
\par \tab \tab Verification bias can affect the estimate of sensitivity, specificity and prevalence.  Estimate of sensitivity, there tends to be overestimated and prevalence tends to be under estimated.
\par \tab \tab It is easier to make conclusion about two tests, which test is better, if we have situation where one test has better sensitivity and better specificity, but here we have situation when combination of these two tests, all have increased sensitivity and decrease of specificity.
\par \tab \tab So the tradeoff between the increase of sensitivity and decrease of specificity between PAP alone and the combination of PAP and/or HPV is very important.
\par \tab \tab The sponsor considered that 25 percent relative increase in sensitivity was being significant, but this characteristic is C-1 divided by C-1 plus B-1.  It means that if this is the point estimate of percent of decrease in false negative rate, this is the 95 confidence interval.  It means that lower limit of 95 confidence interval must be larger than 25 percent.
\par \tab \tab The sponsor considered that ten percent decrease in specificity was clinically acceptable.  It means that if this is the point estimate of difference in specificity, this is 95 percent confidence interval.  Then lower limit of this confidence interval should be larger than minus ten percent.
\par \tab \tab In reality, it's very difficult to establish one set of such numbers like 25 percent or ten percent for every study before the tradeoff between the increase of sensitivity and decrease of specificity between PAP alone and the combination of PAP and HPV depend on the prevalence of disease.
\par \tab \tab One percent of decrease of specificity in the populations with different prevalence means different numbers of women which are false positive.  So the problem characteristic like the number of false positives dropping (phonetic) true positives can be very useful.
\par \tab \tab Set for PAP alone, this is the number of false positives, A-2 plus B-2.  This is the number of true positives.  So if we consider this ratio, we will know how the number of false positives dropped in weren't true positives.  For the combination PAP and/or HPV, this is the number of false positives, and this is the number of true positives.
\par \tab \tab Also, it's very important characteristic like for PAP negative and HPV positive.  This is the amount of true positive, and this is the amount of false positive.
\par \tab \tab Then before all of these, all these women were false -- were true negative by PAP test, but after we apply HPV test, this amount of women became false positive.
\par \tab \tab This characteristic has a very useful characteristic.  First, this characteristic depends -- this characteristic already has information about the prevalence.
\par \tab \tab And second, this characteristic does not depend on the verification because as you can see in this form, there is no this number D-1 or D-2 or these numbers.
\par \tab \tab Portland study.  In this study the algorithm for verification of disease status was the following.  The disease status of women with PAP results (unintelligible) was verified.  So all women with normal PAP smear do not have their verified disease status.
\par \tab \tab HPV result was not considered in decisions of referral to colposcopy.  The assumptions that those who are disease positive within three years were presumed positive at baseline, and those who are disease negative at three years were assumed to have been disease negative at baseline.
\par \tab \tab So for statistical analysis, the sponsor used the following data.  For PAP negative, it was CIN3, 28 objects, subjects, and among these 28 women, 17 had HPV positive.  It means that HPV has detected this women.
\par \tab \tab Eleven women were not detected by HPV.  These women were false positives, 738.
\par \tab \tab So important studies, the sensitivity of PAP test was 51.7 percent.  Sensitivity of condemnation (phonetic) was 51 -- excuse me -- 81 percent.  Difference was 29.3 percent, and a lower limit of 95 percent confidence interval are calculated using bootstrap (phonetic) technique was 19 percent.
\par \tab \tab Specificity was decreased by minus 7.4 percent, and so the limit of this 95 percent confidence interval was minus 7.9 percent.
\par \tab \tab The percent of decrease of false negative rate here was 60.7 percent, 17 divided by 28, and lower limit of 95 confidence interval was 41, 47 percent.  I calculated this by bootstrap.
\par \tab \tab Mexico study.  In the Mexico study, the patients were recommended to colposcopy for any of the following:  cytology abnormality, ASCUS and above; positive HPV on clinician update sample; positive for HPV on self-collected sample.
\par \tab \tab In this study, there were 5,639 women with normal PAP results and negative HPV on clinician obtained sample.  Among them, 245 women, about ten percent, had colposcopy because of positive HPV on self-collected sample.  So this sample was not random sampled, and among these women, two women were with CIN3+.
\par \tab \tab The sponsor considered that all other 5,394 women were without CIN3.  It is too strong a conclusion.  Sensitivities will tend to be overestimated.
\par \tab \tab So here all of the subjects which are PAP negative and HPV negative.  Two hundred forty-five subjects had colposcopies, and  two subjects had disease CIN3+.  All other subjects, 243 are without disease.
\par \tab \tab The sponsor considered that all these subjects are from this group.  It means that the sponsor's estimation of increase in sensitivity and percent of decrease in false negative rate were too optimistic.
\par \tab \tab We can make only assumption that, for example, that among these subjects, the probability of CIN3 is the same, like 0.8 percent.  It means that 43 subjects among the subjects can be with CIN3, and then we should PAP to this 43 subjects.  Here it will be total number 120, and then 30 divided by 120 will be much smaller number than if I divide 30 by 77.
\par \tab \tab Of course, this estimate will be some kind of conservative because this is not random sample.  This is directed sample.  These women had colposcopy result before HPV self-collected was positive, and these women with self-collected tests are negative results, but we don't have information about performance of tests.  Excuse me.  We don't have any information about the probability of disease CIN3 above the subjects.
\par \tab \tab So the more correct adjustment for this bias is problematic.
\par \tab \tab (Unintelligible) study.  In this study the patients were referred to colposcopy for any of the following:  cytology (unintelligible) LSIL+; positive HPV on clinician obtained sample, positive HPV on self-collected sample; and two additional tests positive cervical graphics (phonetic) and evidence of disease upon direct physical examination using cervical application of five percent  acetic acid.
\par \tab \tab In this study, there were 2,160 women with normal PAP results and negative HPV on clinician obtained sample.  Among them, 575 women, about 27 percent, have colposcopy because of positive HPV on self-collected sample or other reasons.  So this sample was not random sample.
\par \tab \tab Among these women, eight women were with CIN3+.  The sponsor considered that all other 1,585 women were without CIN3.  So it is too strong conclusion and sensitivities will tend to be overestimated.
\par \tab \tab So in Africa study we have that all of these subjects are PAP negative, HPV negative.  Five hundred seventy-five subjects had colposcopy, and so eight subjects had CIN3+.  
\par \tab \tab All other subjects go to the self because they're without CIN3, but sponsor make assumption that among these subjects, there is no (unintelligible) CIN3.  So they put all of the subjects to this category.
\par \tab \tab So their evaluation of increased sensitivity is too optimistic because if we consider that among these subjects the probability of disease, like among these subjects, then it means that this subject can have 22 additional with CIN3, and here it will be 30 subjects which are not protected by PAP and not protected by HPV.
\par \tab \tab But, again, this is directed sample.  It means that this woman had positive HPV on self-collected sample or other reason, and these are different population from this.
\par \tab \tab So true adjustment for this bias is problematic.  So one estimate of increase in sensitivity is too optimistic, and this may be some kind of conservative.
\par \tab \tab German study.  In this study the verification of disease status was the following:  that cytologic abnormality of ASCUS (unintelligible); positive AC-II HPV test and it was planned that every woman with PAP negative, HPV negative will be referred to colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab In this study there were 7,193 women with normal PAP results and negative HPV.  Among them are 160 women, 2.2 percent, have colposcopy, and among them there is no (unintelligible) CIN3+.  
\par \tab \tab So the sponsor considered that all other 7,033 women were without CIN3, but it is too strong a conclusion, and sensitivities are overestimated.
\par \tab \tab For statistical analysis, the sponsors used data that there are 27 subjects with CIN3+.  PAP, HPV, and additionally detected 13 subjects, and HPV additionally created false positive rate or false positive number, 260.
\par \tab \tab So but here you see zero.  So, for example, the percent of decrease in false negative rate will be artificially zero.
\par \tab \tab So we have that problem like there are 7,193 subjects with PAP negative and HPV negative, and we observed only that 160 subjects, and among them there is no CIN3.  Can we make conclusion that all of these subjects are without CIN3?
\par \tab \tab The disease status of these 7,033 subjects can be considered submitting data problem, and I used the adjustment for verification by multiple imputation technique through Baysian approach.
\par \tab \tab In this approach you should specify a model for the prior distribution of probability or CIN3 among subjects with normal PAP and negative for HPV.  Then you should obtain posterior (phonetic) distribution of this probability on the observed data.  Here is 160 subjects and zero CIN3+.
\par \tab \tab Then make multiple simulation of the disease pattern of 7,033 subjects according to the random draws from the posterior distribution.
\par \tab \tab For Baysian approach, I used sat pry (phonetic) information.  That is this study the probability of CIN3 among PAP positive and HPV positive subjects were 13 divided by 43, about 30 percent.  Probability of CIN3 among PAP positive and HPV negative subjects were one divided by 83, 1.2 percent.  Probability CIN3 among PAP negative, HPV positive was 4.8 percent.
\par \tab \tab So I make a favorable assumption that probability of CIN3 among PAP negative and HPV negative is less than one of these three groups.  So it's less than 1.2 percent.
\par \tab \tab So I took this prior distribution, which are concentrated on this interval from zero to 142 percent with the increase in frequency now to zero.  This distribution has this mean.
\par \tab \tab Then we contracted the posterior distribution that we obtained from 160 observations, and among these observations there are zero CIN3+.  So this is the posterior distribution, and this is the mean of this posterior distribution.
\par \tab \tab So this mean is that the average probability of CIN3 among PAP negative, HPV negative subjects, if we observed that 150 subjects were within CIN3, it means that among 7,033 subjects PAP negative, HPV negative in average 30 subjects can be run with CIN3+.
\par \tab \tab Now let's compare these two pictures.  So in sponsor presentation you sat set numbers, like there are 27 subjects with CIN3, and the HPV detected additionally 13 subjects.  Sensitivity of PAP test in this situation is 51.9 percent, and sensitivity of combination PAP and/or HPV is 100 percent before it can be measured, detected.  All subjects, here is zero.
\par \tab \tab Increase of sensitivity is 48.1 percent, and percent of decrease of false negative rate is 100 percent of code because here the sponsor put zero, 13 divided by total 13, 100 percent.
\par \tab \tab Adjustment for verification bias gives us the following picture, that here it can be certain subjects because this total number women with PAP negative and HPV negative is very big number.  So among them can be 13 subjects which are PAP negative, HPV negative, but with CIN3+.
\par \tab \tab So the total number of all disease subjects will be 40.  Then sensitivity of PAP alone will be 35 percent.  Sensitivity of PAP and/or HPV will be 57.5 percent, and like compare with 100 percent.  And increase of sensitivity will be 32.5 percent.  
\par \tab \tab Percent of decrease of false negative rate will be only 50 percent.  Therefore, 13 divided by 26, if you compare with 100 percent in sponsor's calculation.
\par \tab \tab United Kingdom study.  In this study patients were referred to colposcopy for any of the following:  PAP result LSIL or worse, and ASCUS or HPV plus, that negative (phonetic).
\par \tab \tab Subjects were randomized to immediate colposcopy or all follow-up that's expected to be retested by cytology and HPV, but this study was not completed.
\par \tab \tab In this study there were 9,291 women with normal PAP results and negative HPV.  Among them are 278 women, three percent, had colposcopy, and there is not any CIN3.  So the sponsor considered that all other 9,013 women were without CIN3+.  So sensitivities are overestimated.
\par \tab \tab So for statistical analysis, the sponsor used the following data:  that in this study it was 51 CIN3+ subjects and HPV additionally detected four.  So increase of sensitivity was 7.8 percent or divided by 51, with low limit of 95 percent confidence interval.  That's 1.96 percent.
\par \tab \tab Percent of decrease of false negative rate was, of course, 100 percent, four divided by four.  Using the multiple imputation technique through Baysian approach, and I use this thing very favorable prior distribution, that the probability of CIN3 among HPV negative and PAP negative subjects is less than among all other three groups.  
\par \tab \tab We can obtain that it can be additionally 16 subjects with CIN3+.  So instead of zero, we should use there 16.  Then increase of sensitivity will be six percent, with lower limit of 95 confidence interval as 1.5 percent, and percent of decrease of false negative rate is only 20 percent, not 100 percent.
\par \tab \tab Costa Rica study.  In this study patients were referred to colposcopy for any of the following: cytology abnormality, ASCUS plus; positive cervical gratia (phonetic); suspicion of cancer upon physical examination.
\par \tab \tab Among 7,176 patients, only 769 subjects had the HPV resolved by AC-II; others by AC -- HCS (unintelligible).  The HPV status was not used as a criterion for referral to colposcopy.  An additional 128 randomly chosen women with normal screen results, it means that these tests were normal where referred to colposcopy, and among them there is no CIN3+.
\par \tab \tab The sponsor considered that other 5,632 women with normal screen results were results CIN3+.  So the sponsor's estimate of sensitivity can be biased.
\par \tab \tab The sponsor reported that the women under age 30 were likely included in this control group and that they don't have information to identify the portion of these women among 128.
\par \tab \tab Also, it isn't clear how many women were with HPV positive and HPV negative among these 128 women with normal screen results.
\par \tab \tab So the information for adjustment of verification bias was absent.
\par \tab \tab This is overall table for sensitivity and specificity of PAP test alone, of PAP and/or HPV.  So in (inaudible) submission you can see there like PAP, before months (phonetic) of PAP, combination PAP and/or HPV.  Like Portland, 81 percent; Mexico, 97.4 percent; and South Africa, 92.5 percent; in Germany, 100 percent; the United Kingdom, 100 percent; in Costa Rica, 94.1 percent.
\par \tab \tab But if we make adjustments like in Mexico because in Mexico there are directed samples; so the four months of PAP and/or HPV will be only 62.5 percent.  In South Africa, it will be only 76.7 percent, but this estimation can be conservative because these two samples are directed.
\par \tab \tab In Germany and United Kingdom we had random sample, and so we can say that this estimation is very realistic.  We cannot say that they're conservative.
\par \tab \tab So in Germany, instead of 100 percent, we have 67.5 percent, and United Kingdom we have 76.1 percent.  In Costa Rica, there is no information for adjustment.
\par \tab \tab I did not put information for adjust the specificity because it's very small differences, and so specificity is not so affected by verification bias as sensitivity estimated.
\par \tab \tab This is overall increase in sensitivity and decrease in specificity.  So in Portland study the increase in sensitivity was 29.3 percent, with low limit of 19 percent, and decrease in specificity was minus 7.9 percent, low limit of 95 percent confidence interval.
\par \tab \tab In Mexico study, in PMA submission, in the sponsor's calculation, the increase in sensitivity was 39 percent with low limit of confidence interval, 28.6 percent.  In this study the specificity was decreased minus 5.4 percent, with low limit minus six percent.
\par \tab \tab In South Africa, in PMA submission, the sensitivity increase was 8.4 percent, but with low limit of 95 confidence interval, 3.7.  After adjustment for directed sample, this increase was 6.9 percent with confidence interval, a low limit of 95 confidence interval, 3.1 percent.
\par \tab \tab In this study, the decrease of specificity was -- point estimate was minus 10.1 percent and lower limit of 95 percent confidence interval for difference was minus 11.2 percent.
\par \tab \tab In Germany, in sponsor calculation there are number like increase in sensitivity of 48 percent, but after adjustment because there are random samples and after adjustment by Baysian approach, this increased only 32.5 percent, and low limit of 95 percent confidence interval, 17 percent, 17.5.
\par \tab \tab In United Kingdom, their increase of sensitivity was 7.8, and confidence interval very small, two percent.  After using Baysian approach, increase on six percent with a lower limit of 95 confidence interval, 1.5 percent.
\par \tab \tab In Costa Rica studies, increase of sensitivity 16 percent and low limit of 95 confidence interval, 7.3 percent.
\par \tab \tab This is the percent of decrease in false negative rate.  In Portland study, the percent of decrease of false negative rate was 60.7 percent, and this is lower limit of 95 percent confidence interval.  I calculated this confidence interval using bootstrap technique.
\par \tab \tab In Mexico study, in PMA submission you can see that the percent of decrease from false negative rate, 93.8 percent, but this is too optimistic evaluation, and if we used directed samples, then percent of decrease of false negative rate is only 40 percent, and lower limit of 95 confidence interval is 28.6 percent, more than 25 percent.
\par \tab \tab South Africa, in PMA submission it was 52.9 percent, but if we use directed sample, we have only 23.1 percent, and lower limit of 95 percent confidence interval is 10.5 percent.  So it's less than 25 percent, and this confidence interval is more than 25 percent.  So maybe realistic estimation will be somebody between these two numbers.
\par \tab \tab In Germany, in PMA submission you see that percent of decrease 100 percent, but if you use random sample it's only 50 percent, and using Baysian approach, and lower limit of 95 percent confidence interval is 34.4 percent, is larger than 25 percent.
\par \tab \tab The United Kingdom, you see that the percent of decrease of false negative 
\par rate, 100 percent, but after using Baysian approach is only 20 percent and very small confidence; lower limit of 95 percent confidence interval, 4.5.
\par \tab \tab In Costa Rica this data is biased, and there is no information to correct this data.
\par \tab \tab For China and Baltimore you san see 100 percent, but this is one divided by one.  China is in some kind of unique because in this study there is no verification  bias.  All women underwent colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab And results of PAP and HPV test with disease status were foreign (phonetic).  In this study, it was 42 subjects with CIN3+, and PAP test detected 41 subjects.  HPV test detected only one subject additionally, but false positive rate was increased by 159 subjects.
\par \tab \tab So in these studies there are different sensitivities.  There was only one divided by 42, 2.4 percent.  Lower limit of 95 percent confidence interval by using bootstrap technique was zero.  
\par \tab \tab So I make conclusion that this data did not demonstrate that in case of sensitivity was statistically significant, but lower limit of 95 percent (unintelligible) confidence interval of one divided by 42 is 0.0006, but if you use exact method to calculate this confidence interval, then you don't count the variability from PAP performance.
\par \tab \tab Baltimore study.  In Baltimore study, patients were referred to colposcopy for any of the following:  PAP result LC or worse, and PCR HPV are positive results.  Women with ASCUS PAP results and negative PCR HPV were not referenced to colposcopy, and so this point excluded 57 subjects from the statistical analysis.
\par \tab \tab There was a discordant between results of PCR and AC2 HPV test.  Women with ASCUS results negative, PCR HPV test, but with positive AC2 HPV test were not referred to colposcopy, and they also were excluded from statistical analysis.
\par \tab \tab In this study there were 991 women with PAP negative and AC2 HPV negative.  The 53 women with PAP negative and AC2 HPV negative, but PCR HPV positive were referred to colposcopy, and among them there is no CIN3+.  
\par \tab \tab The sponsor considered that other 938 subjects were the subject without CIN3+.
\par \tab \tab In this Baltimore study, the sponsor considered the following data:  that there were two subjects with CIN3+, and PAP test detected one subject, and HPV detected additionally one subject.  So the difference was -- difference in sensitivities was 50 percent because PAP alone has sensitivity, 50, and combination has sensitivity 100 percent.  But first, these data are very biased.
\par \tab \tab So I make conclusions that these data did not demonstrate that increase of sensitivity was statistically significant because very small sample size and also the zero is not true number, can be not true number.
\par \tab \tab So it's very important question about tradeoff between increase in sensitivity and decrease of specificity, and obviously that this tradeoff depends on the prevalence.
\par \tab \tab The number of false positives necessary to obtain one true positive is very useful characteristic, and in this table you can see this column gives you the prevalence of CIN3, and this column gives you the ratio of false positives to true positives to the PAP negative and HPV positive.
\par \tab \tab So for the Portland study, in order to get one true positive woman, 43 women should be considered like false positive.  In Mexico, this is 11.  In South Africa, 32; in Germany, 20; in United Kingdom, 39; in Costa Rica, 23; in China, 159; in Baltimore, 22.  
\par \tab \tab I build up the limit of 95 percent confidence interval by using bootstrap technique, and you can see that this number is -- gives that estimation, what kind of false positive number you can expect.  In United Kingdom, it can be 161.  In Mexico, as much as 15.  In Portland, it can be as much as 69.
\par \tab \tab So this is the column on prevalence, and I would like to emphasize that this number is not affected by verification bias and have some information already about the prevalence of disease.
\par \tab \tab So my overall summary is that the concrete numbers of increase of sensitivity different then relative difference, affected by verification bias.  In (unintelligible) submission, the sponsor calculations, they increase sensitivity and percent of decrease in false negative rate were usually overestimated.
\par \tab \tab The submitted data of China and Baltimore studies did not demonstrate statistically significant increase in sensitivity when combination of PAP and HPV test was used.
\par \tab \tab There were no advanced judges (phonetic), the other biases, such as spectrum bias due to the different prevalence, bias due to different sample collection devices and others.
\par \tab \tab What tradeoff between increase of sensitivity and decrease of specificity acceptable is the clinical question.
\par \tab \tab Thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab And right now, Dr. (unintelligible) will present the question.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  I actually think we're going to defer questions at this time to the open committee discussion later this afternoon.  Thank you for your presentations.
\par \tab \tab At this time we're going to move to the open public hearing.  Public attendees who have contacted the Executive Secretary prior to the meeting will address the panel and present information relevant to today's issue.
\par \tab \tab Speakers are asked to state whether or not they have any financial involvement with the manufacturers of these devices, and these presentations will be in the order that they were received by the Panel.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to remind the speakers that they have three minutes each, and they'll be interrupted if they go over.  The last four presentations are statements which Ms. Poole will address.
\par \tab \tab The first presentation is by Ms. Mary Mitchell, representing ACOG.
\par \tab \tab MS. MITCHELL:  Thank you for the opportunity to provide the recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on HPV testing.
\par \tab \tab I am Mary Mitchell, ACOG's Director of Clinical Practice in the areas of gynecology, primary care, and ethics.  I personally have no financial involvement with Digene or Cytec.  Both companies are members of our Friends of ACOG program for industry.
\par \tab \tab ACOG's recommendations on HPV testing appear in Guidelines for Women's Health Care.  This week we have released the second edition of guidelines, and these recommendations are from that edition.
\par \tab \tab First, HPV testing as a primary screen.  We believe that HPV testing lacks the specificity necessary to be a useful screening test for cervical cancer or precursors because the vast majority of women with HPV DNA detected from cervical lavages would be cytologically normal.
\par \tab \tab Second, HPV testing for triage purposes.  HPV testing with identification of specific HPV types may be of value in the triage of certain subsets of patients.  Before it can be recommended for routine clinical use, however, we believe that its use, along with cytology, must be evaluated prospectively in a clinical trial.
\par \tab \tab Guidelines for Women's Health Care derives its recommendations from ACOG's Committee on Gynecologic Practice and other established authorities.  Although the second edition has just been published, the content was finalized before last year's significant events regarding cervical cytology and HPV testing.
\par \tab \tab Thus, Guidelines does not reflect the baseline results of the ALTS trial or the September 2001 consensus conference sponsored by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.
\par \tab \tab The Committee on Gynecologic Practice is currently reevaluating ACOG's position on HPV DNA testing.  Should it develop new recommendations based on these recent data, the new guidelines would be published in our }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .
\par \tab \tab In summary, ACOG recognizes the laboratory tests for the detection and typing of HPV infections are currently available in many parts of the country.  At this time, it does not appear that such testing is clinically useful.
\par \tab \tab On behalf of ACOG, I thank you for the opportunity to provide this information, and I'm happy to answer any questions.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Does anyone have any questions?
\par \tab \tab (No response.)
\par \tab \tab MS. MITCHELL:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Very much.
\par \tab \tab Our next presentation will be by Dr. Linda Alexander from the Women's Advocacy Perspective.
\par \tab \tab DR. ALEXANDER:  Good morning.  I'm Linda Alexander.  I'm immediate past President of the ASHA, the American Social Health Association, current President of Advocates for Women's Health, and I have no financial interest in Digene.
\par \tab \tab Thank you for the opportunity to provide a few statements at today's hearing.  My comments today will examine the proposed application from the women's health advocacy perspective. 
\par \tab \tab The data available today clearly support the value of this test in general population screening of women 30 and older.  It is neither my role nor platform to debate with you the significance and clinical implications of these data.  Rather, I would like to approach the discussion and decision as an opportunity to move the women's health agenda forward.
\par \tab \tab We must all applaud and acknowledge the tremendous success of our traditional cervical cancer screening and prevention efforts.  Indeed, our success in cervical cancer has been the logical foundation and benchmark for many other national and international cancer screening initiative.
\par \tab \tab Yet our efforts, while laudatory and impressive, are far from perfect.  It's tragic that thousands of women still die each year in the U.S. and thousands of others suffer with associated physical and emotional morbidity.
\par \tab \tab As a public health practitioner, I feel we should note that today we are afforded an opportunity to  move cervical cancer screening in the U.S. into a truly primary prevention activity where we will seek to identify the causes of high risk papillomavirus.
\par \tab \tab Our traditional PAP smear, while often hailed as an example primary prevention, is, in fact, a secondary prevention modality that identifies cancer after it is manifested as a disease state.
\par \tab \tab The transition for general cancer screening from a secondary to primary modality is a major public health and women's health success story.  So from a women's health advocacy perspective, it's time to admit that our standard of care in promoting traditional annual PAP testing is somewhat inadequate.
\par \tab \tab Advances in molecular diagnostics permit more than a PAP with a single examination.  The combination PAP and HPV test is invaluable to clinicians and patients in determining the absence of high grade cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab And I would submit that from an educational perspective it's time to help women understand more clearly that a normal result from traditional PAP does not equate to a clean bill of gynecological health.  It's time to help women understand that the regular gynecological exam is an opportunity not only to screen for cervical cancer cells or other high risk form of virus that causes cervical cancer, but also it's time to check for other often silent reproductive tract infections.
\par \tab \tab It's time to acknowledge that infections of the reproductive tract afflict women more often and with more adverse consequences than men.  These infections are a source of considerable shame, stigma, and anxiety.
\par \tab \tab We as a society, in spite of our sexual openness, really are socially challenges to talk about STDs.  It's time for improved communication  for women's health care.
\par \tab \tab The new proposed standard of care, PAP plus HPV test, is a tiny first step forward to break down the communication challenge.  It can help establish a new patient-provider dialogue addressing the reality that infections are rather common.  Treatments are available from the host, and that the regular gynecological exam is a forum for discussion, diagnosis, and treatment.
\par \tab \tab We are grateful to our foremothers in Women's Health Advocacy for their tenacity and determination to improve women's health.  We are grateful to our mothers who began the era of women's medical education, and we are grateful to our sisters who gained momentum in reproductive rights, and we can claim success for our efforts in the new scientific agendas in gender based biology and women's health research.
\par \tab \tab But we, the women of the new century, now have new issues to promote:  the advancement of improved technologies, improved education, and improved access in utilization of health care resources for all women.
\par \tab \tab Today women's health advocacy efforts continue, and we are the next major threshold in the era in women's health.  Medicine and health care are technological revolutions, where molecular and genetic insights and diagnostic capacities never before possible are before us.
\par \tab \tab And we are in an information age where Internet access provides anyone the latest medical studies.  Women's advocacy efforts for this century will clearly incorporate these phenomena.
\par \tab \tab Today from a women's health perspective it is as significant and important as the day that the original PAP was proposed and accepted as the standard for cervical cancer detection.
\par \tab \tab We today, the assembled team of parties with disparate interests in women's health, encourage the panel to consider the significance of this application to improve the current clinical paradigm of preventive gynecological health.  It will concurrently improve the education opportunities for women in a clinical context.
\par \tab \tab Maybe, and perhaps more importantly, today affords the opportunity for women's gynecological care to move forward into new generations of technology and information that will eventually provide comprehensive diagnostic opportunities with routine examination.
\par \tab \tab Thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab All right.  Our next presentation will be by Ms. Phyllis Greenberger, who is the Executive Director, Society of Women's Health Research.
\par \tab \tab (No response.)
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  She's not here.  Then we'll hear from Mr. Wayne Shields, who is the President and CEO of the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals.
\par \tab \tab MR. SHIELDS:  Hi.  Thanks for the chance to come today and give you some comments.
\par \tab \tab As Dr. Wilson just stated, I'm Wayne Shields.  I'm President and CEO of the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals.  I'm here and I'm speaking on behalf of our physician, nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and health research members, and our board of directors.
\par \tab \tab I'm speaking from notes.  I didn't get them included in your packet so I brought further copies for your reference later.  So you can probably get them in the back.
\par \tab \tab ARHP, my association, is an interdisciplinary membership based association, and it's composed of professionals who provide reproductive health services or education or conduct research or influence reproductive health policy.  We were founded in 1963 with a mission to educate health care professionals, public policy makers, and the general public.  And we foster research and advocacy to promote reproductive health.
\par \tab \tab We're nonprofit, and we firmly abide by national accreditation guidelines for industry support established by the FDA and established by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, the ACCME.
\par \tab \tab ARHP develops accredited educational programs and enduring educational materials for health care providers, and we also educate the public about important reproductive health issues.
\par \tab \tab We receive support from our members, from foundations, from corporations, and from government agencies for our work.
\par \tab \tab For disclosure purposes, ARHP received an unrestricted educational grant in 1999 from Digene to produce a clinical monograph.  Funding was not provided for participation today, and I have no personal interest, financial interest, in Digene.
\par \tab \tab This statement is written and presented to you to express ARHP's support for a woman's right to quality health education regarding the human papillomavirus, its relationship to cervical cancer, and the safe and effective options available for diagnosis and treatment.
\par \tab \tab We recognize the important goal of improving screening and diagnosis of HPV to reduce the unacceptably high rates of cervical cancer in the U.S., and to meet these needs, we strongly encourage all efforts to make as many safe and effective diagnostic methods available to women as possible.
\par \tab \tab It is understood that HPV is not a new emerging virus.  However, almost all of our understanding of the natural history and the epidemiology of this group of viruses has only come about in the last 20 years with the advent of sensitive molecular testing that facilitated a description of the more than 100 HPV tests that we have now identified.
\par \tab \tab We now understand that genital infections with HPV is the most commonly sexually transmitted viral infection, and that this virus manifests itself as more than just benign warts, but has the capacity for oncogenesis.
\par \tab \tab With this wealth of information as the basis for educating women and their partners, we believe at ARHP that there are sufficient data to establish the safety and effectiveness of new technologies and diagnostic options for HPV, particularly the DNA testing option under discussion today.
\par \tab \tab Approving this new option will enable women access to improved technology that can save lives, and it can do this while avoiding unnecessary procedures and visits to health care professionals and providers, and these are all important goals at ARHP.  And this is a positive step for women who have the right to accurate and reliable HPV information.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Ms. Poole, would you like to acknowledge the four written statements?
\par \tab \tab MS. POOLE:  We have a copy of Dr. Greenberger's presentation.  It's in your handout.  Dr. Greenberger stated that she felt there was sufficient data to assess the effectiveness of combination screening and urges that a decision be made as quickly as possible.
\par \tab \tab The second statement we received was from  Dr. Philip Miles, the Medical Director of GYN PATH Services, Incorporated.  Dr. Miles believes that performance cytology in combination with HPV can significantly improve our cervical cancer screening program, especially for women over 30.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Keith Reeves from Houston, Texas, believes that within the past couple of years we have been able to expedite the diagnosis and treatment of patients who have abnormal PAP smears by using the demonstrated capability of the thin prep. PAP test, and he thinks that the HPV is an important and proven testing algorithm in saving women's lives.
\par \tab \tab We also have a statement from  Dr. Elinor Christiansen, President of American Medical Women's Association.  Dr. Elinor Christiansen states that AMWA supports women's access to comprehensive, accurate, and affordable health care services, and they believe that women have a responsibility to be actively involved in their health care and supports the use of the HPV with PAP testing.
\par \tab \tab The final statement was received from Dr. Marshall Austin from Coastal Pathology Laboratories, and Dr. Austin also concludes that the increased negative predictive values of Digene's hybrid capture II HPV testing combined with liquid based thin prep. cytology offers significant improvements in sensitivity and could, with appropriate study, lead to safely lengthening of the usual screening intervals.
\par \tab \tab Thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you, Ms. Poole.
\par \tab \tab Is there at this point anyone else who would like to address the Panel?
\par \tab \tab (No response.)
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  If not, the open public hearing session is now closed.
\par \tab \tab At this point we'd like to break for lunch.  We are behind schedule.  So I'd like to reconvene the meeting promptly at 1:15 rather than one o'clock.
\par \tab \tab So 1:15.  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab (Whereupon, at 12:27 p.m., the meeting was recessed for lunch, to reconvene at 1:15 p.m., the same day.)

It is open to public observers.  However, public observers may not participate except at the specific request of the Chairperson.
\par \tab \tab At this point I'd like to ask the FDA to put up the first question.
\par \tab \tab If you could read that, I'm sure not everyone can see that.
\par \tab \tab MR. SIMMS:  The first question the FDA would like to propose to the Panel is:  does the data submitted support use of the HPV DNA testing as a general population screening test in conjunction with PAP smear, considering the non-U.S. population study showed differences in cervical cancer prevalence and screening practices versus the U.S. population?
\par \tab \tab Three studies used collection devices with unestablished performance, and one of these an invalidated matrix.  One study defined positive using any positive result up to three years after testing, and cytology readings and selection of patients for colposcopy were not standardized across studies.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab I'd also like to remind the Panel members at this time if they feel they need additional information from any of the speakers this morning, we can ask them to come up to the podium.
\par \tab \tab So at this point I'd like to open the meeting up to discussion from the panel members if anyone would like to start with any comments or questions.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  I guess I thought we were voting on does the data support the use of high risk HPV testing among women 30 years of age or older as a general population screening test in conjunction with PAP smear.  Is that --
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  This is the time to give input to the FDA, but we won't be formally voting on this.  We'll be voting on the indication later, but this is the time to answer the questions they have about the proposed intended use of the product.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  So is this Question 13 with 30 and over?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  It is, yes.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  And it's pertaining to the high risk group.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Go ahead.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  I think a lot of important information has been presented, and I would just like to address some of the issues up on the slide and some of my thoughts in reviewing the information that's been sent and listening to the presentations by both Digene and the FDA.
\par \tab \tab I think with respect to A above, I think in the U.S. we're in a sad situation where we have different screening practices for different populations, and I think it's incorrect to view the U.S. population as a homogenous population of women, and I think that, for example, we do screening in planned parenthood populations in a county south of the county Seattle is in, which has no health care system, and we have rates of CIN3 that are higher than what were reported for the China study.
\par \tab \tab So I think that there, on one hand, there's a real advantage to having a diversity of studies.  I think also there is an advantage to having studies that are not solely sponsored by the company, that are conducted by a variety of different investigators.
\par \tab \tab I think also this is a collection of studies using different procedures, different strategies for identifying women for PAP smears that were not uniformly read.
\par \tab \tab Again, in thinking about the advantages and disadvantages, another advantage is that as we've heard today and in other venues, cytology is poorly standardized, and I think there's an advantage to seeing under a variety of different conditions, a variety of different clinical settings the performance of the hybrid capture II and to be able to evaluate in a variety of different settings.
\par \tab \tab The issue around the device, to my knowledge, the unapproved devices are less sensitive than the approved device, which would actually only sort of tend to bias the results to suggest sensitivity was less than what it would actually be if a more sensitive test was used, and that may, indeed, suggest -- I just -- I haven't -- to my way of thinking, the device issue seems to be less problematic compared to the fact that performance should only improve with a recommended device.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Dr. Wilson, I wonder if I can show in a slide some of the statistical things from this morning that I think in a single slide addresses\~\_- 
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  -- addresses the issues from my perspective, and I don't know how to answer this question without asking something on that slide.  Can I show that?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  By all means, go ahead.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Greg, I wonder if you could find -- could you do that thing?
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Could I ask a question while doing that?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Sure, go ahead, Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab PARTICIPANT:  Excuse me.  Do you have it loaded onto the computer?
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  It is.  He knows where it is.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  While they're trying to find that, I wanted to ask regarding the devices, we've sort of skirted the issue, but is this panel considering HPV testing out of the liquid medium?  This preserves it as approved or not?
\par \tab \tab I think it has FDA approval.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Yes, yes.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Okay.  Because I think that in one of the studies, FDA analysis said that the Costa Rica study was not an approved device, but I think they did those out of the preserves it.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  We can ask FDA to address that.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  It's related to the collection device, not to the process and material.   The sampling device.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  The sampling device?
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Not the liquid base.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  And it's -- okay.  Because I thought that the sampling device out of the liquid base meaning it could be either the spatula and brush or the broom device.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  They were both approved for the PAP smear, but not approved for use by Digene.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  We do tests not because they're sensitive.  We do tests because we're going to change the way we behave depending on the results of the test.
\par \tab \tab So sensitivity to me is important in doing the right calculations, but this business of 25 and ten, I think, is irrelevant.
\par \tab \tab This is what I think is relevant.  The most important question is what happens if the PAP test is negative and the HPV test is positive, and so what I have here is the process over time with respect to the eight studies.
\par \tab \tab I've taken the liberty -- see, I can do that -- I've taken the liberty of actually adding up the numbers.  We're told by the FDA and the sponsor that these are not poolable, but we have to make a decision to recommend approving the device.  We're not going to recommend approving it in Portland and not in Baltimore.
\par \tab \tab There's heterogeneity in the study obviously, and that's an advantage, and the appropriate way of pooling, I think, was intimated earlier by the sponsor in Baysian hierarchical analysis.  I haven't done that.  I've just added them up.
\par \tab \tab So anyway, the total is at the bottom.  The first column of numbers is the prevalence of the disease in the various studies.  This is subject to verification bias, of course.  The first two columns of numbers are subject to verification bias.  The third one is not.
\par \tab \tab The proportions varied, and this was Dr. Koutsky's point.  The proportions varied from very small to very large.  On the average there was about one percent disease.
\par \tab \tab After you get a negative PAP, that drops considerably as you see.  Just by way of reference, the first number for Portland you remember a sensitivity of 50 percent.  The negative predictive value, therefore, drops by about a half to .028, as you see.  On the average it drops by about a factor of 25 percent or so.
\par \tab \tab Now, what does the HPV test add?  The HPV test, if it's negative, as we know, drops precipitously.  If it's positive, and this is the issue, if it's positive, the numbers come back up.
\par \tab \tab This third column is really what Dr. Condrot -- Marina --
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  -- talked about when she said the number of false positives to get one true positive.  This is the ratio of the true positives to the total number of positives, and you see -- and this is a critical issue now -- what do we do when that happens?
\par \tab \tab If we do exactly the same thing as if the HPV test were negative, then the test has no value.  I've heard people suggest that if it's positive then we might retest, call the women back after 12 months or maybe even sooner.
\par \tab \tab If, on the other hand, it's negative, then we might go for three years.  I mean, the issue to me is what are we going to tell women if this happens.  What are we going to tell physicians?  Are we going to -- and I think it's essential for the sponsor and the FDA to come up with some guidance for physicians and for women should this happen, and it had better be the case that the guidance is different depending on whether you get a negative or a positive screen.
\par \tab \tab You see that overall it increases to above the prior value, which I think is important.  It means that someone who is negative and then positive on HPV has higher risk than in the general population, and therefore, something ought to be done.
\par \tab \tab The only two studies where that's not the case is South Africa and China, but generally it increases to about four times what the prior value was.
\par \tab \tab I think that's important, but what I want to hear is what impact it will have.  Will it, in fact, mean that the screening interval will be shorter?  Will it mean that the rate of colposcopy will be greater?
\par \tab \tab And if so, then I think my answer is yes to question one.
\par \tab \tab Just a couple of other points while I'm talking statistics.  The issue of borrowing strength with respect to verification bias, I mean, verification bias is important for sensitivity.  It's less important for these calculations that I've shown here.
\par \tab \tab I do think that the borrowing strength that's suggested by the company is a reasonable one.
\par \tab \tab The issue, Killackey said women are smart, and I completely agree with that.  I've used that phrase at least 100 times in the past month in  a different context.
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  And what we've got to do is convey uncertainty to women, and I think we can do that.
\par \tab \tab The business about the gray zone, I do think -- I mean, the right-hand column depends on a positive HPV.  If it's positive or just barely positive, as opposed to negative but just barely negative, those two numbers would be quite similar, and I do think that if we are focusing on certainty, that the gray zone, the actual quantification of the viral load would be important.
\par \tab \tab So my bottom line, Dr. Wilson, is I need to know what the implications of a negative and then a positive HPV would be before I can vote.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Any members of the panel care to comment on what those implications would be?
\par \tab \tab Dr. Noller.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLLER:  I think I'm the only gynecologist on the panel, so the only person who maybe sees a lot of these women.
\par \tab \tab Women who have a positive PAP smear think they have cancer, and we spend a lot of time convincing them that it's a screening test and they need further evaluation.  There's anxiety.  There's nervousness that's appropriate, and we spend a lot of time talking to them about what a PAP really means.
\par \tab \tab Another test on top of that that's positive, whether the PAP is positive or negative, will also increase their anxiety.  All of that will translate into more colposcopic examinations, and with those examinations more disease will be found.
\par \tab \tab More disease would be found though if the PAP smear were repeated in a year and HPV testing wasn't done.  Virtually anything you do besides the PAP smear increases your pick-up of cases, if you will.
\par \tab \tab If you reread the same PAP smear on a slide twice, you're going to increase the pick-up.  So it's hard to -- I mean, you're going to pick up more disease no matter what you have, but this definitely will increase the number of colposcopies,  and as the analysis from FDA showed, we'll have to do quite a few colposcopies to pick up one case of real disease.
\par \tab \tab I think it's difficult to know where you should put that bar, one in ten, one in 20, one in 1,000.  It's very difficult, but this will increase more colposcopies and biopsies, most of which will be done in women without disease.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  And how about interval?  Will it change the interval?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLLER:  It's very difficult to know.  The annual PAP smear, in quotes, has been part of the practice of gynecology since the mid-'60s.  It's kind of unclear why annual PAP smears were -- why the annual smear instead of biannual or triennial.
\par \tab \tab Probably it has more to do with the fact that in the '60s the birth control pill was approved, and women had to get a PAP smear to get their birth control pills refilled, and the annual smear became sort of fixed at an annual smear.
\par \tab \tab And of course, there's a whole body of data about what happens if you go from annual to biannual to triennial.
\par \tab \tab Will it change?  I think it will take a long time.  The changes from always an annual smear to the recommendations that sometimes you can extend the interval have not extended it for a lot of women.  Many physicians, many patients still expect that they have a PAP smear every year, regardless of the fact that they might have had 15 negative smears and are traditional low risk and really don't need another one.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  I'd like to make a comment.  I agree with you, Dr. Noller, that a lot of the physician-patient relationship in gynecology is based on the annual PAP, and those are trends that are very difficult to break.  So, in fact, if there was an extension of screening which I inquired earlier about, it would have to involve a great deal of education to the gynecologist and to the patients.
\par \tab \tab The possible exception to that, and it's a growing trend in the United States, is managed care, and managed care, I think, the statistics are that a significant proportion of the population are in managed care currently, and if the recommendations from a managed care institution is that after a negative test the patient's screening interval is expanded, then that may be a group, a very significant group of women, where that will be instituted.
\par \tab \tab So that's the one caveat where that may occur very quickly because of the access to their health care.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab The whole comment, multiple comments that have been made about expanding the interval, are very appealing intuitively.  The problem that I have with that though is that I don't feel that we have been presented with data to support that.
\par \tab \tab If we say that that's the hypothesis, that it could be used to extend the deadline, to expand the screening interval, the data would probably support that, but I would argue that we just don't have that here.
\par \tab \tab And my concern is the concern that Dr. Noller expressed, which is that it could possibly lead to increased colposcopies.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I look at the studies that we've been presented more in the category of hypothesis generating, along with Dr. Felix's comment and those made just prior to it, that one could increase or decrease the interval for different populations based on this test is plausible, but not proved.
\par \tab \tab I mean none of the studies was designed to answer that question, and I think that's the reality of what we have.
\par \tab \tab It could be done, but we don't have the data.  I mean, the studies could be performed to validate the concept that one could increase the interval or decrease the interval.  We just don't have those data.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Durack.
\par \tab \tab DR. DURACK:  Just to extend the last two comments, I also have some concern about this area.  On the one hand, we have had several hints that this is an obvious benefit of the application, that we would extend the interval, and I think it's been mentioned several times, and clearly there are some potential benefits for that.
\par \tab \tab On the other hand, as we just heard, the data don't necessarily support it.  We also heard in the presentations we're not actually recommending that.  So we've got a little tension here between here's something good, and we're not actually recommending it.
\par \tab \tab So I think we have to be very careful with this issue.  There may also be unintended consequences, of course, which is less frequent visits.  You don't notice something else, whatever it might be.  The possibility of the unintended consequences of an extension which require further investigation.
\par \tab \tab So I guess I'm saying that perhaps this should be put to one side in answering the question, if it's possible to do that, the whole issue of extending the interval.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Good point.
\par \tab \tab Would anyone from Digene care to comment about the issue of what the impact is of a -- as Dr. Berry described it there for a PAP negative but HPV positive test?
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  As you've heard earlier, the current standards around the country are for PAP smear screening somewhere between one and three year intervals.  There is no suggestion that we want to extend the intervals past what is currently accepted clinical practice.
\par \tab \tab And in fact, if three years is considered an extension, that's already happened.  What we'd like to do is to be able to practice more safety within the confines of what is currently accepted clinical practice, and if given the tools to be able to do that, then we'll do it.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  I have nothing to add to that.  That's what we've been saying all morning, is that clinicians have not taken advantage of the intervals that have been offered in present PAP screen guidelines because of obviously concerns.  I believe that we can diminish that concern and allow that to be utilized at the discretion of the clinician.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  A little more?
\par \tab \tab DR. KILLACKEY:  I would just add and reiterate, when we do get this and they do understand this, women now know that there is a recommendation to be screened every three years.  They hear it from their health insurance companies.  
\par \tab \tab For example, there's a tremendous amount of pressure.  I constantly fight for patients to sometimes get more frequent PAP smears when it's indicated.
\par \tab \tab Women do understand, and if you just explain to them that if you are PAP negative and HPV negative, you are now a low risk woman.  Nothing is going to happen to you for the next two or three years.  It's really okay to get PAP again in three years.
\par \tab \tab We are not changing or extending guidelines.
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  The other point that warrants mention is that Dr. Noller makes mention of the increased colposcopy.  The only circumstance under which we're suggesting that should occur is if somebody has a positive cytology on a subsequent examination.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  So if I understand correctly, based on the positive HPV HC2, you're not going to do anything.  You're only going to act if you have something else, and you're going to stay within the boundaries of current guidelines based on risk, multiple aspects thereof.
\par \tab \tab Now, how exactly is this test a positive to be used to say it should be one year or three years or something in between that?  And where are the data to support that change within the current boundaries?
\par \tab \tab I mean, where are the studies that show that you can safely, effectively do that where the benefits outweigh the potential risks that have been mentioned?
\par \tab \tab I mean within the one to three.  I mean not --
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  Dr. Bosch, when he was speaking this morning, put up a slide that demonstrated five different studies with negative cytology and positive HPV that showed that the relative risk of subsequent development of high grade dysplasia was on the order of ten to 20.
\par \tab \tab We've had that same experience with our own cohort in our Portland group, and as a consequence, we feel that that's reasonable to do.
\par \tab \tab The Kaiser Portland cohort, as you're aware, is the longitudinal undertaking.  I mean, it seems to me there's a big difference between being plausible and being proved with a clinical trial.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Obviously each observer's threshold of belief is different, but we believe that our understanding of cervical carcinogenesis and of the dramatically elevated risks of subsequent dysplasia associated with carriage of HPV warrant that.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  I would have to say that although it wasn't put in the data submission here, there are multiple longitudinal studies that do show  that individuals remaining persistently HPV negative are at no risk of development of CIN3, and in fact, one study out of Holland shows that individuals that are only intermittently HPV positive have no risk of subsequent development of CIN3.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  And those are using HC2, Tom?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Birdsong, then Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  I'm concerned that there's\~-- although Dr. Cox addressed the issue of follow-up with a PAP negative, HPV positive woman this morning, you know, you stated that that was basically your personal preference, and that makes sense to me, too, but as the first comment indicated, I think, you know, despite what you said, you know, in the absence of or even if there was a specific recommendation to do something like that from the company, I think also there probably will be a lot more colposcopies because even if the, you know, clinician doesn't think they're necessary because they think there will be a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety produced by the knowledge of a woman knowing that she's HPV positive with a known increased risk, you know, in addition to whatever social stigma there might be.
\par \tab \tab And I agree with the earlier assertion that education is a very important part of it, and I'm a pathologist, but still you know, based on the conversations with the gynecologists I work with, and that's with a high risk population, I think that they will still come under a great deal of pressure to do something other than, you know, wait a year to take another look.
\par \tab \tab And you know, this is -- I don't think this is without consequence because I think even despite the best educational efforts, and I don't think that will be universal, but even with good educational efforts, I think there will probably be some significant portion of the population that misinterprets this, and it will cause real personal stress, family stress.
\par \tab \tab I recognize the increased ability to pick up cancer, and that's the overriding concern, but I think you need to have a more developed plan in place to deal with that.
\par \tab \tab And my final comment is in looking at the numbers, when we see a relatively small decrease in specificity, but that's a small decrease on a very larger number of patients, and so you're talking about a large number of women.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis?  Go ahead.
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  Yeah, may I speak to that briefly?
\par \tab \tab The decrease in specificity is a concern if, in fact, you're going to take people directly to colposcopy.  If, in fact, you're talking about not colposcoping people unless they have abnormal cytology, it's much less of an issue.
\par \tab \tab I absolutely agree that patient and provider education is the single hardest thing that we do, but I don't think it's warranted to deny the population this useful tool because it's going to be difficult to educate them how to use it.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  I think that -- and again, this is Dr. Reller's term -- I think it's very plausible that a longitudinal study would show, you know, that the interval could be safely increased, and obviously, even though the guidelines are out there now, there's obviously some hesitation in using them uniformly in different populations.
\par \tab \tab And you know, the extra data could help with that, but we've heard -- and in terms of the pathogenesis of the disease, the studies that we've been presented are essentially snapshot studies.  The virus comes and goes, and just because someone has the virus now, yeah, they're at a slightly increased risk over their lifetime for developing it, but the risk is relatively slight.
\par \tab \tab And that's why I don't think that these questions can be addressed in a single time studying.  All of the studies pretty much, except for the Portland study, were that type of study, and the baseline at the Portland study, again, was filled with assumptions based on the three year.
\par \tab \tab You know, that's the difficulty that I have with this, and that the studies were not longitudinal.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yeah, Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Going back to the Portland question, the FDA made the point about the validity of the statements in terms of the disease state in the patients in the Portland study based on the sort of one time look at three years and then assigning them a disease state at baseline.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to hear some lighter discussion about the validity of that assumption or the nonvalidity of it.  I mean, these two gentlemen here probably have a perspective on that.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  Yeah, in several of these studies you have multiple parameters used to determine whether somebody is referred to colposcopy.  Portland, I believe, we could say would be testing in cytology.
\par \tab \tab Some of the other studies included cervical photography and some didn't include cervical photography.  But you know, in all of these studies where there are multiple parameters, obviously the majority of people who are negative on all multiple parameters were not evaluated, but long term follow-up did not show significant disease developed in the people who were multiple negatives.
\par \tab \tab That is particularly true in the Costa Rica study where follow-up for seven years never found a single individual in 7,500 that were negative on all three parameters that showed up with a high grade disease or cancer.
\par \tab \tab So I think that, you know, we have reason to believe that the long-term follow-up in these did take away as far as I'm concerned the issue of verification bias as a single point analysis.
\par \tab \tab Let the real statisticians speak to that.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  Just a quick clarification.  I think what might have been a bit confusing is the estimate at one point in the materials sounded like it was just measured at three years, and at other points it was anything accumulated up through three years and estimates all of the CIN3s that occurred up through three years.
\par \tab \tab MR. CANNER:  That is correct, and actually I wanted to talk a little bit more about the Portland study because we do have a longitudinal study, and the data are actually, I think -- and the clinicians can address the clinical relevance of this -- in the Panel pack on page 66, Table 23, there's a Kaplan Meier curve from the Portland study.  The study was, you know, some women or the women were followed all the way out to ten years, at least some of them, and so we have a good estimate of risk over that time period.
\par \tab \tab And after two years, the risk or the survival probability or disease free survival probability was 100 percent after two years and .999 after three years.  In other words, the risk of disease was zero after two years and one in 1,000 after three years.  I'm sorry, in the PAP negative, HPV negative group.
\par \tab \tab And they also compare that to the PAP negative, HPV positive group.  Granted the risks in that group are not large.  This is a rare disease, but the relative risks are very significant, and it clearly shows that you can go out two or three years with an almost nonexistent risk of cervical disease with the negative/negative.
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  When we write our practice guidelines, the thing that we rely on most is the experience in our own population, or if we don't have that, in populations closest to ours.  The study has now been going on for a decade, as was indicated, and up to this point we haven't seen anything to tell us we're wrong.
\par \tab \tab This is a study of the size that permits us to draw this conclusion based on the study alone.  It's a 10,000 personal longitudinal cohort for ten years.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Where is that Kaplan-Meier curve again?
\par \tab \tab MR. CANNER:  Page 66.  I'm told it's page 86.  Maybe I have a different version, but -- page 66, Table 23.
\par \tab \tab And also to address the issue of how the\~\_- sorry.
\par \tab \tab (Pause in the proceedings.)
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  I think when you get a chance to look at that anyway, you'll see that this study, this one large, 20,000 cohort study followed for ten years in the United States is enough to answer the concerns and questions that we have expressed on this panel today.
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  And the sample size I mentioned is the sample size of the patients over 30.  It is, in fact, a 20,000 person cohort in toto.  I was only making reference to those patients who were informative for the indication that's being discussed today. 
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  I'd like to point out a few other issues related to the Portland study which I think will help the Panel and audience understand this study better, and especially Dr. Beavis who questioned the availability of longitudinal data.
\par \tab \tab The full extent of the Portland study was not submitted to the FDA because of our rather limited claims.  This is the largest natural history, longitudinal prospective study that has ever been done.  It started out with 23,000 women in Portland, and it spanned ten years.
\par \tab \tab And I can give you a few snapshots, and this is all available in a full scientific paper that has been prepared that is not part of this package.
\par \tab \tab Of the disease, CIN3, that was detected over a period of ten years, and I believe the number was 148, the PAP smear originally identified approximately 30 to 35 percent, and the HPV test, a single time -- these are a single time baseline performance -- identified 67 percent, and the two together identified 75 percent, or three quarters of all CIN3 that developed in the entire ten  year period in this group of women, which I believe is a very impressive demonstration of the long-term protective effects of having an HPV and PAP negative result.
\par \tab \tab We believe that the use of cervical vaginal lavage for the HPV test at baseline biased against the value of the HPV because it has been demonstrated that simply washing the vagina will not get endocervical cells, which are more likely representative of high grade lesions.
\par \tab \tab And in fact, if you look at other studies, such as ALS (phonetic), which has not been mentioned, or many of our other studies that use the brush device, the sensitivity was much higher.  So, therefore, there's already an impressive detection of long-term disease which we believe with the correct brush device would actually be higher, not lower.
\par \tab \tab And I think that that study answers a lot of the questions that have been discussed here at the Panel with respect to longitudinal versus cross-sectional data.
\par \tab \tab We chose three years because we wanted to convert to a cross-sectional format for the purposes of introducing consistency across all age studies.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Dr. Wilson, I wonder if I can ask something about this.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Go ahead.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Sine we are hanging a bit on this table, I want to make sure there is no difference in the ascertainment of CIN3 in the HPV positive as opposed to HPV negative.
\par \tab \tab I mean if, for example, we were to follow the guidelines that we were just talking about and the positive had annual tests and the negative had every three years or even more, then you would find more obviously in the positive.
\par \tab \tab Was there an ascertainment difference?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Does this work?  Can you hear me?
\par \tab \tab The Portland study was a masked, longitudinal, unbiased study.  The HPV --
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  But presumably the women knew that they were positive.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  No, they did not.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  They did not know.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  For HPV they did not know, absolutely not.  In fact, to be specific, the HPV, it was a retrospective prospective study.  All women at baseline had HPV testing collected, and these were stored in a refrigerator, minus 70 degrees, and they were all analyzed between last March and last April.
\par \tab \tab So, in fact, nobody, not the clinicians, not the epidemiologists knew the HPV status.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Thank you.  I appreciate your clarifying this for me.
\par \tab \tab Are you saying that essentially over the ten years 138 women developed cancer?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  One hundred and forty-eight of the women were detected to have CIN3.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Okay.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Using repeat PAP smears, the average was probably about three.  Some of the women had over seven PAP smears during that interval.  So there was a wide diversity because Portland was practicing the variations in follow-up, as we have seen.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  All right, but the combination of PAP and HPV detected approximately 75 percent?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Seventy-five percent.  PAP alone was -- on the first baseline.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  Not over time.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Not over time.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Well, you see, that's my question.  Because 148 women are going to be diagnosed with it over a ten year period.  Okay?  But at time zero, 75 percent of these 148 women are picked up --
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  With PAP and HPV.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  -- by a combination of --
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  -- PAP and HPV.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Approximately 35 percent by the single PAP
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  But not at time zero.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  At time zero, that's correct, because the --
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  So my question is:  for the women who were going to be developing it at year eight, but who are, you know, HPV positive at time zero, what would have happened to them in those eight years?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  They got repeat PAPs, and there was no disease detected on the particular time point.  Let's say at year eight, but --
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Wait a minute.  We're saying that we're not going to be doing anything more than additional PAPs following a positive HPV.  How would this HPV testing impact what the physician and the women are doing?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Because it's done more frequently.  If the PAP has a certain sensitivity limitation, every time it's performed you miss 40 to 50 percent of the disease.  The way you get to a cumulative sensitivity of 99 percent is by repeating it multiple times, let's say, five or six times.
\par \tab \tab If you can determine the appropriate risk group on which to do more frequent versus less frequent PAPs, you end up with a higher overall sensitivity for all the groups.
\par \tab \tab And what we're saying is that current guidelines already permit PAP smears up to every three years, and we're simply stating that if the risk to the woman is known with respect to an HPV positive, it is suggested that she be tested more frequently with the PAP to increase the probability that the disease we suspect is there will be detected as opposed to her being a loss to follow-up who develops a malignancy.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  There's 148 women who developed cancer in that period.  What percentage of them had a positive PAP smear at some point during that period?
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Of the 148 women who developed?  All of them because the way they were found was by repeat PAP. 
\par \tab \tab This also answers Dr. Noller's question.  In the Portland study, the women with disease over the ten year period were only found by the PAP smear.  They were cumulatively found by doing multiple repeat PAPs, and when there were a sufficient number of abnormalities, maybe LSIL, HSIL, whatever it was, they were referred to colposcopy, and then the disease was detected.
\par \tab \tab So all of them were detected by PAP.  What I'm saying is that only about 35 percent of them were detected as positive at the baseline PAP, and the rest of them required multiple repeat PAPs to be detected.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Gutman.  Your mic is not on.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  I don't mean to be a spoil sport here, but we're really moving into information that has not been reviewed by the FDA.  We actually looked at this study fair and square as a cross-sectional study, not as a longitudinal study, and it really isn't customary to move into a discussion of new areas in the course of the panel.
\par \tab \tab So as rich and interested as I actually think this is, I actually think we've strayed a little too far.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  I'm sorry.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  But may we talk about the three years that you did review?
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  Okay.  The clinical utility of this is that in the three years following the onset of the study the negative predictive value for a negative HPV and a negative cytology was asymptotic to 100 percent.  That's the basis for feeling that it's acceptable from a clinical perspective to contemplate two or three year screening in women who are double negative.  That's the utility from our standpoint.
\par \tab \tab The study doesn't exit in a vacuum.  One of the members of the panel did ground breaking work about this that I'm sure she'd be willing to tell you about, and there are four other studies that were on one of the slides that we talked about also.
\par \tab \tab Do you want to help me here Laura?  No?  Okay.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  The other thing that I'd like to state is that actually the algorithm we proposed was to do a PAP and an HPV test in a random hear in that basis, and multiple studies, we can talk about these as well.
\par \tab \tab It's shown that people with transient HPV that are evaluated in the studies from the first time of detection, about 70 percent of them would become HPV negative by the year, and these are individuals that are not at risk.
\par \tab \tab I think we need to take that into account and realize that we're not going to be using this as an immediate evaluation scenario, but one which gives us information in the future.
\par \tab \tab Those people are still positive for the year.  Then they are at risk that warrants colposcopy, at least in my professional estimation.
\par \tab \tab And the early detection is the key to the outcomes that we get.  We talk about people being in the Kaiser system, and they'll come in year after year, and it's free for them to get it, but many people are transient themselves and move around and may not get constant care.
\par \tab \tab I don't believe that missing some CIN3s will always go without consequence, that some people do get cervical cancer in this country who have been screened adequately.  There are about 3,000 cases, well, about 30 percent of 12,800 cases in the United States that have had cervical screening on what could be considered to be an adequate, if not perfect, screening schedule.
\par \tab \tab So I think we need to keep these things in mind when we talk about all of these issues.
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  Pursuant to that same question, Dr. Noller had asked me earlier about isn't the decreased detection simply high grade disease that would go away on its own, and the incidence of invasive cancer after a negative smear suggests that that's not true, that that 30 percent both in our data and in the SEER information suggests that there are people who have negative PAPs who have CIN3 that go on to cancer.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay. Other questions from the Panel regarding this question?  Comments?
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  I have a question.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes.  Could FDA put the first question back up?
\par \tab \tab Go ahead, Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  In the U.S. a fair percentage of women who have abnormal PAPs don't follow recommended follow-up because I think it's -- at least it's my understanding that particularly with ASCUS, it's unclear.  The clinicians don't want to say, "You have cancer," and so they minimize it and women are left with this feeling of they're not sure what they're supposed to do with ASCUS.
\par \tab \tab My question around HPV is:  has Digene done any work to look at whether the messages that are given with the positive versus negative HPV test result in a better response to recommended follow-up even just among the data they have with women with ASCUS and HPV testing where it's positive or negative?
\par \tab \tab Is there any -- a big problem in the U.S. is this follow-up.  I think their best studies suggest only somewhere between 30 and 70 percent of women who are recommended for follow-up, colpo. follow-up or a repeat PAP, actually adhere.
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  I believe there isn't a lot of data on that.  I'm not sure you haven't looked at it yourself in your area, but certainly in the ALTS data from center to center there wasn't, I believe, a statistically significant difference in follow-up between those that were HPV positive and those that were HPV negative.
\par \tab \tab One of the interesting things about the ALTS data is that the women coming in ASCUS HPV positive had much more detection of CIN3 than the women going into premier colposcopy who did not have HPV status known, and the only thing that we did surmise from that was that the clinicians were more likely to be observant of the cervix and consider it possibly having disease and be more careful about where they did their biopsy points and where there's a significant difference between that and the colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab I don't have any other data than that.
\par \tab \tab DR. KILLACKEY:  Dr. Koutsky, I don't think we can equate an ASCUS PAP smear with the same thing as knowing that you were HPV high risk positive.  An ASCUS PAP smear, when we all would get them back and give them to our patients, we really truly didn't know what the significance of that would be, and most of the time it isn't significant.
\par \tab \tab Positive HPV screen in a 30 year old woman means something.  It means she has, as the data have shown, a predilection to develop cervical neoplasia.  So now we do have a piece of information that does confer a significant risk.
\par \tab \tab ASCUS doesn't do that.  ASCUS  says, as reported back in the country, and the two and a half, three million PAP smears, we really had no idea what to do.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Well, I'm not sure you can say that because the rate of abnormalities in an ASCUS population is very almost identical to the rate of abnormality in an HPV positive population, if not higher.  The rate of positive high grade disease in the ASCUS population is ten percent.
\par \tab \tab So I'm not sure that you can say that.  I mean, there is a large number of women who have nothing, 80 percent, but still the rate of positivity is very significant.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Excuse me.  You haven't been recognized.
\par \tab \tab We want to take a very short break here because we're having some technical problems with the sound system.  So we're just going to stop for about five minutes.  If you want to stretch your legs, that's okay, but don't go too far and try to be back within five minutes.

One possible thing is someone may have something plugged in somewhere, into one of the electrical circuits in the wall.  So if you have something like that, please disconnect it.  It could be something such as a battery charger or something like that.
\par \tab \tab Because some data were mentioned by the sponsor that have not been part of the review, FDA would like a chance to comment on that data.  I'm going to turn it over at this point to Dr. Gutman.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  As beguiling as that data is, we really were a little over the edge.  It really was moving into an area of information that could be submitted and could be evaluated, but has not, and we really need to ground it in the data that's at hand.
\par \tab \tab So I'm going to ask Marina if she will do that by grounding it in the data that is at hand.
\par \tab \tab DR. KONDRATOVICH:  So this is the data for important study, and I would like to bring your attention that the amount 28 subjects are HPV not detected, 11 woman, and detected 70.  So this 11 woman can have the full security that they don't need to do PAP test during three years.
\par \tab \tab And so what it can -- so what is your opinion about this?
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Marina, these are PAP tests at baseline?
\par \tab \tab DR. KONDRATOVICH:  This is the problem because --
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab DR. KONDRATOVICH:  Yes, this is PAP test at baseline.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  And so those 11 were actually those that were found in subsequent PAP smears.
\par \tab \tab DR. KONDRATOVICH:  Yes, but they have HPV negative.  So if they  decided not to detect it during this three years by PAP test, so this woman will be missed, and this is about 40 percent from this woman.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  So does anyone on the Panel have any questions about that?
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  Could you just put up the summary statistics also for the Portland study?
\par \tab \tab DR. KONDRATOVICH:  But this is the summary (unintelligible) time point measurement.  This is at baseline.  So this study has some kind of an error because this is on baseline.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Could you go back to the previous one?
\par \tab \tab The 11 should be compared with the 9,053 because both of those had the same characteristic.  One got disease and the one didn't.  So the predictive value is 11 over 9,000 or something.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Any further questions or comments regarding those data?
\par \tab \tab DR. KONDRATOVICH:  So right now we don't get the information about we can extend the period for three years.  So the data which are presented in that kind of table because the HPV doesn't appear to have any inference for extending of period of between PAP tests.  So we don't know exactly what is the probability for this event.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Gutman, do you have any further comments?
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Not at this time.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  At this point we need to wrap up the discussion on the first question.  Are there any issues that anyone on the Panel would like to bring up on the first question before we move on to the next?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  There was some discussion at some point about doing a simplified data analysis including only those issues that were cytologically negative and looking at that.  Was that done?
\par \tab \tab DR. KONDRATOVICH:  In my own presentation I also speak separately about the PAP negative, and especially you can pay attention to my last slide about the number for what it takes to get one true positive.  This is particular for the PAP negative, the cytology (unintelligible).
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Also, the table that I put up was for a PAP negative, and by the way, that referred to CIN3.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Any further comments about the first question?
\par \tab \tab Dr. Gutman, do you think you have enough information at this point?
\par \tab \tab Okay.  If we could have the FDA put up the second question, please.
\par \tab \tab MR. SIMMS:  Question No. 2 we would like the Panel to comment on:  is Digene's criteria of decreasing the false negative rate lower than 25 percent and not decreasing specificity, in other words, the true negative rate, by more than ten percent acceptable to measure the benefit of adding high risk HPV DNA testing to the normal PAP smear?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  I answered this for myself previously.  My answer was no, that you need to address the implications of the test, what the consequences are, and that sensitivity and specificity, while relevant, are not the only things nor the important things to address.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Are there any other comments or questions from the Panel?
\par \tab \tab Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  To some extent I think basically all you can address is the sensitivity and specificity because the positive and negative predictive values will vary so much by different populations depending on the prevalence of the disease.
\par \tab \tab So I'm not sure if there were different criteria, what would you propose would be better criteria?
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Well, I do think positive predictive value and negative predictive value is the appropriate thing.  You know, what is the implication as you go along the sequence from here we start, here we get a PAP and then we get an HPV, and addressing the consequences of the positive and the negative results of the various tests.
\par \tab \tab So, I mean, if the prevalences of the disease is very low, then sensitivity, I mean, even if we get sensitivity of 100 percent, it doesn't matter.  What matters is what is the impact on health policy.  What is the impact on an individual woman?
\par \tab \tab And sensitivity and specificity don't address that because they don't address the absolute risk or the absolute benefit.  What they address is a relative risk and relative benefit.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Yeah, and again, even though the concept is correct, and I think we discussed this slightly in a side bar, I believe that the clinical aspects to that, to sensitivity add, even though it does not add to the positive predictive value  in that positive predictive value does not take into account future risk of disease in women who are HPV positive and currently disease undetectable, but who will develop the disease.
\par \tab \tab So it mirrors a little bit of what Dr. Cox said, that it has to be treated carefully.   How do you treat a false positive test?
\par \tab \tab So I'm not 100 percent in agreement that the positive predictive value is the only thing we should consider because it is greatly affected by the fact that you're counting them as false positives when, in fact, they might not be false positive.
\par \tab \tab And if we are going to look at thresholds like sensitivity and specificity, I think that clinically speaking a 25 percent improvement in sensitivity is a reasonable threshold.  I think that it is certainly a -- I couldn't come up with a better one looking at the data myself.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  I could come up with a better one.  The better one is zero.  The standard thing to do in medical research is to ask the question:  does something matter?  Does the treatment affect the disease?
\par \tab \tab And here we're asking:  is the conclusion affected by the test?
\par \tab \tab If sensitivity is statistically significant, then you say, "Okay.  We know it does something.  Now let's get on with the question of what does it do and what are the consequences."
\par \tab \tab So if it were me, I would say, "Let's test the hypothesis that sensitivity is better with HPV than it is without HPV, and if it is highly statistically significant, let's get on with the real question."
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes, Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  In regard to the 25 percent increase or decrease in false negative rate, I already spoke my mind about the false positive issue, but this is still, after all, proposed as an adjunct to improve cancer screening, and I think the most important aspect of the screening test is actually the negative predictive value, again, affected by prevalence of the disease in the population, but in all of the studies the negative predictive value is so good with this that I think that 25 percent is reasonable.
\par \tab \tab As for the ten percent decrease in the specificity, you know, I have concerns about that, but I've already spoken to that.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Other comments?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  The relative risk for developing cancer in the double negative group versus the group that has a positive HPV test is fairly well established, and that seems to me, I mean, we're talking about -- that hasn't come up as a parameter here, and I wonder why it hasn't.
\par \tab \tab And using that as validation for the extended, you know, application here, it seems like it's a reasonable one to me.  I just wonder why that hasn't been part of our discussion today.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  We did look at a table that addressed that, but it was suggested that that that hadn't been presented to the FDA, and so we couldn't do it.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Well, the data was in the packet.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  The data in the packet is kosher.  What I was concerned about was when we started introducing other longitudinal data.  So what you see is what you got.  Either we or the sponsor missed it, and if you'd like to discuss it, you're certainly free to do that.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  The bottom line is after five years there were seven per 1,000 in the HPV negative, and there were 47 per 1,000 in the HPV positive.  those are PAP negative.
\par \tab \tab So that's a rather dramatic difference.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  That for me is the most meaningful parameter, not positive predictive value, not sensitivity, not specificity.  That is what argues strongest with me.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  I agree that's very relevant.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Ng.
\par \tab \tab DR. NG:  Well, I was hoping to address Rick's question by looking at the table on the number of false positives versus true positives if you were introducing HPV testing.  It means depending on the prevalence that ratio was anywhere from ten to one up to 40 to one, up to if you live in China in a high prevalence setting 160 to one.
\par \tab \tab So you know, if you were providing this test and yield a positive HPV result with a negative PAP, how are you going to counsel that woman at that point in time?  And I think those are the numbers.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Just one quick comment on that.  One hundred and sixty to one was one patient to 159, and the average was 15, I think, over the entire set, which is a relevant consideration comparing those two.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Weinstein.
\par \tab \tab DR. WEINSTEIN:  Well, that cuts right to the core of my question and degree of comfort or discomfort, namely, how many false positives are you willing to accept for each true positive?
\par \tab \tab I don't know the answer to that, but that's the dilemma that's going around in my head.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  I agree.  Exactly what does that false positive means is something that adds to the complication, at least in my mind, because there may not be false positives, but it's undetectable disease, and I do colposcopy.  There's times when I'll do colposcopy in three biopsies on a patient, and that patient has disease.  It's just that we missed it on those.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  And part of the complication with this whole incident of false positive or not is we have to realize that what the test is detecting is the presence or absence of virus at that time, not the presence or absence of cancer.
\par \tab \tab And that's why we can come to different conclusions as to whether or not it's a false positive or not depending on whether we're looking for virus or whether we're looking for cancer and using the test as a surrogate marker for cancer.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Noller.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLLER:  This is purely semantic, but none of this has to do with cancer.  We're looking at cancer precursors.  Let's just remember that.  These are not cases of cancer we're detecting, but interepithelial neoplasia, some of which if left untreated might develop cancer.  But this is not cancer.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  All right.  Are there any further comments or questions about the second question?
\par \tab \tab (No response.)
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  If we could have the FDA put up the third question, please.
\par \tab \tab MR. SIMMS:  The third question we would like the Panel input on:  if the Panel does find the new indication for use as a general population screening test acceptable, how might the device be labeled and what recommendations should be made for its use given the different populations and conditions used to derive the data and the non-poolable nature of the data?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Noller?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLLER:  Just one comment.  We received a huge volume of paper and different copies of things.  In some places the indication suggested that hybrid capture II was to be used for this.  Others said a high risk panel of hybrid capture II.
\par \tab \tab I just want to be clear we're looking at only the high risk panel, right, not the low risk panel?
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  That's correct.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLLER:  Though it wasn't specifically stated that way in most of the stuff I saw.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Yes, that's correct.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLLER:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  If I put that sentence in my Microsoft Word document, it would underline it saying the sentence is too long.
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  It's too long for me.  If we separate out the given part, what comes after given to me is kind of a red herring.  As I suggested, we have to make recommendations for -- we have to do the synthesis, and so you can't say that studies are not poolable and the eventual decision had to pool them.
\par \tab \tab But if we can separate that out and just focus on the first phrase, I think that would help, and I don't have much to contribute to that except that I think it's absolutely critical.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Further comment?
\par \tab \tab I think the FDA is looking for some help here about if there's any concerns that the Panel members have about what sort of weighting or recommendations could be used to mitigate those concerns.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Well, Dr. Wilson, this is related to the stuff that we talked about earlier about prolonging the interval of screening, about maybe an earlier or a more frequent PAP test about colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab I assume from what the sponsor has suggested that the sponsor would say, "Do not do colposcopy if you're PAP negative, HPV positive," and so they are presumably recommending that that recommendation be put in the labeling.
\par \tab \tab I don't know whether that's a correct thing to do or not, but it's a can of worms
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Other comments?  Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  I've heard two opposing views, one from the sponsor and one from the FDA on the poolability of the data.  I heard one set of statistical consultants say that the data was poolable, and I heard the FDA say it was absolutely not poolable.
\par \tab \tab Not being a statistician, I don't know how to respond or how to process that information.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Just to correct my -- my interpretation is that I'm the only one in the room that said it should be pooled.  The sponsor said it's not poolable, and the FDA said it's not poolable.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Oh, okay.  I thought -- okay.  That's all right.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  But I think that Dr. Koutsky's comment that, in fact, our population in the United States is not poolable either is very pertinent.  In other words, you don't screen an upper middle class neighborhood the same way that you screen an urban population, and the cancer rates in both places are radically different.
\par \tab \tab So I think that if anything there's a strength to a variety of studies and even though the data is not poolable, I think it reflects the nature of cervical cancer screening in the United States fairly well.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Noller.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLLER:  I have a question and then a comment based on the answer to the question.  Is the algorithm now part of the amendment?
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Presumably the suggestion for the label change is part of what's being reviewed.  So my suggestion and partial answer to this would be that\~\_- 
\par \tab \tab (Pause in proceedings.)
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  That's an interesting answer.
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab MR. RELLER:  -- would be that the algorithm should be part of the labeling.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Any other suggestions or recommendations for the members of the panel?
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  I concur.  I think that if found acceptable, clearly the issues that have been most important in our discussions have been the consequence of the positivity in the PAP negative patient.  There has to be guidance for the user on that occurrence in the labeling.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Any other comments?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Well, the point that comes up when we talk about this a lot is that the labeling we're talking about goes into the package insert, correct?  And the package insert is something that the laboratory sees as it does the test.
\par \tab \tab And the question is that's a fairly ineffective way to communicate that information to the physician that's actually receiving the information and having to interpret the test.
\par \tab \tab So it's one of those things, and it brings up to me the responsibility of the medical community versus the sponsor for establishing new -- pushing a certain set of practice guidelines in which there's an area that doesn't seem to be any real consensus.
\par \tab \tab When I heard the representative from ACOG stand up here and say there was no clinical value to HPV testing, I thought that was a bit of a -- that was a surprise to me because I always thought there was some clinical value to it.
\par \tab \tab But you know, what we're talking about here is how much clinical value and what sort of situations.  And I just don't -- I guess I'm reluctant to put a big burden on the sponsor to do all of this by themselves knowing, number one, that it's going to be ineffectual, and number two, I'm not sure it's their responsibility.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Any other comments or questions?
\par \tab \tab Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Molecular assays, including hybrid capture PCR, have been of tremendous importance in understanding the potential viral role, pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma, and there is in -- the hybrid capture test for HPV is approved.
\par \tab \tab So what I hear us discussing is what should be the criteria for extension of an indication, I mean, a further labeling deployment of a test that is already available.
\par \tab \tab But the central issue, it seems to me, is what data are there to alter clinical practice based on the test so that the availability of this test would enable the studies for refinement of extant guidelines..  Btu we don't have those data available that would enable an appropriate guidance to be put into the labeling, and until those data are available, it seems to me, we have a test that's been approved by the FDA.  It's available for doing the longitudinal studies that would be required; that the tools or at least one tool -- it's not the only tool, PCR, other things -- the tools are available to refine the guidelines, but until one has the studies that would enable that refinement, these are tools, and we should not be putting into labeling what would, in essence, be alter guidelines based on no data that proves their applicability.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you, sir.
\par \tab \tab All right.  At this point we'd like to go ahead and take our regularly scheduled break.  One, they'd like to still do some more work on the sound system, but also we'd like to give both the sponsor and FDA time to polish up their responses and make sure everything is working.
\par \tab \tab So let's reconvene as close as we can to about ten minutes after the hour.
\par \tab \tab Thank you.

\par \tab \tab (No response.)
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  There being none, we'll close the open public hearing.
\par \tab \tab We'll move into the industry response.  At this time the sponsor may provide comments to respond to any issue that's been raised during the committee discussions.
\par \tab \tab And I would note that this is limited to five minutes.
\par \tab \tab DR. KINNEY:  I want to take one minute of that five for a couple of purposes.  The first one is to talk about the issue that you raised about the relationship of ACOG to new technology and the Practice Committee.  As a Fellow of the college, I think that I'm permitted to talk about that.
\par \tab \tab They don't have access to the data that this panel does.  They're only permitted to consider peer reviewed published articles, and then there's a substantial deliberative period after the article has been published.
\par \tab \tab To give you an idea about what the time line is like, in 1997 we had clear evidence that hybrid capture II was useful for triage.  In 1999, a similar panel reviewed that information and agreed.  In 2002, ACOG is still deliberating over whether or not that's, in fact, the case.  And they'll come along.  They're just not there yet, partly because they don't have access to the same information.
\par \tab \tab The other issue has to do with there's been a lot of discussion about false positives and the concern about the adverse effects associated with having to do 15 tests on the average to pick up one woman with disease, and that's a meaningful issue only if the consequences of being found to have HPV are really adverse.
\par \tab \tab If in fact this is used in the fashion that we have suggested, the adverse consequences are limited to having an annual PAP smear, which I think the members of the Panel that practice cytopathology would tell you is a perfectly acceptable notion.
\par \tab \tab That leave out the issues of provider education, which we talked about is important and is the single hardest thing that we do, but I don't think that that's a reason not to give us this tool
\par \tab \tab DR. COX:  I have several points.
\par \tab \tab A prospective clinical study to answer the questions that would be ideal according to many members of the committee, in particular, with an endpoint of cervical cancer detection is obviously just not feasible.  I don't think that's something that can be done in this country.
\par \tab \tab I think that is a concern always to submit women to excessive colposcopy.  I've always felt that way, but I do believe that this can be handled through education, and that I'm more concerned about the three to 4,000 women who lose their lives every year due to cervical cancer or at least get cervical cancer -- I'll put it that way -- that have had reasonable screening.
\par \tab \tab I believe that we can make a significant impact on that and that we should not deny them that potential.  And there was also a suggestion that clinicians could just go ahead and use this test this way without having an indication approved because it's already approved in ASCUS management.
\par \tab \tab But I believe that approval in this particular adjunctive situation with PAP and primary screening has very important public health implications that exceeds greatly the importance of previous approval in ASCUS management, and approval here would be a confirmation of this.
\par \tab \tab And finally, as with any new indication, there has to be guidelines developed and will be developed.  They are usually not developed before an indication is given, and as one who serves on several guidelines committees, I believe quickly these committees will respond to develop via the best literature available throughout the world guidelines on the use of HPV testing in conjunction with the PAP.
\par \tab \tab And I believe that labeling cannot be any stronger in its recommendation than what we have put forth here because until those guidelines have been developed both by professional organizations, this will be up to clinician discretion and guided by the education that we can provide in respect to guideline group input.
\par \tab \tab DR. LORINCZ:  I'll make some concluding remarks.
\par \tab \tab Speaking on the company, they are scientists with extensive experience in the field of HPV diagnostics.  So we maintain that our data from these eight diverse studies support the proposed claim for adjunctive use of HPV testing with the PAP test in women over the age of 30 in the U.S.
\par \tab \tab The FDA present that their concerns related to a variety of biases, the most important of which appear to be device bias and verification bias.
\par \tab \tab With respect to the first of these biases, the use of alternative collection devices, we have presented data that indicate the CVL bias against the added HPV test.  Yet we were still able to show a large improvement in sensitivity in the Portland study.
\par \tab \tab It's our opinion that the analyses show that the FDA concerns, while mitigating to some extent the apparent  value of our presentations, do not introduce a sufficient level of concern to change the take home message.
\par \tab \tab It is precisely the diversity of the study sites, collection devices, ethnic groups, et cetera, that demonstrate the robustness of the Digene hybrid capture HPV test as an adjunct to the PAP.  To state it succinctly, we observe the same trends of improvement when adding HPV testing to the PAP in all of these studies.
\par \tab \tab With respect to the second perceived important bias, verification bias, we do not believe that adjustments for this bias change the fact that HPV plus PAP is a much more sensitive test than the PAP alone.
\par \tab \tab It is the opinion of our statisticians that the use of overly conservative verification bias adjustment is not a reasonable approach as it uses only part of the information available and applies the worst case assumptions to all of the data.
\par \tab \tab Even with the worth case assumptions, three of our studies met the previously agreed criteria of improvement.
\par \tab \tab The Digene HPV test will provide several clinical benefits.  Perhaps the most important, it will allow an objective classification of women into low risk versus high risk groups.  There is no recommended change in screening intervals beyond those currently in place in the U.S.
\par \tab \tab We confirm that the proposed algorithm as presented today will be part of the labeling if allowed by the FDA and will allow us to embark upon extensive education measures.
\par \tab \tab I'd like to conclude by reminding you all that there was a remarkable level of concordance among the eight studies in terms of key parameters and the final overall conclusions, namely, that HPV added to the PAP test produced a large gain in sensitivity that was much greater than expected by chance along.
\par \tab \tab Furthermore, this gain in sensitivity was accompanied by only a minor decrease in specificity which Digene maintains is a worthwhile tradeoff for the clinicians and the women of this nation.
\par \tab \tab Thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab At this time we'd like to have the FDA's comments.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Well, I'd like to thank the sponsor for providing us with an interesting and challenging set of data and for their cogent presentation this morning.
\par \tab \tab And I'd like to thank my colleagues at the FDA for putting on the table what we view is the appropriate questions and issues.  The agency obviously does think HPV testing is pretty important.  We've approved this test already for use in a subset of normal PAPs, and we brought you up here from all across the country to get your best advice fair and square on an extension of the claim to use this in the subset or the large subset of women who have negative PAP smears.
\par \tab \tab It is important to the agency that we insure rapid technology transfer.  It is important to the agency that new intended uses be rapidly available, and of course, it's important to the agency also that these be grounded in safety and effectiveness, and Ms. Poole will be actually reading you the definitions of safe and effectiveness shortly as you approach the final vote.
\par \tab \tab For IVDs, I think it's self-evident that there's a unique link between safety and effectiveness in that the safety and effectiveness are always around the recurrent theme of true versus false positives and true versus false negatives, and what the information content has in terms of information impact on the patient.
\par \tab \tab This has been a challenging submission for us.  It's been, I'm sure, challenging for the sponsor, and it will be challenging and has been challenging for you because of what is known and not known about the performance of the device itself and what is known and not known about the implications of the use of this device in this new setting,
\par \tab \tab We appreciate the wisdom, the advice you've already given before to the wisdom of your vote in determining whether the data set establishes safety and effectiveness and makes this test ready for prime time or whether, indeed, more or different data is needed.
\par \tab \tab Thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you, Dr. Gutman.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  At this time we'd like to move to the final recommendation, and Ms. Poole will give us both the guidelines on the voting as well as a list of the voting members on the panel today.
\par \tab \tab MS. POOLE:  The regular voting members seated at the table this afternoon are Dr. Kathleen Beavis and Dr. Laura Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab Appointment to temporary voting status, I have a memorandum to read from Dr. Feigel.
\par \tab \tab "Pursuant to the authority granted under the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, charter dated October 27, 1990, and as amended August 18th, 1999, I appoint the following persons as voting members for the Microbiology Devices Panel for the duration of this Panel meeting on March 8th, 2002:  Donald Berry, Juan Felix, Frederick Nolte, Barth Reller, George Birdsong, and Janine Janosky.
\par \tab \tab "For the record, these people are special government employees and are either a consultant to the Panel or are a consultant or voting member of another panel under the Medical Devices Advisory Committee.  They have undergone the customary conflict of interest review.  They have reviewed the material to be considered at this meeting."
\par \tab \tab And it signed David W. Feigel, Jr., March 5th, 2002, Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
\par \tab \tab The recommendations for voting on a premarket approval application or supplement.  The medical devices amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, "the Act," as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, allows the Food and Drug Administration to obtain a recommendation from an expert advisory panel on designated medical device premarket approval applications that are filed with the agency.  The PMA must stand on its own merits, and your recommendations must be supported by safety and effectiveness data in the application or by applicable publicly available information.
\par \tab \tab Safety is defined in the act as a reasonable assurance, based on valid scientific evidence, that the probable benefits to health under conditions of intended use outweigh any possible risk.
\par \tab \tab Effectiveness is defined as a reasonable assurance that in a significant portion of the population the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use when labeled will provide clinically significant results.
\par \tab \tab Your recommendation options for the vote are as follows:
\par \tab \tab Approval if there are no attached conditions;
\par \tab \tab Approvable with conditions.  The Panel may recommend that the PMA be found approvable subject to specified conditions, such as physician or patient education, labeling changes, or a further analysis of existing data.
\par \tab \tab Prior to voting all of the conditions should be discussed by the Panel.
\par \tab \tab Not approvable.  The Panel may recommend that the PMA is not approvable if the data do not provide a reasonable assurance that the device is safe or if a reasonable assurance has not been given that the device is effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.
\par \tab \tab Following the voting, the Chair will ask each Panel member to present a brief statement outlining the reasons for their vote.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  At this time, I'd like to read the proposed indication for us as provided by the FDA.  It states that as a general population screening test, in conjunction with the PAP smear, for women ages 30 years and older as an aid to determine the absence of high grade cervical disease or cancer.
\par \tab \tab It further states that in women in a concurrent normal PAP smear and a negative HC2 HPV result, the probability of detecting evidence of high grade cervical disease upon colposcopy is reduced relative to normal PAP smear results alone based on the increased negative predictive value of the combined use of both methods.  This result is not intended to deter the patient from proceeding to colposcopy should other clinical indicators warrant such action.\tab 
\par \tab \tab Okay.  Given Ms. Poole has stated there are three potential ways that the committee can vote, at this time I'd like to open it for motions.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I move that we find the requested supplement not approvable.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  We have a motion for a vote for not approvable.  Is there a second to that motion?
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  I'll second that.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  We have a motion and a second.  Is there any further discussion or comments by the members of the Panel?
\par \tab \tab Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Yes, I have a question.  If I wanted to vote approvable with conditions, how should I vote on this motion?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  You would vote nay on this motion.
\par \tab \tab Are there any further questions or comments?
\par \tab \tab (No response.)
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  I'd like to call the vote then.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Reller has moved and it's been seconded that we vote not approvable.  All those in favor signify by raising their hands please.
\par \tab \tab We'll do it by voice.  Dr. Reller?
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Just a clarification.  You mentioned in our instructions that not only must we vote, but also that we must give the rationale for our vote.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes, following the vote, correct.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  So after the vote is when we give the rationale?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes, yes.  We just need to go through one by one on our vote.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Can I ask -- can I ask you to repeat the indication?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  The intent of the proposed indication?
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  I'd be happy to.
\par \tab \tab The proposed indication for use is that as a general population screening test in conjunction with a PAP smear for women ages 30 years and older as an aid to determine the absence of high grade cervical disease or cancer.  In women with a concurrent normal PAP smear and a negative HC2 HPV result, the probability of detecting evidence of high grade cervical disease upon colposcopy is reduced relative to a normal PAP result alone based on the increased negative predictive value of the combined use of both methods.
\par \tab \tab This result is not intended to deter the patient from proceeding to colposcopy if the clinical indicators warrant such action.
\par \tab \tab Are there any other questions or any other points that the Panel members would like to have clarified?
\par \tab \tab (No response.)
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  So we'll proceed around to the voting members then first.  Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I vote in favor of the motion.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  And Dr. Birdsong?
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  Could I ask for a clarification on that before I --
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Go ahead.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  We are voting on Dr. --
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Reller's motion that this test be classified as not approvable.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  I vote no.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Vote no.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  The motion does not carry, the vote being three votes for and five votes against.
\par \tab \tab Let's still go ahead and go around and have each person give their reason for their voting on this motion.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  The FDA has previously considered this to be an approvable test for the indication of detection of HPV, and that I think is, you know, accepted, and it gives us a tool to have the studies conducted that would enable us to have an accurate database for this supplement.
\par \tab \tab The data that we heard presented do not provide that database, and until we have how this test is to be deployed, that is, what is the practitioner to do differently based on this test.  Negative, X period of interval between giving repeat PAP smear; positive, X period.  Until the data supporting those specific recommendations for alteration of practice are in hand, I think we have nothing more than what we have now, namely, a test that is of demonstrated value for proving the presence of an agent that is highly associated with or, even put another way, without which there is evidence with the high risk viral types that one doesn't get cervical carcinoma, which is a necessary, though not sufficient, ingredient.
\par \tab \tab So the bottom line is that it's a good test, but we do not have the data for alteration in the deployment of the test in clinical practice, which to me is the essence of the request for the amendment.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Dr. Reller voted not to approve.  I voted against that.  My arguments are almost identical to his.
\par \tab \tab I agree completely with what he said, and I think it's being a bit picky about what is approvable with conditions, and so my conditions are really quite strong and I'll tell you about what they are the next time around, although I'm a little bit worried that I'm going to vote against everything, including motions to approve.
\par \tab \tab Just one correction of something that I said.  I said an average of 15 false positives per true positive.  It's really 25 to one.  I misspoke.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Cox said about the one that women lose their lives, and see, I don't think anything like that has been shown.  This one true positive, what is the medical management of that patient?  Would she have, for example, had a PAP smear the following year and found that she had precursors to cancer and treated accordingly?  Losing their lives has not been shown in the submission.
\par \tab \tab Just to say again what Dr. Reller or my version of what Dr. Reller said, it is not clear from the submission how the test should be used, and it is not clear from the submission how the test will be used, and those will provide the basis for my conditions next time around.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  I actually had a similar assessment.  I see a test, and I see a test that's detecting, but I'm not so sure what that tells me in terms of what should happen in clinical care, what should be the outcome from the test.
\par \tab \tab In terms of having it list for the indications, that's why I voted to note approve.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  I voted against the motion because, one, the indication that they're requesting, that the sponsors are requesting is limited and doesn't go into many of those things that are most suggested by Dr. Reller.  It's actually very limited in its scope.
\par \tab \tab And just reading it, everything that they say in their indication has actually been proven.  That's why I voted.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.  
\par \tab \tab Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  I voted no because I feel that the information we were given documented the indication that there was evidence supporting the indication for use.
\par \tab \tab I also thought long and hard about the issue of a perfect trial, and having just participated in ALTS, which I think was about as perfect as you can get, it essentially replicated what Walter Kinney had shown in a Kaiser study and several other smaller studies have shown, and with thinking about randomized clinical trial, the concern always comes down to I do -- because of the studies I'm doing, we're trying to take into account verification, but there isn't a good way to do it.  You are left with data that will always be imperfect, and the question becomes how much more imperfect data do we need.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  I voted in favor of the motion to reject for a few reasons.  One, I don't feel that the data are present in the current submission, and I'm brought back to the two things that we're supposed to be considering, and that's the safety and the efficacy part of our charge.
\par \tab \tab And in going directly to the efficacy, and again, this is just my notes from what was said, we're supposed to have a significant portion of the population and that this will provide clinically significant results.
\par \tab \tab And I don't think it's been demonstrated how these results are going to be used clinically, and therefore whether these results are clinically significant.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab And Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  And I voted against the motion.  Primarily it's based on a couple of things.  I recognize from looking through the 47 pounds of data that HPV presence and absence of cytological findings; imparts a significantly higher risk of cervical cancer.
\par \tab \tab Also, I really wish we would have had a well controlled, well designed study to prove the point, the extension of the application of this test, but that wasn't the case.
\par \tab \tab But even with that, in all the problems pointed out by both the sponsor and the FDA, the message still comes through that there is a significant contribution in terms of sensitivity with no real adverse effect on specificity of the HPV test when done in conjunction with PAP.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  And Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  I voted against the motion because if I understand the concerns expressed, and I've previously expressed some of my own, I think the overriding concern for me, you know, is cancer detection, and the studies done in a variety of settings were ending up all imperfect, but in a variety of settings have shown improvement in the negative predictive value and improvement or a demonstration I think we should say that the relative risk of the patients who have high risk HPV is -- the relative risk is higher for the patients who are high risk infected with high risk types, and so this will improve cancer detection.
\par \tab \tab I think, you know, there are a lot of issues that will arise out of doing this, and while I think the clinicians who spoke on behalf of the sponsor are ready for them and, you know, understanding what the issues are, I think there are a lot of clinicians out there who are not.  But that wouldn't justify voting to not approve the proposal.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you for your comments.
\par \tab \tab And at this point, the motion having been defeated, we will entertain further motions.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  I would like to move that it's approvable with conditions.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Second.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Well, you haven't heard my conditions yet.
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab MR. BERRY:  Maybe, Juan, you have conditions.  Would you like to do conditions?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  We need to hear the conditions first.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  I have two conditions.  First of all, I am persuaded in the efficacy of the test, and I think Dr. Lorincz's statement that the concordance of the various studies is absolutely correct.  I think this is a truly fine test.
\par \tab \tab The issue to me is the one that Dr. Reller stated, and I don't know whether the condition that I'm going to specify can be met.  I would like to see specific recommendations for using the test clinically, and I would like to see a demonstration that these recommendations will have an impact on clinical practice.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry, could you just repeat those for us so people can get this down?  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  I would like to see specific recommendations for using the test in clinical management, and I would like to see a demonstration that they will have an impact on clinical practice.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Gutman?
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Yeah.  I actually need some clarification on this.  Is this something that you are looking for before or after approval?  And is this something that you're looking for in terms of some kind of expert assessment, a clinical study, a maculating adventure or some other alternative?
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Well, I was not looking for expert opinion.  I was looking for an evidence based demonstration that could be, in part, or perhaps in whole, based on the information that they currently have.  For example, the longitudinal data analysis that we talked about this morning and the recommendation consistent with the conclusions of that longitudinal data analysis.
\par \tab \tab What I'm worried about is that this gets out into the world and nobody knows anything about how to do things.  Yes, you say you're going to education, but you know, being an educator from long past, I'm not too optimistic about the effects of telling people how they should do things.
\par \tab \tab I would like to see a specific indication, a specific recommendation that says if you, for example, if you prolong the interval -- and I'm not saying that this is part of the condition, but this is just an example -- if you prolong the interval for those patients who test -- for those women who test negative and you shorten the interval for those patients who test positive on HPV, that that will -- and some modeling based on data -- that will improve the management of patients, and I'm not looking for a randomized trial that will show cervical cancer mortality reduction or anything like that, but some evidence based demonstration that the recommendations that the claim is justified
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Durack, did you have a question?
\par \tab \tab DR. DURACK:  Mr. Chairman, is it permissible for a non-voting member to ask for a clarification on the wording of the conditions?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes, it is.
\par \tab \tab DR. DURACK:  Dr. Berry, I wonder if you would entertain instead of impact on clinical practice, positive impact on outcome of clinical interventions?
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Absolutely.  Thank you very much.  I would accept that.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Gutman?  How would\~\_-
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  You've just taken words away from him.  I'm not sure how to respond.
\par \tab \tab It's a daunting challenge to ask the -- I guess I'd be curious to hear if the company has ideas on how they might address this.
\par \tab \tab PARTICIPANT:  Are you looking for something now?
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Never mind.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  I think Dr. Gutman is just looking for clarity about how this would be achieved.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  It could be a post market study.  It could be data that they currently have.  It could be, you know, a new study.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Janosky?
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  I have a question for Dr. Gutman.  It seems like what this motion is asking is for us to do approvable with conditions.  Oh, by the way, the condition is come up with a clinical indication.  Is that what it is?
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Sort of, yeah.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  So you're saying you have a product, but you don't have a clinical indication.  Come up with one and then it's approvable.
\par \tab \tab I would think that this is not within the line of conditions that we typically attach to this type of motion.  Am I incorrect?
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  This is at the edge.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  That's what I thought.
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  So you're telling them to find another indication and then we'll prove it.  I would submit that it's a little bit further than the edge.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Reller, comment please?
\par \tab \tab Actually, no.  You may not comment in the vote.  sorry.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I am in full support of the conditions that Dr. Berry outlined, and Dr. Gutman delineated were at or beyond a condition as opposed to grounds for not approving with the data currently available.
\par \tab \tab In everything I've heard today, the PAP smear is what detected an abnormality that necessitated action.  There may be action that is necessitated by a positive HPV HC2 test.  That could be a repeat PAP smear at a certain interval.  It could be colposcopy at a certain interval.  It could be one of several things that would alter clinical practice based on a positive test.
\par \tab \tab But I have not heard nor seen the data to support the specific indications that are at the heart of what Dr. Berry would like to see before approvable.  If we had those, we may well have an approvable test.  It's just at ten minutes of four on the 8th of March 2002 I don't think we have that, and I think if we're going to get it, it would be a condition of approval which would be before approval, which would de facto put us back to we do not have an approvable test without further information.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  I'm sorry.  I think I'll disagree with what you said because, in fact, I think four of the eight studies presented data of an intervention that was not caused by the PAP.  In most of those studies a HPV positive resulted   in a colposcopy to detect the disease or it did not detect disease, but it was, in fact, a trigger for colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab Now, the company has chosen not to use that as an indication or has not chosen to use that as their algorithm for treatment suggestion, but there is data there that intervention due to HC2 positivity does detect disease.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Are you saying, Dr. Felix, that if you have an HPV positive test that a woman should have colposcopy?
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  No, I'm not saying that.  I just said you mentioned that there was no disease found other than with the PAP smear, and I was just correcting you.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Okay, but this is exactly the point.  Does an HPV positive test -- should it trigger colposcopy?  Should it trigger a repeat PAP smear?  What is the action that the practitioner is to take based on the HPV test positive?
\par \tab \tab That to me is the critical issue, and yes, I recognize that colposcopy in these studies found something that the PAP did not.  However, then the logical extension would be you have a positive; you do colposcopy.  But if you're not willing to go there, then where do we go?  
\par \tab \tab And I don't see the guidelines for what to do with the positive test.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  As neither a gynecologist or a pathologist, I find myself in the middle of these discussions all the time because it seems that you've got gynecologists not wanting the pathologists to give them recommendations for follow-up, and there's this whole debate about who should give the recommendations and what should be followed.
\par \tab \tab I don't see where this is any different than with an ASCUS or an out cell PAP (phonetic).  Depending on your patient population, there are decisions made about whether you're going to bring her in every four months, whether you're going to bring her in every six months or you're going to refer immediately to colposcopy.
\par \tab \tab I also have to question this issue of we don't have a clinical indication.  Either we decide CIN3 is something that's clinically important to detect or we throw out all cervical cancer screening, and you know, these data have suggested an increase sensitivity with a combined PAP and hybrid capture II testing for detecting CIN3.
\par \tab \tab Issues around who should get immediate colposcopy, who can wait for a year for a follow-up PAP, I think it seems reasonable at this point to leave that other discussion as to whether or not this indication is appropriate.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  This is a little bit of just a semantic comment, but there's been a question raised as to whether or not the company has provided sufficient or indicated what the appropriate indications were for the test is, and the indication, as I understand it from reading all of the material, is screening for cervical cancer along with the PAP smear in women age 30 and older.  You know, that's an indication.
\par \tab \tab What they haven't provided and what is admittedly a little bit problematic is what to do with the results, and in light of that is they've given some guidance, but that's really more the -- that role is more appropriately taken by the professional organization, and the pathologists and gynecologists, you know, should continue that argument as to when to do what.
\par \tab \tab But you know, I don't think it's necessarily their role to lay out the entire algorithm as to how the test result is to be used, although it might be helpful if they did that.  I don't think that should be a requirement of the company.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  We were having this discussion earlier about the previous indication for the test and its use in screening women, looking at women with ASCUS, and although that's an indication, I mean, the extent to which that indication is put into medical practice is variable at best.
\par \tab \tab And I keep coming back to the fact that I don't think it's reasonable to expect the sponsor to map out the clinical practice plan.  They've got clear indication now, and in practice that clear indication or that -- I'd be curious to see how many HPV tests are sold versus the number of cases of ASCUS that occur in this country, but I think you'd find that there are many practice settings that even that indication isn't adhered to with any regularity.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Any other comments?
\par \tab \tab I'd just like to restate the motion at this time so everyone knows exactly what we're talking about.
\par \tab \tab There's a motion for approvable with conditions, there being two conditions.  The first thing that there be provided specific recommendations for using the test clinically, the second being a demonstration that these recommendations will have a positive impact on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  The positive impact on clinical outcomes, are we back into preapproval, post marketing?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  I think that's an issue in Dr. Gutman's square.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Well, it's your -- we're looking for a recommendation from you.  That makes a difference to us and to the company.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  It was your condition.  What did you want it to be?
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Well, I'm open, but the intent was preapproval.
\par \tab \tab DR. DURACK:  Mr. Chairman.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes, Dr. Durack.
\par \tab \tab DR. DURACK:  May I just make a general comment?  As industry representative, I would like to give an opinion, which is that if we set conditions, we have to just be careful that they're not unduly burdensome or put the sponsor in a position where they would like to meet the conditions, but are unable to for some reason beyond their control, such as  ACOG.
\par \tab \tab I just put that on the table, without agreeing or disagreeing with any of the points that we're voting.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Good point.  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Gutman, what are the general mechanisms that would allow FDA to work with the sponsor to try to accommodate these recommendations?
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Well, the reason I'm trying to reach clarity is that if you are really pushing for a study that would be at all broad in scope for evidence based demonstration of recommendations and, frankly, positive impact on outcomes.  We would be putting a very challenging task both before the agency and before the company.
\par \tab \tab I'm thinking about our clock actually and the fact that maybe that would require a new prospective study or something.
\par \tab \tab If we're talking about piecing together language  or arguing over language and trying to get the company to provide some evidence of some modeling or drawing back from the claim actually, not strengthening the algorithm, but that's weakening it and just putting what's there and what's not there.  That's something we could probably negotiate in real time with the company.  It might be awfully bloody, but we could probably do it.
\par \tab \tab And there are all kinds of choices in between, but my preference would be to do less rather than more if you make it a preapproval because time clicks for both us and the companies, which can make a high hurdle.  That's going to be a problem for me personally.  I'll do whatever you would advice or at least I'll consider whatever you advise.
\par \tab \tab And if you make it post market, I don't want to over sell the strength of that not only because of ACOG, but just because of challenges of the nuances of practice and the law and the regulations and the company's interest.  It's challenging to gather information post market, but both are possible.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  But, Dr. Gutman, does it meet the spirit of the process at this point to require up front data on positive clinical outcomes?  Because, in effect, it's almost a resubmission.
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  Yeah, it does impact, sure.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  We have a motion for approvable with conditions.
\par \tab \tab Yeah, go ahead.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  I don't know what can be considered a condition.  So I suggest these here if they're inappropriate.
\par \tab \tab One would be a condition that there is educational materials to go along with the tests, and if there's some way that it can be distributed to the users and not just to the labs.
\par \tab \tab And the second is -- and I guess this is where I would see the need for more information on clinical use and clinical outcomes, is to do some post marketing surveillance on how the test is being used and what impact it has on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Let me summarize then the current motion on the table is for approvable with conditions, now being four conditions.
\par \tab \tab First is specific recommendations for using the test clinically.
\par \tab \tab The second is a demonstration that those recommendations will have a positive impact on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab The third recommendation is that education materials, the company would test both in -- our educational materials both in the laboratories and for users.
\par \tab \tab And the fourth recommendation would be that there be post marketing surveillance to assess the impact on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Reller?
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I think the first two conditions that you mentioned or clarify if that's Dr. Berry's intent that those were premarketing.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Is that correct, Dr. Berry?
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Are there any further comments or questions, points that need to be clarified?
\par \tab \tab Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Yeah, the point I brought up earlier in terms of the semi-quantitative aspect of this test and the concerns I have about should this test become widely applied to the 55 million or so PAP smears that are going to be done on women that have those PAP smears.
\par \tab \tab The issues about the way that the test is designed with a single sort of cutoff point may intensify problems, low positives, false positives, whatever you want to call them, that the company if they have the data in terms of the readout, the relative light unit data, to see if there's anything that could be done to establish a gray zone or a situation that might prevent calling low level positives positive when, in fact, they are negative.
\par \tab \tab In this test, the cutoff is 342 and the value is 341.  It's a negative.  If it's 343, it's a positive, and that's okay, I think, with the current application because you're enriching the patients you test for the ones that have the disease.
\par \tab \tab But now if this goes through, and we're talking about it as a screening test, I'm really uncomfortable with the assay design or at least the interpretation of the assay.
\par \tab \tab So I'd like to talk about that as a condition for approval.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  I would like to just state I agree with the other Panel member who spoke about the need for educational material as far as clinicians and patients.  I'm sure if it goes through, the company is going to at the very least attempt to educate the labs just as a part of marketing, but it's important for the clinicians to be educated as to the implications of HPV positive, PAP negative patients.
\par \tab \tab And that's walking a fine line because, as I said earlier, not going back on what I said, but it's not the company's role to actually develop guidelines.  This is something new and, you know, fraught with potential problems in terms of its social implications.
\par \tab \tab And, you know, I don't think that can be overstated.  It's not as important as preventing cancer, again, but it is very important and, you know, I don't think it would be a good thing to under estimate the importance of that.
\par \tab \tab So education is important, and in the absence of -- hopefully the professional societies would pick up the ball and, you know, develop some more specific guidelines, but in their absence at least some suggestion as to how the various possible outcomes of this proposal, of the proposed test would be used, I think, would be helpful.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  I just wanted to comment on the question about roles and about -- perhaps can Digene comment on this?
\par \tab \tab All right.  Limit to my experience.
\par \tab \tab I think for a lot of infectious diseases, you know, certainly the amount of virus demonstrated is very important in the disease causation.  Probably for the infection and maybe early on in establishing an SIL level is important, but I think the data pretty much show within the range of what we can look at quantitatively, it doesn't appear to be important with salient free and cancers.
\par \tab \tab But that's not giving you what you might want because probably you just need a small group of about one cell infected.  That least to, you know, a clone that becomes cancer.  So it's not that quantitative information doesn't appear to be useful.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  And I understand that, and I understand from the literature that was in the packet that there's not a tight correlation between disease state and viral load, if you will.
\par \tab \tab And there are all sorts of problems, as Dr. Unger pointed out, in terms of using this test in a quantitative  fashion.  There's no denominator essentially.  It's all dependent upon the amount of cellular material you get.
\par \tab \tab But what I am concerned about is those values that hover around the cutoff in this asset, and I'm wondering whether a look at the large data set that they have might help define an area that's recalling the question, some of the positive results.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Durack.
\par \tab \tab DR. DURACK:  I'd just like to reinforce briefly for the sake of clarity that the requirement to demonstrate a positive impact on clinical outcomes would require a very long study, certainly a long study.
\par \tab \tab And in view of the number of years that might be required, it might be considered unduly burdensome.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  May I comment?  I wasn't thinking of a long-term study.  I was thinking mostly of a reanalysis of the data that they have, especially the longitudinal data.  There could be some modeling of things that we know about the disease and detection of the disease.
\par \tab \tab I wasn't thinking of a long-term study.  Whether they can do it on the basis of the data that they have is another matter.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.  I'd like to at this point review the motion that's on the table.  this is for a motion of approval with conditions and, I think, five conditions.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  May I just -- the fifth condition, I think, could be subsumed into the demonstration or into how to use the test.  So if we interpret the test broadly, I think that would accommodate Dr. Nolte's point.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Nolte, are you willing to accept that?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  I'm not sure I'm following what you're saying.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Well, the first condition that I had was using the test, that they should tell us how we should use the test, and interpreting that broadly, if the test is just a little bit above the cutoff or a little bit below the cutoff, then that's something that they should address.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Fine.  I mean --
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  See, I'm a little bit worried about, you know, having lots of conditions and then people voting against because there are so many conditions.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  A procedural question.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Do we vote on each individual?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  No, we vote on the motion.  We have to agree on what the recommendations will be.  Then we would need a second, and then we vote on the full motion.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  So, Dr. Nolte, are you agreeable to what was suggested?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Sure, as long we're clear about that the quantitative aspects, semi-quantitative aspect of this assay needs to be examined.  The data needs to be examined to see if there's any way to improve the specificity as it's applied to allow prevalent populations.  That's my point.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  So let me repeat then.  The motion is for approval with conditions, there being the first condition, specific recommendations for using the test clinically, and this would include Dr. Nolte's concerns about the interpretive criteria for the gray zone;
\par \tab \tab The second recommendation being a demonstration that these recommendations will have a positive impact on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab The third recommendation is that educational materials accompany the test, and these are both laboratory as well as clinical users.
\par \tab \tab And the fourth recommendation is that post marketing surveillance be undertaken that would have an assessment on the impact on outcomes.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  We have a motion  for approval with conditions.  I do not yet have a second on that motion.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Reller?
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I will second it, but I want to make sure that we understand that at least the first two are premarketing.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I'll second that motion.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Good.  Then we'll vote on that.  Then we'll come back to the individual recommendations and go around the table again.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Reller?
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab PARTICIPANT:  Excuse me.  Don --
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab PARTICIPANT:  -- here, Deputy Division Director.
\par \tab \tab I think you need to vote on each of the conditions first and then make a final vote on all of them.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  that's fine.  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Let's go around then on the first.  It's the premarket recommendation that there be specific recommendations for using the test clinically.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry?
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky?
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Nolte?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  And Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  We have a tie vote, four to four.  I'm just doing the tally.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  We do have a tie vote.  It's four to four, which leaves the tie breaking vote to me as the Panel Chair.  I'm going to vote yet.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  The second recommendation is, again, a premarket recommendation that the specific recommendations for using the test clinically demonstrate that the recommendations will have a positive impact on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab And we'll go around again, starting with Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I will vote yes to this, but I think that there would be considerable work, exactly what we mean by positive outcome.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  And Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  Again, we have a tie vote.
\par \tab \tab (Laughter.)
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:   Leaving the tie breaking vote to me once again, and on this one I'm going to vote yes as well.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  The third recommendation is that educational materials accompany the test or at least be available both to the laboratories, as well as the clinical users of the test.
\par \tab \tab Once again starting with Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  And Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  That motion passed.  It carried unanimously.
\par \tab \tab Given the last recommendation is that post marketing surveillance be undertaken that will assess the impact of the clinical outcomes, on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab We'll begin with Dr. Reller again.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  And Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  I'm going to say yes.  I'm mixed on that one actually.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  That passes.  That part of the motion carries by six to two.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Okay.  That last vote, I think a lot of people voted in a vacuum.  So the panelists have approved now premarket approved that it's going to be effective, as well as post market surveillance?  is that the intention of the panel, that both be --
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  We have approved --
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  -- put upon the company?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  -- the individual recommendations, but we have yet to put all of those together under the overall motion, to vote on that.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  Okay.  I see.  I guess everybody was aware that --
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Right.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  -- both of those existed.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Right.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Just to clarify, my impression was that the original -- that the first showing that it will have an impact on clinical outcome was the premarket, the preapproval was based on data.  The actual impact on clinical practice may vary substantially from that, and my understanding of the motion was to survey that, to see what it was.
\par \tab \tab Laura, is that right?
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  Right.  That one success is being used, that you get an understanding that it's up to the company to provide some information on how it's being used, what effect it's having on clinical practice and outcomes.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Right.  So it's not at all contradictory.  They're actually supportive of each other.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  So at this point then the motion is on the table.  It's for approvable with conditions, with the four conditions we just voted on.  So we have a motion.  I need a second on that motion.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I'll second the motion.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  We have a motion and a second.  Is there any further discussion or does anyone need any other points clarified?
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Would you restate the conditions, please?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  I will restate the motion with the conditions.
\par \tab \tab The motion is approvable with conditions, there being four conditions.
\par \tab \tab The first of these is that there be on a premarket basis specific recommendations for using the test clinically.
\par \tab \tab The second condition, again, on a premarket basis, that there be a demonstration that these recommendations will have a positive impact on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab The third conditions is that education materials accompany the test, materials to be provided both to the laboratories as well as clinical users.
\par \tab \tab And the fourth recommendation is that there be post marketing surveillance to assess the impact on clinical outcomes.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  Can I ask for a clarification on the condition, the premarket condition, the positive impact on clinical outcomes?  Is that to be an additional study or based on analysis of already existing data?
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  I think as Dr. Gutman has stated, that that's something that the FDA can work on as to what the best approach is.
\par \tab \tab Steve, do you have any specific comments on that?
\par \tab \tab DR. GUTMAN:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Okay.  So we have a motion and a second.  I'd like to take the vote at this time.  We'll begin again with Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  Yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  And Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  No.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  The motion then carries by a vote of six to two.
\par \tab \tab At this point I'd like to go around and ask each of the panel members once again to state their reasoning and the thoughts behind their vote.
\par \tab \tab We'll begin with Dr. Reller.
\par \tab \tab DR. RELLER:  I think we have an approved good test for the detection of HPV DNA.  How to use that appropriately in actual practice in conjunction with the PAP smear we do not have now, and I think we need it to use the test safety and effectively in patients who could potentially benefit.
\par \tab \tab And until those things are delineated in these conditions, I do not think the test should be approved.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Berry.
\par \tab \tab DR. BERRY:  I have nothing further to add.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Janosky.
\par \tab \tab DR. JANOSKY:  It's my understanding is that we were to vote on safety and effectiveness for the indication for use, and it seems like what we voted on was safety and effectiveness, but not for any specific indication for use.
\par \tab \tab Whether you call that a not approvable or approvable with these conditions that we had outlined, that doesn't seem to clear to me.  So I can safely say that I voted on safety and effectiveness, but no specific indication for use.  Hopefully those premarketing studies will tell us what those indications really should be.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Felix.
\par \tab \tab DR. FELIX:  I voted no because I could not agree with the conditions of the approval.  I could not disagree with the data presented for women age over 40 as an indication.  So that the first condition was providing an indication for use in screening in women over 30.  I felt that that was a -- that they had proven that and think that both a premarket and a post market study are unduly burdensome on the sponsor.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Koutsky.
\par \tab \tab DR. KOUTSKY:  I voted yes because I think the educational materials and the post marketing surveillance and impact of outcomes are important, and that I can see that there are clinicians on the panel, that there was an interest in having specific recommendations made by Digene.  I do have a problem with the premarketing additional information that was requested.  I'm sure that the FDA and Digene can work that out.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Dr. Beavis.
\par \tab \tab DR. BEAVIS:  I voted in favor of the motion because I wanted to make sure that the way this test would be used is outlined before it hits the market.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Dr. Nolte.
\par \tab \tab DR. NOLTE:  I voted in favor of the resolution.  I guess I'm learning how to play politics.  Most of the amendments, I think, are a little burdensome, but I think basically the test has value, and I'd like to see it get out there for that purpose.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab And Dr. Birdsong.
\par \tab \tab DR. BIRDSONG:  I may be learning to play politics a little bit also, but I voted against it for a reason similar to Dr. Felix.  I think the condition for premarket demonstration of effectiveness is not necessary, and specifically I don't think it belongs there, and were that condition not there, I would have voted yes.
\par \tab \tab And second, you know, as I stated earlier, I think the stated indication of screening for cervical cancer in women over 30, screening is an indication, and I think that's stated clearly, and it doesn't need further modification.
\par \tab \tab CHAIRMAN WILSON:  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab As I did register two votes on the recommendations, I'm obliged as well to comment on my thinking.
\par \tab \tab I  concur with the comments of Drs. Reller and Berry in that I believe that there needs to be very clear specificity about what a clinician on the first line is going to do with one of these test results, even in the absence of guidelines from ACOG or what other body is out there.
\par \tab \tab There needs to be specific clinical guidelines that providers that get a result know what to do with those results.
\par \tab \tab Okay.  That concludes the business today.  I would like to thank all of the members of the panel who traveled here today, regular panel members as well as consultants and guests.
\par \tab \tab I'd also like to thank Digene for their presentation, as well as the FDA.
\par \tab \tab Thank you, and the meeting is adjourned.
\par \tab \tab (Whereupon, at 4:23 p.m., the Panel meeting was concluded.)
