                         NOTICE OF UNLICENSED OPERATION

   Case Number: EB-08-NY-026

   Document Number: W20083238025

   The New York Office received information that an unlicensed broadcast
   radio station on 88.5 MHz was allegedly operating in Brooklyn, NY. On
   January 26 and January 27, 2008, an agent from this office confirmed by
   direction finding techniques that radio signals on frequency 88.5 MHz were
   emanating from 536 Empire Blvd., Brooklyn, NY 11225. The Commission's
   records show that no license was issued for operation of a broadcast
   station on 88.5 MHz at this location in Brooklyn, NY.

   Radio stations must be licensed by the FCC pursuant to 47 U.S.C. S: 301.
   The only exception to this licensing requirement is for certain
   transmitters using or operating at a power level or mode of operation that
   complies with the standards established in Part 15 of the Commission's
   rules, 47 C.F.R. S:S:  15.1 et seq. The field strength of the signal on
   frequency 88.5 MHz was measured at 6,341 microvolts per meter (uV/m) at
   718 meters, which exceeded the maximum permitted level of 250 uV/m at 3
   meters for non-licensed devices. Thus, this station is operating in
   violation of 47 U.S.C. S: 301.

   You are hereby warned that operation of radio transmitting equipment
   without a valid radio station authorization constitutes a violation of the
   Federal laws cited above and could subject the operator to severe
   penalties, including, but not limited to, substantial monetary fines, in
   rem arrest action against the offending radio equipment, and criminal
   sanctions including imprisonment. (see 47 U.S.C. S:S: 401, 501, 503 and
   510).

   UNLICENSED OPERATION OF THIS RADIO STATION MUST BE DISCONTINUED
   IMMEDIATELY.

   You have ten (10) days from the date of this notice to respond with any
   evidence that you have authority to operate granted by the FCC. Your
   response should be sent to the address in the letterhead and reference the
   listed case and document number. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.
   S: 552a(e)(3), we are informing you that the Commission's staff will use
   all relevant material information before it to determine what, if any,
   enforcement action is required to ensure your compliance with FCC Rules.
   This will include any information that you disclose in your reply.

   You may contact this office if you have any questions.

   Daniel W. Noel

   District Director

   New York Office
