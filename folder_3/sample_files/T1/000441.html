<strong>Felix Graham</strong></a> probably was born before 1740. In March 1762, a legal <a href="../../guide/histres.html#later">doc</a>ument called him a "merchant of Albany."

<p>In 1766, an Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment roll</a> taxed his assets substantially - placing him clearly in the top five percent of the community. However, his presence in Albany during the 1760s made only the slightest impression the <a href="../../cbr.html">comm</a>unity record.

<p>During the 1770s, he was <a href="http://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/p797.html">said</a> to have been the partner of <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=36737">Peter Pond</a> - a trader and adventurer of the Old Northwest. It appears that Graham brought trade goods from New York to the Great Lakes where Pond moved them to regional customers.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war years</a>, his name has not been found in New York sources. Also, no family connections are apparent to any of the prominent Graham <a href="../../inprog.html">families</a> of Albany and greater New York.


<p>He <a href="http://www.alexautographs.com/l-colrev.htm">seems</a> to have been a Montreal-based merchant at the end of the War for Independence. In 1785, he was identified as "of Montreal" when he joined in a petition to the provincial Assembly  regarding his boatload of sugar that was carried away by river rapids.


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the first Federal census for Saratoga identified Felix Graham as the head of a household with a total of five inhabitants.


<p>Felix Graham is <a href="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:4hPAt_Btwu4J:archive.lib.msu.edu/MMM/JA/09/a/JA09a001p012.pdf+%22felix+graham%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=87&gl=us&lr=lang_en">said</a> to have died before 1794 and to have left a widow.</p>
