                          ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION



      The papers of Felix Frankfurter (1882-1965), law professor,
author, and associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States, were deeded to the Library of Congress in 1955 by
Frankfurter.  The Library received the papers from 1967 to 1969. 
Additions have been made through gift, purchase, and transfer
between 1971 and 1990.

      In 1970, Anita Nolen organized the Frankfurter Papers and
prepared a register published by the Library in 1971.  In 1972,
certain items in the papers were discovered to be missing. 
Subsequently, some of the missing material was recovered in
photocopied form.  These items, marked with an X for identification
purposes, have been incorporated into the papers in place of the
originals.  Other items known to be missing and not represented by
photocopies are listed in the Appendix to this register. 
Additional information can be found in the Library's brochure
"Material Missing from the Felix Frankfurter Papers."

      In 1983, additions to the Frankfurter Papers through that year
were appended to the papers as a final series, and the papers and
a revised published edition of the register entitled _Felix
Frankfurter: A Register of His Papers in the Library of Congress_,
were prepared for microfilming.  Other additions to the papers
since 1983 comprise the 1997 addition and have not been
microfilmed.

      Copyright in the unpublished writings of Felix Frankfurter in
these papers and in other collections of papers in the custody of
the Library of Congress has been dedicated to the public.

      The microfilm edition of the Frankfurter Papers is available
on 165 reels from the Library's Photoduplication Service for
purchase subject to the Copyright Law of the United States (Title
17, U.S.C.).  The microfilm may also be requested on interlibrary
loan through the Library's Loan Division.  Ten reels may be
requested at a time for a loan period of one month.

                            SCOPE AND CONTENT NOTE



      The papers of Felix Frankfurter cover the period from 1846 to
1966, although the bulk of the material begins in 1907.  This
collection, which Frankfurter considered to be his personal papers,
is supplemented by his Supreme Court files which he gave to the Law
School of Harvard University, his correspondence relating to the
Sacco-Vanzetti case, also at Harvard, and documents relating to the
Zionist movement, which are at the Hebrew University in Israel. 
The Manuscript Division has a microfilm copy of the Zionist
documents, some of the Sacco-Vanzetti material, and the Harvard Law
School collection.  In addition, a considerable amount of material
relating to the Supreme Court, for the most part in photocopied
form, is scattered throughout the Library's collection of personal
papers.

      The Frankfurter Papers consist of diaries, correspondence,
subject files, a speech, article, and book file, a legal file, and
miscellaneous material.  Also included are papers of William Henry
Moody (1853-1917), United States attorney general and associate
justice of the United States Supreme Court.  Frankfurter's
involvement with significant political and social movements and
events and his acquaintance with leaders in many segments of
society make his papers a rich source for the study of a variety of
topics.  The complex character of the man and the general feeling
of the times--the Zeitgeist, as he called it--are illuminated
through a study of his papers.

      In his correspondence, Frankfurter was as likely to expound
his philosophy of life and law to a graduate student or an aspiring
author as to a distinguished and cherished friend, a fact which
makes the correspondence series particularly important.  Dean
Acheson, Charles C. Burlingham, Frank W. Buxton, Alfred E. Cohn,
Herbert David Croly, Herbert Feis, Jerome Frank, Henry J. Friendly,
Learned Hand, W. S. Lewis, Max Lowenthal, Archibald MacLeish,
Reinhold Niebuhr, and Franklin D. Roosevelt are representative of
his numerous correspondents in the General Correspondence series. 
For his early years as a lawyer in the public service, the
correspondence with Emory R. Buckner, beginning in 1907, and Henry
Lewis Stimson, beginning in 1908, is probably the most substantive.

      Letters from the British economist Harold Joseph Laski provide
many comments on British and American politics during the period
1915-1950.  Few copies of Frankfurter's letters to Lasky are
included in the collection, indicating that most of these were
probably handwritten items of which he kept no copy.  A similar
situation exists in Frankfurter's correspondence with Louis Dembitz
Brandeis.  Frankfurter once wrote that "the correspondence between
him [Brandeis] and me was--with very few exceptions--in longhand on
both sides.  I made no copies--not even a notation--of my letters
to him" (letter to A. T. Mason, 18 June, 1943).  In the collection,
Frankfurter's letters to Brandeis exist exclusively in the form of
photocopies.  The correspondence itself is a rich source for study
of the judicial process, and particularly of the Supreme Court,
since Frankfurter was one of the few people off the court with whom
Brandeis discussed court matters.  The Brandeis file also contains
a few letters to Brandeis from Samuel D. Warren, Jr., 1878-1879,
concerning their proposed law partnership in Boston.

      Frankfurter's correspondence with his wife, Marion Denman,
both before and after their marriage, is also a significant portion
of the collection.  Long letters to each other record their
personal feelings and philosophies and comment on the people and
events they observed.  Frankfurter's letters from Paris in 1919
give perhaps his only account of the people and events he
encountered as a member of the Zionist Commission at the peace
conference.

      Significant letters can also be found in the Special
Correspondence series, the organization of which as a separate
entity reflects the organization of Frankfurter's files.  The
Oxford correspondence is essentially general correspondence for the
period 1933-1934 when Frankfurter was George Eastman visiting
professor at Oxford University.  Many of the letters he received at
the time he declined the appointment to the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court and upon his appointment to and retirement from the
Supreme Court are more than merely congratulatory notes.

      Subject files in the Frankfurter Papers are as important as
the personal correspondence.  They are especially relevant for
those interested in the development of legal and social
institutions.  Compiled for the most part during his years at the
Harvard Law School, they reflect the exercise of his talents and
influence beyond the confines of the classroom.  Significant and
related files exist for the American Law Institute, the American
Civil Liberties Union, the Cleveland Foundation, the Harvard crime
survey in Boston, the National Consumers' League, the National
Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, known as the United
States Wickersham Commission, and the Social Science Research
Council.

      For an analysis of the relation between law and social action,
files on independent regulatory commissions and industrial
relations are informative.  The files of the War Labor Policies
Board and those concerning the Mooney case tell something of
Frankfurter's activities during World War I when he took leave from
his Harvard professorship to work in Washington.  Also of interest
are the files concerning Oliver Wendell Holmes in which
correspondence of Holmes's law clerks for the years 1929-1935 tell
of the justice's last years.

      As an unofficial adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt even before
Roosevelt's presidency, Frankfurter was intimately involved with
the New Deal from its inception.  Subject files on banking
reorganization, the National Industrial Recovery Act, public
utilities, railroad reorganization, labor injunctions,
unemployment, and the Supreme Court document the Frankfurter-
Roosevelt correspondence.

      The Frankfurter Papers are also of value for literary
historians.  Frankfurter once wrote, "When all is said letter
writing is the most abidingly fascinating literary form" (letter to
his wife, 3 October 1922), and it was a form in which he certainly
excelled.  Indeed, the whole collection is a superb example of the
art of belles lettres, as can be seen in Frankfurter's
correspondence with Francis Hackett, author, literary critic, and
an early editor of the _New Republic._  Spanning the period from
1918 to 1964, this exchange yields much critical information on the
literary world and its personages in the period between the two
world wars.

      As one of the original group influential in founding the _New
Republic_ in 1914, Frankfurter was for many years a trustee of the
journal and a regular contributor to its columns.  Copies of many
of these contributions can be found in the Speech, Article, and
Book File, which contains seven bound volumes housing a nearly
complete set of Frankfurter's speeches and published articles. 
Also in this series are oral history interviews begun for the
Columbia University Oral History Project and eventually published
as _Felix Frankfurter Reminisces._  The many letters he received
after its publication are in the Special Correspondence File.

      Not to be overlooked is the Miscellany series, which includes
research notes, memoranda, biographical material, copies of
favorite quotations, and typed copies of a Civil War diary and
correspondence of Holmes.  A memorandum of conversations with
Brandeis records commentary on Supreme Court personalities and
their judicial philosophies.

      The final series in the collection, Addenda, consists of two
additions acquired by the Library from 1971 to 1990.  The 1983
addition includes letters from Frankfurter to his sisters Ella
Frankfurter Rogers and Estelle S. Frankfurter along with letters
exchanged between the sisters and related items; correspondence,
reports, memoranda, clippings, and printed matter, relating to
Franklin D. Roosevelt; correspondence with Loring Christie, Albert
Einstein, Albert M. Friedenberg, and Eleanor Roosevelt; and a
memoir, "Chum Felix Frankfurter," by Frank W. Buxton.

      The 1997 addition consists of correspondence between
Frankfurter and Julian Huxley and Archibald MacLeish and an
annotated copy of Frankfurter's book, _The Case of Sacco and
Vanzetti: A Critical Analysis for Lawyers and Laymen_.  The
MacLeish letter contains an attached memorandum of a conversation
with Franklin D. Roosevelt and a typed copy of a memorandum from
Roosevelt to "F.A.D." (probably Fred Delano) relating to
Roosevelt's thoughts concerning future memorials dedicated to him. 
The Sacco and Vanzetti book contains typewritten and handwritten
annotations by Frankfurter.  Notes and printed matter about the
Sacco and Vanzetti case and other cases removed by Library staff
from the volume for preservation reasons are filed with the volume.

      Papers of William Henry Moody (1885-1917), associate justice
of the Supreme Court from 1906 to 1910, that came with the
Frankfurter Papers have been retained as part of the collection. 
They consist mainly of personal letters received by Moody during
the period 1906-1916 and complement the larger collection of
William H. Moody Papers in the Manuscript Division. Correspondents
include Ira A. Abbott, Robert S. Bradley, William A. Day, A. T.
Mahan, and Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919).
