        				<ol>
<li><strong>What kind of housing assistance will FEMA be providing to eligible disaster victims?</strong><br />
As a policy, FEMA will provide financial assistance (e.g. rental assistance) as the preferred means for housing assistance.&nbsp; When rental resources are lacking, FEMA will look to alternative types of temporary housing units for use in disasters.&nbsp; Manufactured housing (e.g. mobile homes), the construction of which is regulated by HUD and which is designed for long-term habitation, will continue to be installed in support of and occupied by eligible disaster victims.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>Which disaster areas will have housing units deployed?<br />
</strong>Those states with an open disaster declaration who have or will employ direct housing initiatives.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>What type of temporary housing units will FEMA be providing?</strong><br />
Until FEMA receives final results and recommendations of the research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), no recreational vehicle (travel trailer or park model) currently in FEMA's inventory will be installed or newly occupied.<br />
<br />
FEMA will provide manufactured housing (e.g. mobile home) for eligible disaster victims in need of temporary housing.&nbsp; The construction of manufactured housing is regulated by HUD, meets or exceeds industry standards and is designed for long-term habitation.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>Why isn't FEMA providing travel trailers in disaster housing operations?</strong><br />
Recreational vehicles are NOT regulated by HUD, since this form of accommodation is designed for short, temporary habitation, not housing.&nbsp; Accordingly, FEMA will not continue to offer recreational vehicles as a temporary housing option until it has an opportunity to review the final results and recommendations of the research conducted by the CDC.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>Is FEMA concerned about formaldehyde in manufactured housing?</strong><br />
Manufactured housing construction is regulated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), since this form of housing is designed for long-term habitation.&nbsp; Millions of Americans live in manufactured housing across the nation.&nbsp; HUD regulations include provisions which limit the amount of formaldehyde used in construction.&nbsp; Accordingly, FEMA will continue to utilize and offer manufactured housing that meets or exceeds industry standards, as a temporary housing option.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>What are my options if I currently reside in a FEMA-provided travel trailer or park model and have concerns about formaldehyde?</strong><br />
Current occupants of a FEMA-provided travel trailer or park model who are concerned about formaldehyde are encouraged to call our toll-free number 1-866-562-2381 (TTY 1-800-462-7585).&nbsp; FEMA will work with occupants on a case by case basis to identify alternative housing options.&nbsp; For instance, FEMA may authorize rental assistance when resources are available.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>What kind of formaldehyde testing will be done?</strong><br />
Industrial hygienists, epidemiologists, medical toxicologists and environmental health scientists from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and DHS's Office of Health Affairs have deployed to Louisiana and Mississippi to gather data and review measurements that consider relative humidity, trailer design and use by residents that will allow them to develop a more comprehensive study.&nbsp; The experts have been asked to identify an acceptable air quality level of formaldehyde in temporary housing units and develop a plan for testing.&nbsp; This review will also consider air quality conditions in travel trailers when they are used for prolonged periods under real-life conditions and identify means to reduce indoor air levels of formaldehyde to acceptable levels.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>If requested, will FEMA conduct air testing on travel trailers or park models?</strong><br />
FEMA will not conduct by-request air quality tests of temporary housing units.&nbsp; However, state and local governments, and occupants, are authorized to independently conduct air quality tests of FEMA temporary housing units, on a non-reimbursable basis.<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>Will FEMA continue its sales and donations of FEMA units?<br />
</strong>Any type of manufactured housing; which meets or exceeds industry standards; and which is designed for long-term habitation, may continue to be sold, transferred, or donated to any qualified individual or entity.<br />
<br />
Until FEMA has received the CDC's final results and recommendations, no recreational vehicle (travel trailer or park model) currently in FEMA's inventory will be sold, excessed, transferred, or donated to any individual or entity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>What is FEMA doing for those who have already purchased a travel trailer or park model and are concerned about formaldehyde?</strong><br />
For units that were sold, transferred, excessed, or donated prior to July 31, 2007, but remain under FEMA control (e.g., a buyer has paid for but not yet retrieved the unit from a FEMA storage location), the transaction will be allowed to continue, at the discretion of the unit recipient.</li>
