    Sec. 1131. National Wilderness Preservation System

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment; Congressional declaration of policy; wilderness
      areas; administration for public use and enjoyment, protection,
      preservation, and gathering and dissemination of information;
      provisions for designation as wilderness areas
      In order to assure that an increasing population, accompanied by
    expanding settlement and growing mechanization, does not occupy and
    modify all areas within the United States and its possessions,
    leaving no lands designated for preservation and protection in
    their natural condition, it is hereby declared to be the policy of
    the Congress to secure for the American people of present and
    future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of
    wilderness. For this purpose there is hereby established a National
    Wilderness Preservation System to be composed of federally owned
    areas designated by Congress as "wilderness areas", and these shall
    be administered for the use and enjoyment of the American people in
    such manner as will leave them unimpaired for future use and
    enjoyment as wilderness, and so as to provide for the protection of
    these areas, the preservation of their wilderness character, and
    for the gathering and dissemination of information regarding their
    use and enjoyment as wilderness; and no Federal lands shall be
    designated as "wilderness areas" except as provided for in this
    chapter or by a subsequent Act.
    (b) Management of area included in System; appropriations
      The inclusion of an area in the National Wilderness Preservation
    System notwithstanding, the area shall continue to be managed by
    the Department and agency having jurisdiction thereover immediately
    before its inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System
    unless otherwise provided by Act of Congress. No appropriation
    shall be available for the payment of expenses or salaries for the
    administration of the National Wilderness Preservation System as a
    separate unit nor shall any appropriations be available for
    additional personnel stated as being required solely for the
    purpose of managing or administering areas solely because they are
    included within the National Wilderness Preservation System.
    (c) "Wilderness" defined
      A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own
    works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where
    the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where
    man himself is a visitor who does not remain. An area of wilderness
    is further defined to mean in this chapter an area of
    underdeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and
    influence, without permanent improvements or human habitation,
    which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural
    conditions and which (1) generally appears to have been affected
    primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work
    substantially unnoticeable; (2) has outstanding opportunities for
    solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation; (3) has
    at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to
    make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired
    condition; and (4) may also contain ecological, geological, or
    other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical
    value.

    Sec. 1132. Extent of System

-STATUTE-
    (a) Designation of wilderness areas; filing of maps and
      descriptions with Congressional committees; correction of errors;
      public records; availability of records in regional offices
      All areas within the national forests classified at least 30 days
    before September 3, 1964 by the Secretary of Agriculture or the
    Chief of the Forest Service as "wilderness", "wild", or "canoe" are
    hereby designated as wilderness areas. The Secretary of Agriculture
    shall - 
        (1) Within one year after September 3, 1964, file a map and
      legal description of each wilderness area with the Interior and
      Insular Affairs Committees of the United States Senate and the
      House of Representatives, and such descriptions shall have the
      same force and effect as if included in this chapter: Provided,
      however, That correction of clerical and typographical errors in
      such legal descriptions and maps may be made.
        (2) Maintain, available to the public, records pertaining to
      said wilderness areas, including maps and legal descriptions,
      copies of regulations governing them, copies of public notices
      of, and reports submitted to Congress regarding pending
      additions, eliminations, or modifications. Maps, legal
      descriptions, and regulations pertaining to wilderness areas
      within their respective jurisdictions also shall be available to
      the public in the offices of regional foresters, national forest
      supervisors, and forest rangers.
    (b) Review by Secretary of Agriculture of classifications as
      primitive areas; Presidential recommendations to Congress;
      approval of Congress; size of primitive areas; Gore Range-Eagles
      Nest Primitive Area, Colorado
      The Secretary of Agriculture shall, within ten years after
    September 3, 1964, review, as to its suitability or nonsuitability
    for preservation as wilderness, each area in the national forests
    classified on September 3, 1964 by the Secretary of Agriculture or
    the Chief of the Forest Service as "primitive" and report his
    findings to the President. The President shall advise the United
    States Senate and House of Representatives of his recommendations
    with respect to the designation as "wilderness" or other
    reclassification of each area on which review has been completed,
    together with maps and a definition of boundaries. Such advice
    shall be given with respect to not less than one-third of all the
    areas now classified as "primitive" within three years after
    September 3, 1964, not less than two-thirds within seven years
    after September 3, 1964, and the remaining areas within ten years
    after September 3, 1964. Each recommendation of the President for
    designation as "wilderness" shall become effective only if so
    provided by an Act of Congress. Areas classified as "primitive" on
    September 3, 1964 shall continue to be administered under the rules
    and regulations affecting such areas on September 3, 1964 until
    Congress has determined otherwise. Any such area may be increased
    in size by the President at the time he submits his recommendations
    to the Congress by not more than five thousand acres with no more
    than one thousand two hundred and eighty acres of such increase in
    any one compact unit; if it is proposed to increase the size of any
    such area by more than five thousand acres or by more than one
    thousand two hundred and eighty acres in any one compact unit the
    increase in size shall not become effective until acted upon by
    Congress. Nothing herein contained shall limit the President in
    proposing, as part of his recommendations to Congress, the
    alteration of existing boundaries of primitive areas or
    recommending the addition of any contiguous area of national forest
    lands predominantly of wilderness value. Notwithstanding any other
    provisions of this chapter, the Secretary of Agriculture may
    complete his review and delete such area as may be necessary, but
    not to exceed seven thousand acres, from the southern tip of the
    Gore Range-Eagles Nest Primitive Area, Colorado, if the Secretary
    determines that such action is in the public interest.
    (c) Review by Secretary of the Interior of roadless areas of
      national park system and national wildlife refuges and game
      ranges and suitability of areas for preservation as wilderness;
      authority of Secretary of the Interior to maintain roadless areas
      in national park system unaffected
      Within ten years after September 3, 1964 the Secretary of the
    Interior shall review every roadless area of five thousand
    contiguous acres or more in the national parks, monuments and other
    units of the national park system and every such area of, and every
    roadless island within the national wildlife refuges and game
    ranges, under his jurisdiction on September 3, 1964 and shall
    report to the President his recommendation as to the suitability or
    nonsuitability of each such area or island for preservation as
    wilderness. The President shall advise the President of the Senate
    and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of his
    recommendation with respect to the designation as wilderness of
    each such area or island on which review has been completed,
    together with a map thereof and a definition of its boundaries.
    Such advice shall be given with respect to not less than one-third
    of the areas and islands to be reviewed under this subsection
    within three years after September 3, 1964, not less than two-
    thirds within seven years of September 3, 1964 and the remainder
    within ten years of September 3, 1964. A recommendation of the
    President for designation as wilderness shall become effective only
    if so provided by an Act of Congress. Nothing contained herein
    shall, by implication or otherwise, be construed to lessen the
    present statutory authority of the Secretary of the Interior with
    respect to the maintenance of roadless areas within units of the
    national park system.
    (d) Conditions precedent to administrative recommendations of
      suitability of areas for preservation as wilderness; publication
      in Federal Register; public hearings; views of State, county, and
      Federal officials; submission of views to Congress
      (1) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the
    Interior shall, prior to submitting any recommendations to the
    President with respect to the suitability of any area for
    preservation as wilderness - 
        (A) give such public notice of the proposed action as they deem
      appropriate, including publication in the Federal Register and in
      a newspaper having general circulation in the area or areas in
      the vicinity of the affected land;
        (B) hold a public hearing or hearings at a location or
      locations convenient to the area affected. The hearings shall be
      announced through such means as the respective Secretaries
      involved deem appropriate, including notices in the Federal
      Register and in newspapers of general circulation in the area:
      Provided, That if the lands involved are located in more than one
      State, at least one hearing shall be held in each State in which
      a portion of the land lies;
        (C) at least thirty days before the date of a hearing advise
      the Governor of each State and the governing board of each
      county, or in Alaska the borough, in which the lands are located,
      and Federal departments and agencies concerned, and invite such
      officials and Federal agencies to submit their views on the
      proposed action at the hearing or by no later than thirty days
      following the date of the hearing.

      (2) Any views submitted to the appropriate Secretary under the
    provisions of (1) of this subsection with respect to any area shall
    be included with any recommendations to the President and to
    Congress with respect to such area.
    (e) Modification or adjustment of boundaries; public notice and
      hearings; administrative and executive recommendations to
      Congress; approval of Congress
      Any modification or adjustment of boundaries of any wilderness
    area shall be recommended by the appropriate Secretary after public
    notice of such proposal and public hearing or hearings as provided
    in subsection (d) of this section. The proposed modification or
    adjustment shall then be recommended with map and description
    thereof to the President. The President shall advise the United
    States Senate and the House of Representatives of his
    recommendations with respect to such modification or adjustment and
    such recommendations shall become effective only in the same manner
    as provided for in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.

    TITLE 16 - CONSERVATION
    CHAPTER 23 - NATIONAL WILDERNESS PRESERVATION SYSTEM

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1133. Use of wilderness areas

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purposes of national forests, national park system, and
      national wildlife refuge system; other provisions applicable to
      national forests, Superior National Forest, and national park
      system
      The purposes of this chapter are hereby declared to be within and
    supplemental to the purposes for which national forests and units
    of the national park and national wildlife refuge systems are
    established and administered and - 
        (1) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to be in
      interference with the purpose for which national forests are
      established as set forth in the Act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat.
      11), and the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of June 12, 1960
      (74 Stat. 215) [16 U.S.C. 528-531].
        (2) Nothing in this chapter shall modify the restrictions and
      provisions of the Shipstead-Nolan Act (Public Law 539, Seventy-
      first Congress, July 10, 1930; 46 Stat. 1020), the Thye-Blatnik
      Act (Public Law 733, Eightieth Congress, June 22, 1948; 62 Stat.
      568), and the Humphrey-Thye-Blatnik-Andresen Act (Public Law 607,
      Eighty-Fourth Congress, June 22, 1956; 70 Stat. 326), as applying
      to the Superior National Forest or the regulations of the
      Secretary of Agriculture.
        (3) Nothing in this chapter shall modify the statutory
      authority under which units of the national park system are
      created. Further, the designation of any area of any park,
      monument, or other unit of the national park system as a
      wilderness area pursuant to this chapter shall in no manner lower
      the standards evolved for the use and preservation of such park,
      monument, or other unit of the national park system in accordance
      with sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this title, the statutory
      authority under which the area was created, or any other Act of
      Congress which might pertain to or affect such area, including,
      but not limited to, the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225; 16
      U.S.C. 432 et seq.); section 3(2) of the Federal Power Act (16
      U.S.C. 796(2)); and the Act of August 21, 1935 (49 Stat. 666; 16
      U.S.C. 461 et seq.).
    (b) Agency responsibility for preservation and administration to
      preserve wilderness character; public purposes of wilderness
      areas
      Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each agency
    administering any area designated as wilderness shall be
    responsible for preserving the wilderness character of the area and
    shall so administer such area for such other purposes for which it
    may have been established as also to preserve its wilderness
    character. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, wilderness
    areas shall be devoted to the public purposes of recreational,
    scenic, scientific, educational, conservation, and historical use.
    (c) Prohibition provisions: commercial enterprise, permanent or
      temporary roads, mechanical transports, and structures or
      installations; exceptions: area administration and personal
      health and safety emergencies
      Except as specifically provided for in this chapter, and subject
    to existing private rights, there shall be no commercial enterprise
    and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this
    chapter and, except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for
    the administration of the area for the purpose of this chapter
    (including measures required in emergencies involving the health
    and safety of persons within the area), there shall be no temporary
    road, no use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment or motorboats,
    no landing of aircraft, no other form of mechanical transport, and
    no structure or installation within any such area.
    (d) Special provisions
      The following special provisions are hereby made:
    (1) Aircraft or motorboats; fire, insects, and diseases
      Within wilderness areas designated by this chapter the use of
    aircraft or motorboats, where these uses have already become
    established, may be permitted to continue subject to such
    restrictions as the Secretary of Agriculture deems desirable. In
    addition, such measures may be taken as may be necessary in the
    control of fire, insects, and diseases, subject to such conditions
    as the Secretary deems desirable.
    (2) Mineral activities, surveys for mineral value
      Nothing in this chapter shall prevent within national forest
    wilderness areas any activity, including prospecting, for the
    purpose of gathering information about mineral or other resources,
    if such activity is carried on in a manner compatible with the
    preservation of the wilderness environment. Furthermore, in
    accordance with such program as the Secretary of the Interior shall
    develop and conduct in consultation with the Secretary of
    Agriculture, such areas shall be surveyed on a planned, recurring
    basis consistent with the concept of wilderness preservation by the
    United States Geological Survey and the United States Bureau of
    Mines to determine the mineral values, if any, that may be present;
    and the results of such surveys shall be made available to the
    public and submitted to the President and Congress.
    (3) Mining and mineral leasing laws; leases, permits, and licenses;
      withdrawal of minerals from appropriation and disposition
      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, until
    midnight December 31, 1983, the United States mining laws and all
    laws pertaining to mineral leasing shall, to the same extent as
    applicable prior to September 3, 1964, extend to those national
    forest lands designated by this chapter as "wilderness areas";
    subject, however, to such reasonable regulations governing ingress
    and egress as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture
    consistent with the use of the land for mineral location and
    development and exploration, drilling, and production, and use of
    land for transmission lines, waterlines, telephone lines, or
    facilities necessary in exploring, drilling, producing, mining, and
    processing operations, including where essential the use of
    mechanized ground or air equipment and restoration as near as
    practicable of the surface of the land disturbed in performing
    prospecting, location, and, in oil and gas leasing, discovery work,
    exploration, drilling, and production, as soon as they have served
    their purpose. Mining locations lying within the boundaries of said
    wilderness areas shall be held and used solely for mining or
    processing operations and uses reasonably incident thereto; and
    hereafter, subject to valid existing rights, all patents issued
    under the mining laws of the United States affecting national
    forest lands designated by this chapter as wilderness areas shall
    convey title to the mineral deposits within the claim, together
    with the right to cut and use so much of the mature timber
    therefrom as may be needed in the extraction, removal, and
    beneficiation of the mineral deposits, if needed timber is not
    otherwise reasonably available, and if the timber is cut under
    sound principles of forest management as defined by the national
    forest rules and regulations, but each such patent shall reserve to
    the United States all title in or to the surface of the lands and
    products thereof, and no use of the surface of the claim or the
    resources therefrom not reasonably required for carrying on mining
    or prospecting shall be allowed except as otherwise expressly
    provided in this chapter: Provided, That, unless hereafter
    specifically authorized, no patent within wilderness areas
    designated by this chapter shall issue after December 31, 1983,
    except for the valid claims existing on or before December 31,
    1983. Mining claims located after September 3, 1964, within the
    boundaries of wilderness areas designated by this chapter shall
    create no rights in excess of those rights which may be patented
    under the provisions of this subsection. Mineral leases, permits,
    and licenses covering lands within national forest wilderness areas
    designated by this chapter shall contain such reasonable
    stipulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture
    for the protection of the wilderness character of the land
    consistent with the use of the land for the purposes for which they
    are leased, permitted, or licensed. Subject to valid rights then
    existing, effective January 1, 1984, the minerals in lands
    designated by this chapter as wilderness areas are withdrawn from
    all forms of appropriation under the mining laws and from
    disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral leasing and all
    amendments thereto.
    (4) Water resources, reservoirs, and other facilities; grazing
      Within wilderness areas in the national forests designated by
    this chapter, (1) the President may, within a specific area and in
    accordance with such regulations as he may deem desirable,
    authorize prospecting for water resources, the establishment and
    maintenance of reservoirs, water-conservation works, power
    projects, transmission lines, and other facilities needed in the
    public interest, including the road construction and maintenance
    essential to development and use thereof, upon his determination
    that such use or uses in the specific area will better serve the
    interests of the United States and the people thereof than will its
    denial; and (2) the grazing of livestock, where established prior
    to September 3, 1964, shall be permitted to continue subject to
    such reasonable regulations as are deemed necessary by the
    Secretary of Agriculture.
    (5) Commercial services
      Commercial services may be performed within the wilderness areas
    designated by this chapter to the extent necessary for activities
    which are proper for realizing the recreational or other wilderness
    purposes of the areas.
    (6) State water laws exemption
      Nothing in this chapter shall constitute an express or implied
    claim or denial on the part of the Federal Government as to
    exemption from State water laws.
    (7) State jurisdiction of wildlife and fish in national forests
      Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as affecting the
    jurisdiction or responsibilities of the several States with respect
    to wildlife and fish in the national forests.
