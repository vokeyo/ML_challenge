    <br>
 Decades of experience in manned space flight have demonstrated that during any mission, unexpected events will occur.

These technologies may be in the form of devices, models, and/or instruments for use in microgravity and/or for commercial applications on Earth. The top-level requirements for a viable technology include the reduction of system hardware weight and volume and increased hardware reliability, durability, and operating lifetime. Research conducted during the Phase 1 contract should focus on demonstrating the technical feasibility of the FPDS or ISFAR protocol/system and show a path toward a Phase 2-specific deliverable. The contractor will, when appropriate, deliver a demonstration unit of the instrumentation for NASA testing before the completion of the Phase 2 contract. <br>
 <br>
<b> Fire Prevention, Detection, and Suppression </b><br>
 The objective of the Fire Prevention, Detection, and Suppression (FPDS) subtopic is to develop technologies that, when incorporated into the design philosophy and functional design of exploration vehicles and habitats, will quantitatively reduce the likelihood of a fire and reduce the impact to the mission should a fire occur.

    <br>
 This subtopic addresses monitoring and control technologies, which support the operation of an Advanced Life Support (ALS) system for future long duration space missions. There are two application areas: Acoustics Monitoring and Environmental Controls. <br>
 <br>
<b> Acoustics Monitoring Section </b><br>
 The objective is a proof-of-concept acoustic sensor system consisting of fixed and crew-worn transducers. At least ten fixed transducers shall be distributed in a habitable volume of at least 2x2x6m. The goal for the fixed microphones is to provide sound pressure level measurements with Type I measurement accuracy over the Octave Band frequency range from 63 Hz through 20 kHz. The system shall be capable of measuring 1/3 Octave Band, Octave Band, and Narrow Band sound pressure levels averaged over a specified interval with user defined data acquisition parameters. The fixed microphones shall also operate as an acoustic dosimeter with Type III accuracy and shall measure and log the maximum, A-weighted, Overall Sound Pressure Level every 30 seconds for at least 24 hours. The system shall also detect Hazard Levels of 85+ dBA and generate an alarm. The crew-worn transducer, clipped to a shirt collar, shall operate as a Type III acoustic dosimeter and shall measure and log the maximum, A-weighted, Overall Sound Pressure Level every 30 seconds for at least 24 hours. The size and mass of the device shall be comparable to COTS dosimeters. All system measurements shall be carried out remotely and the data managed by software. The system shall be demonstrated in a mock-up, and calibrations and comparisons made with appropriate instruments and methods. <br>
 <br>
<b> Environmental Controls </b><br>
 Advanced Environmental Controls - the development of advanced control system technologies is necessary for the integrated operation of environmental systems for future long-duration human space missions. The interdependence of advanced environmental processing systems requires a non-avionics requirements process that allows design for controllability. This year particular emphasis is placed on the following: <br>
 <br>
<ul> <li>  Control strategies for closed-loop systems - closed loop and biological systems have different constraints and control paradigms than conventional processes. There is a need for new control algorithms, analyses, design methodologies, strategies, and techniques to provide this capability; <br>
<li> Ontologies for integrated operations - human exploration missions involve hundreds of systems developed by dozens of organizations. To develop software that can integrate across these systems and integrate with operations requires the use of common terminology across multiple disciplines. A common ontology must be developed to enable the integration of control of advanced life support systems; and <br>
<li> Development and integration of autonomous system and inter-system control with crew and ground operations - there is a need for tools, architectures, and technologies that can support the integration of operations between crew, ground operators, ground applications, and on-board applications. <br>

 Exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit greatly limit allowable consumables and require development of innovative low maintenance, reconfigurable, reusable, or self-sufficient food production. Advancements are necessary to develop a combination of extended duration shelf life stored foods augmented with fresh foods grown within the spacecraft. Crop systems, in addition to producing fresh vegetables, storage roots, grains and legumes may contribute to air revitalization and utilize wastes from water recovery and waste management systems. <br>
 <br>
<b> Crop Systems </b><br>
 The production of biomass (in the form of edible food crops) in closed or nearly closed environments is essential for the future of long-term planetary exploration and human settlement in lunar and Mars base applications. These technologies will lead not only to food production but also to the reclamation of water, purification of air, and recovery of inedible plant resources in the comprehensive exploration of interplanetary regions. Areas in which innovations are solicited include: <br>
 <br>
<ul> <li>  Crop lighting, such as LED, solar collectors and innovative technologies. Lighting transmission and distribution systems, luminaries, fiber optics, water jackets, and other heat removal technologies are also areas of interest; <br>
<li> Water and nutrient management systems such as hydroponics and/or solid substrates for food production and separation of nutrients from waste streams are solicited. In this area, regenerable media for seed germination plant support are also of interest as is separation and recovery of usable minerals from wastewater and solid waste products for use as a source of mineral nutrients. Consideration should be given tor systems operation in microgravity and hypogravity (1/6 g on Moon, 3/8 g on Mars) environments; and <br>
<li> Other areas of interest: crop mechanization and automation, facility or system sanitation, crop health measurement, flight equipment support, structures and environmental monitoring and control technologies that are specific to crop systems (e.g., ethylene detection and removal, sensors for root zone oxygen and water content, etc.). <br>
</ul>
 <br>
<b> Food Provisioning </b><br>
<ul> <li>  Safe, nutritious, acceptable, and varied shelf-stable foods with a shelf life of 3 to 5 years will be required to support the crew during future exploration missions to the Moon or Mars. Shelf-life extension may be attained through food preservation methods and/or packaging. Packaging materials must provide sufficient oxygen and water barrier properties to maintain shelf life. Food packaging technologies are needed that minimize a potentially significant trash management problem by using packaging with less mass and volume and/or by using packaging that is biodegradable, recyclable, or reusable; <br>
<li> Processing crops or bulk ingredients into edible food ingredients or table-ready products will be necessary to provide a self-sustaining food system for an exploration mission. Equipment that is highly reliable, safe, automated, and minimizes crew time, power, water, mass, and volume will be required. Equipment for processing raw materials must be suitable for use in hypogravity (e.g., 1/6g on Moon, 3/8g on Mars) and in hermetically sealed habitats; <br>
<li> Food preparation systems will be required to heat and rehydrate the shelf stable food items and to prepare meals from the processed and re-supplied items. Technologies to support on-orbit crew meal storage, preparation, dining activities, and trash dispensing are being sought;and <br>
<li> Food quality and safety are essential components in the maintenance of crew health and well being. Efforts should be focused on control of food spoilage and food quality throughout the entire shelf life of the food. Effects of radiation on crop functionality and the stored food system quality are also needed. <br>
