BOREAS TGB-04 Water and Sediment Temperature data over the NSA-BP

Summary

The BOREAS TGB-04 team collected several data sets in support of their flux 
tower measurements at the NSA Beaver Pond site.  This data set contains water 
and sediment temperature data collected from May to September 1994.  The data 
are stored in tabular ASCII files.

1.	Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TGB-04 Water and Sediment Temperature data over the NSA-BP

1.2 Data Set Introduction

The fluxes of heat, water and CO2 from one beaver pond were measured 
continuously using the energy balance Bowen ratio approach. The diffuse and 
bubble flux CH4 were measured several times a week using chambers. The chamber 
approach was used to sample CO2 and CH4 flux from 4 to 5 additional beaver 
ponds, once ever two weeks, and regional survey of the beaver ponds once during 
the IFC.  The results of the work was extrapolated from the local to regional 
scale in collaboration with the remote-sensing project of J. Miller (York 
University). 

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The primary objective of the study was to quantify the exchange of water, and 
CH4 between boreal forest beaver ponds and the atmosphere for the ice free 
period of the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS).

The secondary objective of the study was to study the soil climate and soil 
characteristics at a forest site in conjunction with the flux studies of P. 
Crill (UNH). Soil moisture and temperatures were measured continuously, and soil 
porosity was determined.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

The main parameters are daily sediment and water temperatures.

1.5 Discussion
