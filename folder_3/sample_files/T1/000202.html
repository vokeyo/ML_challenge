           PRESIDENT AND I THINK WHAT I SAID WAS BORNE OUT. THIS
           PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WASN'T A MANDATE. MANY PEOPLE THINK IF
           ALL THE VOTES HAD BEEN COUNTED IT MIGHT HAVE COME OUT A
           DIFFERENT WAY. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS, BECAUSE IT
           WAS SO DIVISIVE, WHOEVER WON, WHETHER IT WAS AL GORE OR GEORGE
           W. BUSH, WHOEVER ACTUALLY TOOK THE OFFICE, IN THIS CASE THE
           SUPREME COURT DECIDED STOP THE COUNT AND GEORGE W. BUSH BECAME
