B. Whenever a request is made for an inspection of a residential building, structure, or
premises to determine whether it complies with this code for any Federal Housing

said costs have been assessed, and the fact that multiple owners have been joined in one
(1) action shall not be considered by the court as a misjoinder of parties. If the
structure is removed or demolished by the Director, the Director shall sell the materials
of such structure and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the
removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the chancery court
by the Director, shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by such court, and
shall be disbursed by such court to the person found to be entitled thereto by final order
or decree of such court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in
any way the power of the Metropolitan Government to define and declare nuisances and to
cause their removal or abatement, by summary proceedings or otherwise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.88.020 Appointment,

A. The Board of Property Standards and Appeals (&quot;the Board&quot;) shall consist of
seven (7) members, who shall have been residents of the area of the Metropolitan
Government area for not less than one year, and who shall continue to be eligible so long
as they shall serve, to be appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by a majority vote of the
whole membership of the Metropolitan Council. The members of the Board shall serve without
compensation, and may be removed from membership on the Board by the Mayor for continued
absence from meetings of the Board or other just causes. Replacements for any members that
resign or are dismissed from the Board shall be appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by
the Metropolitan Council in the same manner as prescribed for regular appointees. Any
member appointed as a replacement shall serve only for the remainder of the term of the
member replaced, unless subsequently reappointed for an additional term according to the
procedures set forth above.<br>
B. Of the seven members first appointed, two shall be appointed for a term of one year,
two shall be appointed for a term of two years, two shall be appointed for a term of three
years, and one shall be appointed for a term of four years. Thereafter, each member shall
be appointed for a term of four years and shall serve until the member's successor is
appointed, except that no member shall serve for more than two consecutive terms.<br>
C. One member of the Board shall be qualified in the field of building construction and
materials, one member in the field of labor, one member in the field of finance, one
member in the field of real estate, and one member in the field of business. Two members
may be appointed at large, provided that not more than two members in any of the
categories listed above may serve on the Board at the same time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.88.030 Organization and officers.<br>
Within ten (10) days after its appointment, the Board shall organize itself by election of
one of its number as Chairman and another as Vice-chairman. The Director or the Director's
duly authorized representative shall serve as Secretary to the Board and shall be
custodian of the minutes and records of the proceedings of the Board.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.88.040 Quorum--Number of votes
required for certain actions.<br>
The presence of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to constitute a quorum
for the conduct of business. The concurring vote of a majority of those members present,
but not less than four affirmative votes, shall be necessary to approve or modify any
order, requirement or decision of the Director, or to decide in favor of either the
Director or the appellant on any matter upon which the Board is required to pass or effect
any modification.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.88.050 Rules and regulations for
conduct of business.<br>
The Board shall adopt such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to conduct its
business. The Board, in open meetings, shall hear all appeals from decisions or rulings
made by the Director.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.88.060 Hearing petitions and
procedures.<br>
A. When it is claimed that the provisions of this Chapter and Chapter 16.24 of this title
do not apply, or when it is claimed that the true intent and meaning of this Chapter,
Chapter 16.24, or any of the regulations hereunder have been misconstrued or wrongly
interpreted, or when the owner of any dwelling or structure affected by an order, issued
in connection with the enforcement of this Chapter and Chapter 16.24, feels that the owner
have just cause for an appeal, the owner of such dwelling or structure, or the owner's
duly authorized agent, may request and shall be granted a hearing before the Board,
provided, that such person shall file in the office of the Director a written petition
completed pursuant to the rules, regulations, and requirements of the Board, within (20)
days after the date the order was served.<br>
B. Upon timely receipt of such petition, the Director shall set a time and place for a
hearing before the Board in accordance with its rules and regulations, and shall give the
petitioner written notice thereof. At such hearing, the petitioner shall be given an
opportunity to be heard and to show why such order should be modified. The hearing shall
be commenced within a reasonable period after such notification and in no event less than
ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after the completed petition was filed.<br>
C. When any person affected by an order of the Director makes an appeal to the Board, the
councilman of the person's district shall be notified of the appeal and the time and place
of such hearing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.88.070 Effect of Board
actions--Appeals stay imposition of order.<br>
A. The Board, after hearing the evidence presented, may sustain or modify the provisions
of the order, depending upon its findings, so as to secure the intent and purposes of this
Chapter and Chapter 16.24. Whenever such findings are made that strict compliance with
this subchapter or any order issued hereunder would impose undue or unreasonable hardship
upon the owner or occupants of property affected, the Board may modify the order and
extend the time limit given in the order for compliance, and may further stipulate special
conditions to be met by the owner as mandatory conditions to such extension of time or
modification of the order. If the Board sustains or modifies such order, it shall be
deemed a final order unless appealed therefrom.<br>
B. No person or party in interest who has appealed the order of the Director to the Board
in accordance to the provisions for appeal hereinabove set forth, shall be subject to any
penalty for the violation of this Chapter or Chapter 16.24 until the board has issued a
final order sustaining or modifying the order of the Director, with which final order the
appellant refuses or fails to comply, and any appeal thereon is finally disposed of by a
court of competent jurisdiction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.88.080 Records of Board decisions.<br>
The findings and decisions of the Board shall be summarized, reduced to writing, and
entered as a matter of public record in the office of the Director.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.88.090 Appeals from Director and
or Board decisions.<br>
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board or by an order of the Director, may seek
relief therefrom in any court of competent jurisdiction, as provided by the laws of the
State.</font></p>
