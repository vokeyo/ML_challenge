Subject: Minutes of SCT meeting February 3, 2003

There has been a misunderstanding about what hybrids started means in the
last two weeks. It means hybrids with chips started to load. This has been
corrected this week

Hybrids started as of end last week     71      In last week    12
Hybrids up to fanout bonds              40      In last week    0
 
Modules started as of end last week     22      In last week    4
Modules test complete                    7      In last week    4

The summary files are at 
http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~gilg/SCTWeeklyMeetings/Feb32003/

For some reason, one of these is currently protected, so I have attached
it(hybrids and modules vs time). I encourage you to look particularly at
the final summary, which attempts to summarize the current status of all
modules. I have also added an IV summary.

Hybrids
We decided to ship to UCSC ASAP existing fixtures at LBL to complete all
needed at UCSC. This will bring LBL to a halt on chip mounting, but will
force LBL to complete the necessary fixtures to continue. LBL will
continue to do all fanout bonding. Thus UCSC will mount chips, do the chip
bonds, test and burnin. THe first some hybrids will be sent to LBL for
testing to compare with UCSC results. The goals is to get some real
hybrids made at UCSC before the SCT week in March.

We received today 32 more hybrids from Japan. They are good. Rhonda will
split and ready them to sent to UCSC along with hybrids needing chip
replacement(Sandra to choose).

Module Assembly
Fixtures A0, A1 and A2 are now in use but not yet clear if results are
repeatable. Results from P019-P022 looked at and some adjustments
necessary for next modules. P023 and maybe P024 to be started today. Note
that I have include histogram of midyf in the folder referenced above. We
are current within +/-8 microns except for P001 in which gross error was
made. THere are many other dimensional specs. If you look at the
FinalSummary files you will note that we are often just over on some of
the Z specs, in addition to midyf relative to current spec.We are
sometimes also over tolerances on stereo angle and related. Need to
understand how to handle this.

Module Testing
Sandra found there are "flaky" problems with some channels in Cracow HV
modules, which may
explain some of the problems with tripping modules. Not yet clear how this
will be resolved, but will slow down testing. Modules with "good" hybrid,
P016 has 6 bad channels. 5 of these are from bonding problems. Realized
this is not systematically documented on travellers but must be. Rhonda to
follow up.

Inventory
We realized too late that we will run out of detectors in the next few
days. More detectors will be shipped from Japan "early this week". To
attempt to avoid this in future, will include inventory each Monday as
part of these minutes. Frank is responsible for detectors and baseboards,
Rhonda for hybrids and Sandra for chips.

Housekeeping
There are many, many improvements to implement in the general area of
housekeeping and organization. Among the most important are

1) vacuum dry lockers. I found that there is a powder residue apparently
left over from cleaning the trays in the locker. This has to be vacuumed
out(using HEPA filter vacs). I did this on the module locker but all of
the lockers need to be done. I will organize this. This may be some/all
of the white specs seen on lots of modules.

2) reconfigure central tables
we need more space in the central tables, need to move computer and
monitor and so forth as soon as possible. Carl, Frank and me to organize

3) stations and tools
It's driving me nuts(OK nuttier) to have to search for tools each time an
operation is needed. We need bins(Steve to get) and organized stations for
each step. I will follow up on this with also Frank.

4) cleaning and related
I cleaned off the top of the IV box(very dusty) and where the old dry box
sat(ditto). We need to implement a regular and reasonable cleaning
procedure each day(trash cans for example) and each week(floor, rotating
surfaces). I will attempt to do this with Steve but this will require help
from everyone.
