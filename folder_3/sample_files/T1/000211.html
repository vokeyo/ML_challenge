          <p><strong><font size="+1">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Response to 
            Vessel Grounding/Oil Spill off Unalaska Island</font></strong></p>
          <p>February 25, 2005: After lightering operations on the <em>M/V Selendang 
            Ayu</em> wreck were concluded on February 11, 2005, the response effort 
            moved into a winter operations phase. Fisheries water quality sampling 
            and seafood inspections are ongoing during this period, but clean 
            up activities were curtailed and monitoring limited to two flights 
            per week weather permitting. Assessment activities will resume on 
            April 4 and full scale clean up activities on April 15.</p>
          <p>The initial response effort resulted in the collection of approximately 
            38,000 bags of oily solid waste consisting of vegetation, wrack, sand/gravel, 
            and driftwood; 1,608 bird carcasses; 5 otter carcasses; and a total 
            of 144,931 gallons of oil, diesel and oil/water mixture. The bow of 
            the <em>Selendang Ayu</em> is now completely submerged and the Unified 
            Command estimates that 321,052 gallons of IFO and an unknown amount 
            of marine diesel fuel were released into the environment.</p>
          <p>Beginning in April, Service personnel will head back out to Unalaska 
            to participate on Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Teams (SCAT), assigned 
            to assess the post-winter oiling shoreline conditions. Service biologists 
            will conduct wildlife reconnaissance, including observations of breeding 
            birds in the shoreline zone, oiled wildlife sightings, and presence 
            of oiled carcasses. Wildlife search and recovery teams may be activated 
            based on SCAT team observations. Service representatives will also 
            coordinate wildlife needs with SCAT activities and cleanup operations. 
          </p>
