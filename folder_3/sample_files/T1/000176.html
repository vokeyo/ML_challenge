<pre class="entry_text">Shoreline Assessment Report and Cleanup Guidelines, 9 August 2000

Shoreline Assessment Team Membership

Team 1:				Team 2:

Scott Zengel, NOAA SST		Cathy Porthouse, FDEP
Anne Meador, FDEP			Jason Maddox, NOAA SST
Alan Webb, USFWS			Robert Frank, USFWS.

On 9 August 2000, Team 1 surveyed North of Port Everglades in Zones 1 and 2, segments
prefixed with &amp;#8220;N&amp;#8221;.  Team 2 surveyed South of Port Everglades, segments
prefixed with &amp;#8220;S&amp;#8221;.  Summary results are listed below from North to South.
High tide (+ 2.5 ft) was at 17:08.  Shoreline types were primarily fine-grained sand beach
with limited areas of mixed sand and gravel beach, and a few riprap structures (jetties
and on minor groins).

 Other Shoreline Assessment Observations

&amp;#8226; No buried oil was found.  Trenches were dug in all shoreline segments described
above.  The north side of jetties and groins were particularly targeted.


&amp;#8226; Tarball size was roughly 1-2 inches.  Several larger tarballs were observed for
shoreline segments South of Port Everglades.


&amp;#8226; Tarballs in all areas were sticky and had incorporated some sediment (sand).
Throughout the surveyed areas, tarballs placed in the surf zone immediately sank and
rolled along the bottom in the swash zone.  Tarballs which pick up sand on the shoreline
and are later re-mobilized would likely fail to float.  They could get buried or
transported to other areas.


&amp;#8226; Little oil was observed on the water surface or in the nearshore water column.
Sporadic tarball concentrations were observed in limited areas north of several jetties,
groins, and pier structures rolling along the bottom in the swash zone.


&amp;#8226; Riprap structures had no oil stranded on the riprap surface or visibly trapped in
spaces between the riprap boulders.  Tarballs appeared to be held slightly off of riprap
areas by wave reflection or eddies on the north sides of jetties and groins.


&amp;#8226; Potential submerged oil or oiled wrack accumulations were observed in several
locations in linear nearshore troughs running parallel to the beaches. It was unclear if
or how much oil these areas may contain.  It is possible these areas are mainly
accumulations of clean wrack.  Several sites will be investigated in more detail during
assessments planned for Thursday, 10 August 2000.  If these areas are found to contain
large amounts of submerged oil or oiled wrack, additional areas will be surveyed and
cleanup needs and options will be addressed.


Shoreline Cleanup Definitions and Specifications

&amp;#8226; Mechanical beach raking refers to use of the &amp;#8220;beach cleaning&amp;#8221; machines
employed by several municipalities in the area.  Due to potential disturbance of turtle
nests, mechanical raking is to be applied only within the intertidal zone.  Mechanical
raking should not be conducted above the high tide line.  Mechanical beach raking should
also not be conducted within John U. Lloyd SRA, due to potential impacts to turtles.


&amp;#8226; Manual pickup refers to the manual collection of tarballs and oiled wrack using
hand tools such shovels and rakes, or removal by hand.  Manual cleaning should be
conducted so that a minimum amount of non-oiled sediment is removed.  The top-priority for
manual pickup is segment SB, in Zone 2, within John U. Lloyd SRA.


Shoreline Cleanup Thresholds and End Points

&amp;#8226; Significant oiled wrack accumulations have been identified by the shoreline
assessment teams, referenced by shoreline segment and zone.  Within these areas, all
visibly oiled wrack (e.g., oil can be seen mixed with the wrack) should be removed.  Clean
wrack should not be removed.


&amp;#8226; The cleanup end point for oiled wrack is no easily observed oil mixed in wrack
stand lines.


&amp;#8226; Following or concurrent with oiled wrack removal, or in sand beach areas without
oiled wrack, tarball bands with cover values described as sporadic, patchy, broken, or
continuous should be manually removed as specified by the shoreline assessment teams.
Tarball bands described as trace should not be removed.


&amp;#8226; The cleanup end point for tarball removal is &lt;5% cover within any remaining
tarball bands.


These cleanup end points have been developed based on the background level of oiled wrack
and tarballs generally encountered in the area, environmental considerations (primarily
sea turtles on nesting beaches), and health and safety concerns.  Using the &lt;5% cleanup
end point for tarballs could still result in recreational beach users coming in contact
with tarballs.  Beach users should be advised to watch for tarballs and avoid accidental
ingestion and prolonged dermal contact, as specified in health and safety briefings
provided by the NOAA Scientific Support Team.
