<P>Technologies developed under this Topic are needed for the Advanced Human Support 

  Technology Program (and other programs) to assure robust and reliable capabilities 

  to support health and safety of human explorers during long-duration space missions. 

  In addition, it is the goal of this topic to drive down the cost of human exploration 

  missions and campaigns beyond Earth orbit and to develop and demonstrate critically 

  needed capabilities for human activities in space. Some selected objectives 

  of this topic include: (1) Developing innovative, affordable and highly operable 

  new technologies for extravehicular activity (EVA) systems and advanced space 

  habitation systems, and (2) Establishing a foundation for profitable commercial 

  development of space applications of these technologies in the mid- to far-term.

<p>Advanced extravehicular activity (EVA) systems are necessary for the successful 

  human exploration of all destinations beyond low Earth orbit. Complex missions 

  to the Moon, Mars, L2, and other remote sites require innovative approaches 

  for maximizing human productivity and for providing the capability to perform 

  useful work tasks. Requirements include reduction of system hardware weight 

  and volume; increased hardware reliability, durability, and operating lifetime 

  (before resupply, recharge and maintenance, or replacement is necessary); reduced 

  hardware and software costs; increased human comfort; and less-restrictive work 

  performance capability in the space environment, in hazardous ground-level contaminated 

  atmospheres, or in extreme ambient thermal environments. All proposed Phase 

  I research must lead to specific Phase II experimental development that could 

  be integrated into a functional EVA system. Areas in which innovations are solicited 

  include the following: </p>

<p><b>Environmental Protection </b></p>

<ul>

  <li>Passive and active radiation protection technologies that protect the suited 

    crewmember from radiation particles. </li>

  <li>Dust and abrasion protection materials to exclude dust and withstand abrasion. 

  </li>

</ul>

<p><b>EVA Mobility </b></p>

<ul>

  <li>Nonmetallic low profile space suit bearings that maximize rotation and mobility 

    and are also lightweight and low cost. </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Life Support System</b> </p>

<ul>

  <li>High-capacity oxygen storage, supply and recharge systems for normal and 

    emergency supply of oxygen for breathing. </li>

  <li>Low-venting or non-venting regenerable individual life support subsystem(s) 

    concepts for crewmember cooling, heat rejection, and removal of expired water 

    vapor and carbon dioxide. </li>

  <li>Fuel cell technology that can provide compact high-energy power to a space 

    suit. </li>

  <li>Convection and freezable radiators that will be low cost and weight for 

    thermal control. </li>

  <li>Space water membrane evaporators for a space suit. </li>

  <li>Variable conductance flexible external suit garment that can function as 

    a radiator for high metabolic loads and as an insulator for low metabolic 

    loads. </li>

  <li>Extremely thermal conductive fibers or other alternatives to water-cooling 

    loop tubing.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Sensors/Communications/Cameras </b></p>

<ul>

  <li>Space suit mounted displays for use both inside and outside of the spacesuit. 

    Outside mounted displays must be low profile and compatible with space environment. 

    Internal displays must be 100 percent O<sub>2</sub> safe, unobtrusive and ultimately 

    project onto the helmet visor. </li>

  <li>IR camera that displays temperature of environment for safe handling of 

    objects, geology science support and are integratible onto a spacesuit or 

    rover.<br>

  </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Integration </b></p>

<ul>

  <li>Robotics and display interface software that permit autonomous voice control 

    via suited EVA crew. </li>

  <li>Minimum gas loss and low power airlock providing quick exit and entry, and 

    can accommodate an incapacitated crewmember. </li>

  <li>Light weight, non-metallic; environmentally harden manual or powered tools 

    for driving fasteners.</li>

  <li>Innovative self-locking, multi-use captive fasteners. Tether hooks for equipment 

    or crewmembers. </li>

  <li>Low profile, low power and flexible body/limb mobility sensors, signal conditioners 

    and software for immediate data analysis display. Will be used internally 

    or externally for space suit garment quantitative mobility testing.</li>

<p>Advanced habitation technology is sought to enable Human Exploration and Development 

  of Space Enterprise future orbital, planetary and deep space applications. Space 

  and planetary habitation, pressure structures and unpressurized shelters are 

  being sought out to provide innovative structural solutions that combine high 

  strength and light weight materials along with the reliability, durability, 

  reparability, radiation protection, packaging efficiency and life-cycle cost 

  effectiveness. Advances in material developments and manufacturing techniques 

  that enable the structure to &quot;self-heal&quot; and the emplacement, erection, 

  deployment or manufacturing of habitats in space or on the Moon and Mars are 

  considered enabling technologies for the evolution of humans into space and 

  the eventual settlement on Mars. Integration of sensors, circuitry and automated 

  components to enable self-deployment and &quot;smart&quot; structures are considered 

  necessary for the habitat to operate autonomously. The objective is to create 

  an advanced habitat that becomes a &quot;living&quot; structure that not only 

  runs autonomously, but also has self-healing capability. A number of technologies 

  and techniques have been proposed that allow the delivery of deployable habitats 

  to space and planet surfaces or the manufacturing and construction of habitats 

  on planet surfaces. These include:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Underground development of habitable structures that meet human space flight 

    requirements. </li>

  <li>Design, manufacturing and testing of inflatable structures that meet human 

    space flight requirements. </li>

  <li>Manufacturing in situ (Moon and Mars) structures for autonomously developing 

    habitats that meet human space flight requirements. </li>

  <li>Techniques for fully integrated skin and sensors/circuitry that enables 

    &quot;smart&quot; structures that autonomously detect, analyze, and correct 

    (repair) structural failure. </li>

  <li>Integrating miniaturization technology into the habitat skin, thus reducing 

    weight and increasing self-autonomy. </li>

</ul>

<p>Quantitative assessments require innovative, space flight compatible habitat 

  structures that meet the needs for human space flight and structural integrity. 

  The Moon and Mars are of the most interest. Consideration of flight-testing 

  in space or at the Moon should be considered. Areas in which innovations are 

  solicited include the following technologies for use in space (zero gravity) 

  and/or the planetary surfaces: </p>
