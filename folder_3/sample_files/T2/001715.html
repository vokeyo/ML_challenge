SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act 
of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173, enacted on December 8, 2003) 
establishes a new prescription drug benefit under Part D of the 
Medicare Program through competing prescription drug plans. The 
Secretary will approve or disapprove prescription drug plans based on 
various requirements in the statute, including the requirements 
specified in section 1860D-11(e)(2)(D)(i) and (ii) of the MMA. One of 
the requirements is that the Secretary does not find that the design of 
the plan and its benefits are likely to discourage enrollment by 
certain Part D eligible individuals. The Secretary may not find that 
the design of categories and classes within a formulary discourages 
enrollment if the categories and classes are consistent with Model 
Guidelines established by United States Pharmacopeia (USP).
    In an effort to establish these guidelines, MMA requires the 
Secretary to request USP to develop, in consultation with 
pharmaceutical benefit managers and other interested parties, a list of 
categories and classes (Model Guidelines) that may be used by 
prescription drug plans and to revise the classification from time to 
time to reflect changes in therapeutic uses of covered Part D drugs and 
additions of new covered Part D drugs. At the request of the Secretary 
and as specified in section 1860D-4(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the MMA, USP is in 
the process of developing the Model Guidelines that may be used by 
prescription drug plans and is seeking comments on the draft Model 
Guidelines.

II. Provisions of the Notice

    The purpose of this meeting is to provide information on the draft 
of the Model Guidelines for Classes and Categories of Drugs to be used 
in Part D plan formularies and to allow for public comment.
    Meeting Format: USP Staff and the USP Medicare Model Guideline 
Expert Committee (Expert Committee) will present a draft of the Model 
Guidelines and the approach and methodology of establishing the Model 
Guidelines. Interested persons may present data, information, or views 
orally or in writing, on issues directly related to the Model 
Guidelines.
