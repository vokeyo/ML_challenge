   <p align="center"><font face="Arial">Committee Republicans Announce Hearing
   to Evaluate the Impact of Final Overtime Rule on Workers &amp; Employers</font></p>
   </font>
   <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">WASHINGTON, D.C.</font></b><font
   face="Arial" size="2"> – House Workforce Committee Republicans today
   announced the Committee will hold a hearing on April 28, with Labor Secretary
   Elaine Chao scheduled to testify, to evaluate the Labor Department’s final
   regulation on overtime pay and its impact on workers and employers. The
   Department’s economic analysis indicates that few, if any, workers making
   less than $100,000 per year will be adversely affected by the final
   regulation. The Department estimates that the only workers who will likely be
   affected are those making more than $100,000 annually, whose white-collar job
   responsibilities qualify them as exempt from overtime. According to the
   Department, no more than 107,000 workers nationwide fall into this
   highly-compensated category.</font></p>
   <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Department’s final rule
   protects the overtime rights of blue-collar workers, union workers, nurses,
   veterans, firefighters, policemen and similar public safety workers, and
   responds to concerns raised with earlier proposed regulations during the
   comment period by clarifying that the overtime rights of these workers <i><u>are
   not</u> </i>affected under the final rule. Committee Republicans commended
   the Department for its willingness to listen and make adjustments to the
   final regulation to give new overtime pay rights to millions of low-income
   workers.</font></p>
   <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">“I’m pleased that the
   Department has listened to public comments and taken into account those
   concerns in updating its final regulation,” said Education &amp; the
   Workforce Committee Chairman John Boehner (R-OH). “I look forward to
   reviewing the proposal in depth and hearing more specifics from Secretary
   Chao at our Committee hearing next week.”</font></p>
   <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">After reviewing more than 75,000
   public comments on draft regulations proposed in March 2003, the Labor
   Department today announced an updated final regulation that is intended to
   simplify and modernize decades-old regulations addressing overtime exemptions
   for certain employees, including low-income workers that are unfairly denied
   overtime pay under current law. Current rules allow a worker earning as
   little as $8,060 to qualify as a ‘white collar’ employee, therefore
   preventing the worker from receiving overtime pay. The overtime regulations
   under the Fair Labor Standards Act have not been substantially changed in 54
   years.</font></p>
   <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">“Today’s overtime regulations
   are complex, confusing, and often lead to needless litigation, so the
   Department should be commended for its efforts to modernize these outdate
   regulations and provide new overtime protections and greater overtime pay to
   working Americans,” added Boehner.</font></p>
   <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Under the regulations issued
   today by the Department, which are scheduled to go into effect at the end of
   the summer, any worker making less than $23,660 annually will automatically
   become entitled to overtime pay. According to the Department’s analysis,
   the final regulation will extend new overtime rights to an estimated 1.3
   million workers, and strengthens existing overtime protections for 5.4
   million working Americans.</font></p>
   <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">“These outdated regulations are
   so complex that it is next to impossible for workers to know whether they are
   entitled to overtime, for employers to know how to pay their employees, and
   for DOL to enforce these workplace protections,” said Workforce Protections
   Subcommittee Chairman Charlie Norwood (R-GA). “I am pleased that the
   Department’s proposal will provide additional protections to low-income
   workers and ensure that they are entitled to overtime pay, and I look forward
   to hearing more about the Department’s new proposal at our upcoming
   Committee hearing.”</font></p>
