        <p></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) is pleased to have
        the opportunity to provide this statement to the House Commerce Subcommittees on Health
        and Environment and Oversight and Investigations and the Veterans&#146; Affairs
        Subcommittee on Health. USP strongly supports Congressional consideration of actions it
        might take to ensure the significant reduction of preventable medical mistakes that occur
        throughout the continuum of the prescription, dispensing, administration, and use of
        medicines. USP further believes that development and implementation of federal legislation
        and regulatory policies, which will direct and guide public and private initiatives at the
        national, state, and local levels, must be achieved to ensure patient safety from medical
        mistakes, and to reduce substantively the multi-billion dollars that such mistakes
        currently cost the health care system each year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">USP comments, offered for consideration, cover the
        following: </font><ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Information about the U. S. Pharmacopeia&#146;s 30-year
            record of stimulating voluntary health care practitioner reporting and using the analysis
            of those reports to improving patient safety.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Background on USP&#146;s ability to affect change in drug
            product labeling, packaging, and nomenclature when such are identified as contributing to

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Background </font></u></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">USP, founded in 1820, is a volunteer-based, not-for-profit
        organization whose sole mission is to </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">promote the public health by establishing and disseminating
        officially recognized standards of quality and authoritative information for the use of
        medicines and related articles for professionals, patients, and consumers. It is composed
        of approximately 500 members representing state associations and colleges of medicine and
        pharmacy, ten agencies of the federal government, and about 75 national professional,
        scientific and trade organizations, and members-at-large, including government agencies
        from other countries that recognize USP standards and non-U.S. pharmacopeias. The
        USP&#146;s expertise as a standards-setting body has been recognized by Congress in the
        enactment of the Drug Import Act of 1848, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, the Federal
        Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1938, and by the Food and Drug Modernization Act in 1997,
        and others. Standards published in the official compendia<i>, </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">U. S. Pharmacopeia</i> and <i>National Formulary (USP-NF)</i>
        are also referenced in most state pharmacy laws governing practice. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">USP began developing information relating to proper
        medicine use, in 1970, as support to its </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">standards-setting activities. The <i>USP DI</i>, the
        compendia of USP drug information, is today recognized by the Federal Omnibus Budget
        Reconciliation Acts of 1990 and 1994 as a reimbursement resource for Medicaid Agencies
        considering issues associated with off-label uses of medicines and guidance for patient
        counseling. Based upon its federal recognition, and its reputation as a credible,
        authoritative, and non-biased source of information developed by approximately 800
        volunteer experts, <i>USP DI®</i> also serves as a reimbursement resource for insurers
        and third party payers, and as the basis for drug formulary decisions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The process by which drug standards and information are
        developed is open, participative (notice and comment) and subject to integrity safeguards,
        including conflict of interest disclosure.</font></p>
        <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">USP Practitioner and Product Experience Programs </font></u></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because of our concern with the quality of drug products on
        the market, in 1971, the USP co-founded the Drug Product Problem Reporting Program&#151;a
        national program in which health professionals were asked to voluntarily report problems
        and defects experienced with drug products on the market. Often the product problems or
        defects had to do with inadequate packaging or labeling&#151;labeling that could lead to
        confusion on the part of health professionals or lead to errors; for example, look-alike
        color or design labels (color and design) and sound-alike drug names. Today, we continue
        to operate our Drug Product Problem Reporting, and a newer program, the Veterinary
        Practitioners Reporting Program, which collect voluntary reports on human and animal drug
        products.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eight years ago, in 1991, USP decided to focus more
        intensely on the problem of medication errors and what it could do to prevent them. Our
        focus today is on both the product and on the system in which the product is prescribed,
        dispensed, administered, and used. USP does not set practice standards <i>per se</i>, but
        practicably, many of our standards do indirectly affect professional practice and many
        practice standards are based on <i>USP-NF</i> standards. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The USP learned that The Institute for Safe Medication
        Practices (ISMP) was seeking support of a national organization to bring its program, The
        Medication Errors Reporting (MER) Program, to the national level. USP agreed to coordinate
        the national program for ISMP. The </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">MER Program is now one of four USP voluntary, spontaneous
        reporting programs for health care practitioners. The MER Program is operated under the
        umbrella of the USP Practitioner and Product Experience Division. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since late 1991, the MER Program has received more than
        4,000 voluntary reports of actual and potential medication errors. We also continue to
        receive medication error reports through USP&#146;s other reporting programs. These
        reports have identified errors in various health care delivery environments, including
        hospitals, nursing homes, physicians&#146; office, pharmacies, emergency response
        vehicles, and home care. Through these reports, we have seen that errors are
        multi-disciplinary and multi-factorial. They can be and are committed by experienced and
        inexperienced health professionals, support personnel, interns, students, and even
        patients and their caregivers. Medication errors can and regularly do occur anywhere along
        the continuum from prescribing to transcribing to dispensing and administration. The
        causes of errors may be attributed to human error, to product names or designs, and to the
        medication handling and delivery systems in which the products are used and individuals
        operate and interact. For purposes of voluntary reporting, USP does not seek to limit the
        types of errors that may be reported, because all information received may have some
        future value in determining how to reduce or prevent errors. We do not, however, actively
        solicit reports of adverse drug reactions, but USP cooperates with the Food and Drug
        Administration as a MedWatch partner and refer all reports submitted to USP.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We recognize that an actual error may be reported as a
        potential error because of liability concerns, or a facility&#146;s risk management
        policies, so each report is treated with the utmost seriousness by USP, no matter how it
        is characterized by the reporter. As each MER report is received, it is shared with the
        product manufacturer and with the Food and Drug Administration. USP does not require, in
        the MER Program, that the name of the reporter, patient identity, or facility be provided.
        If provided, however, USP respects the desire of the reporter to keep his or her identity
        confidential and will purge the identity of the individuals or institutions named in the
        report in accordance with the instructions of the reporter. Reporters are advised of any
        actions resulting from their report either individually or through USP&#146;s <i>Quality
        Review </i>publication, which is disseminated to all persons who have reported to the MER
        Program and is publicly available on USP&#146;s web site<b>. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">USP&#146;s Ability to Affect Change </font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">USP has 30 years of experience and demonstrated
        effectiveness in designing and operating voluntary reporting systems for health care
        professionals relating to drugs and their use, and using those data to improve product
        standards and safe drug use information.</font></p>
        <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Standards-Setting Authority</font></u></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Encouraging the reporting of errors is only one aspect of
        USP&#146;s efforts to promote safety of the medication use system. USP evaluates and
        implements, through its standards-setting authority, changes in drug products to prevent
        the recurrence of errors. The following examples describe some of the changes or other
        steps taken by USP in response to MER Program reports.</font><ul>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Death reported due to the accidental misadministration of
              concentrated Potassium Chloride Injection led to (1) changing the official USP name to
              Potassium Chloride for Injection <u>Concentrate</u> (emphasis added) to give more
              prominence to the need to dilute the product prior to use; (2) labels must now bear a
              boxed warning &quot;Concentrate: Must be Diluted Before Use;&quot; and (3) the cap must be
              black in color (the use of black caps is restricted to this drug product only), and (4)
              the cap must be imprinted in a contrasting color with the words, &quot;Must be
              Diluted.&quot;</font></li>

        </ul>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Deaths reported due to the confusion and resultant injection
              of the anticancer drug, Vincristine Sulfate for Injection, directly into the spine instead
              of into the vein, resulted in changes in the requirements for packaging by pharmacies and
              manufacturers preparing ready-to-use doses. Each dose, whether prepared by the
              manufacturer or the pharmacist, now must be wrapped in a covering labeled &quot;FOR
              INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY&quot; and that covering may not be removed until the moment of
              injection.</font></li>

              and <i>Amiodarone </i>have lead USP and the United States Adopted Names (USAN) Council to

              incorporated into the USP DI information in a special section in each drug monograph to
              caution health professionals on each drug&#146;s proper use based upon reports of errors
              received through the program.</font></li>

        &quot;Vincristine Sulfate Monographs Revised&#133;Dispensing Pharmacy Practice
        Affected.&quot;}</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Throughout its 180-year history, USP has focused on
        improving the quality of our medicines and their appropriate use. All of USP&#146;s
        programs focus on these goals. The standards in the official compendia, the <i>USP-NF</i>,
        define the identity, strength, purity, quality, packaging and labeling of drugs and their
        dosage forms. The USP is a member, with the American Medical Association, American
        Pharmaceutical Association, and the Food and Drug Administration of the United States
        Adopted Names Council (USAN) and publishes USAN names in the <i>USP Dictionary of Drug
        USAN and International Drug Names</i>, which is an international resource for
        pharmaceutical manufacturers, regulators, and health care practitioners. As noted
        elsewhere in<b> </b>this testimony, USP has taken actions, independently and in<b> </b>concert
        with USAN, to change the names of drugs and dosage forms when they have resulted in
        medication errors.<b> </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Reported medication errors also have brought about other
        changes in USP standards and guidance to practitioners. For example, (1) USP discontinued
        recognition in the <i>USP-NF</i> of the apothecary system, a centuries old system of
        measuring weights and measures, in favor of the metric system in order to avoid
        misinterpretations that led to overdoses; (2) USP has made changes in general label
        requirements for marketed drug products, strengths less than one unit must be expressed as
        a decimal preceded by a zero (e.g. 0.1 grams, not .1 grams) to avoid ten-fold overdoses;
        and (3) USP standards also require that the strength of a product when expressed as a
        whole number be shown without a zero trailing the decimal to avoid ten-fold overdoses by
        the lack of recognition of the decimal point (e.g. 1mg, not 1.0 mg).</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prior to the formation of the Food and Drug Administration
        (FDA) Office of Post Marketing Drug Risk Assessment, the Agency developed a formal
        mechanism for receiving and evaluating MER reports&#151;the Subcommittee on Medication
        Errors. USP and FDA also created a joint advisory panel on the Simplification and
        Improvement of Injection Labeling to reduce medication errors. The Food and Drug
        Modernization Act of 1997 recognizes product labeling recommendations of that joint
        initiative.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1991, to expand the scope of the MER Program, USP
        developed a joint program with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. The Boards
        of Pharmacy database is maintained by USP and assists each Board of Pharmacy to determine
        the relative extent of errors in its state and contributes to the overall incident
        collection effort. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to using the MER program to stimulate changes
        in enforceable standards and information, USP has used the MER information to develop
        educational tools for the health professions. In 1993, a curricular resource entitled--<i>Understanding
        and Preventing Medication Errors--</i>was distributed at no charge of colleges of pharmacy
        throughout the U.S. USP also has attempted to reach the public directly to teach patients
        how to protect themselves from medication errors through the development of a public
        service campaign&#151;<i>Just Ask&#133;About Preventing Medication Errors.</i></font><u></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">National Coordinating Council for Medication Error
        Reporting and Prevention</font></u><i></p>
        <p></i><font face="Arial" size="2">USP has worked diligently during the past eight years,
        particularly in the standards-setting area, to build coalitions among health care
        organizations and to provide health care expert review of medication errors. In 1995 USP
        spearheaded formation of the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting
        and Prevention (NCC MERP). USP is the founding organization and continues to serve as NCC
        MERP Secretariat. To date, NCC MERP, comprises of 17 national organizations and federal
        agencies that share a common mission to promote the reporting, understanding and
        prevention of medication errors. Member organizations include practice organizations of
        medicine, nursing, and pharmacy, the licensing board of pharmacy and nursing,
        organizations of the pharmaceutical industry, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the
        Joint Commission, regulators, the FDA, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of
        Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the American Hospital Association, and USP. In the years
        since its inception, the Council has produced internationally recognized work products,
        such as:</font><ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">a standardized definition of &quot;medication error.&quot;

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Council is now re-examining how the standardized
        definitions noted above and in the attached <i>Quality Review: </i>&quot;Use
        Caution&#151;Avoid Confusion&quot; can be honed, based upon experience gained from the MER
        and MedMARx (see below) Programs to provide clearer differentiation between categories. In
        addition the Council is examining issues of process failures in the use of verbal orders,
        benchmarking and inter-organizational comparisons, and error rates.</font></p>
        <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ad hoc Advisory Panel on Medication Errors</font></u></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1996 USP appointed an Advisory Panel on Medication
        Errors, an interdisciplinary group of health care practitioners who: review reports
        submitted to the USP Medication Errors Reporting Program; make recommendations for USP
        standards-setting; and make recommendations and participate in the activity of the NCC
        MERP. Mr. Michael Cohen, ISMP President, served as the first chair of this Panel and
        continues to serve as a member.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 2000, USP will constitute a new expert committee on
        &quot;Safe Medication Use&quot; that will fulfill a broader scope of responsibilities of
        the Advisory Panel that it will replace. The new expert </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">committee will review data and provide guidance for the
        development of best practice solutions that will result in the reduction and prevention of
        medication errors.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The USP DI database is recognized internationally as
        containing the most up-to-date and authoritative information on off-label uses, warnings,
        contraindications, etc. New USP programs that will enrich the USP DI database will focus
        on the special needs to standardize products and develop information for neonatal,
        pediatric, and geriatric patients and populations. A unique contribution of the pediatric
        effort, developed in conjunction with experts in pediatric medicine communications is the
        &quot;Ten Guiding Principles on the Use of Medicines by Children and Adolescents.&quot;
        These principles have been distributed broadly and are being used in educational materials
        by pharmaceutical manufacturers and volunteer organizations. [See Guiding Principles Ruler

        <b><p><font face="Arial" size="2">USP&#146;s MedMARx Program</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In early 1998, USP developed a nationwide program for
        hospitals to report medication errors. Hospitals were eager to submit reports to USP if
        reporting could be done anonymously and in a standardized format that would allow
        hospitals to track trends, and compare their data to other participating hospitals.
        USP&#146;s goal was to develop a model for hospitals first, ensure success of the model,
        then broaden the model to include other health care settings, e.g. long-term and
        ambulatory care settings, and other types of reporting such as medical error and adverse
        drug reactions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On July 27, 1998, USP made MedMARx&#153; available to
        hospitals nationwide. MedMARx (pronounced <i>med&#146; marks</i>) is an
        internet-accessible, anonymous reporting program that enables hospitals to voluntarily
        report, track and trend data incorporating nationally standardized data elements (i.e.,
        definitions and taxonomy) of the USP Medication Errors Reporting Program, the National
        Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP), and the
        American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. MedMARx is structured to support an
        interdisciplinary systems-approach to medication error reduction and fosters a
        non-punitive environment for reporting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hospitals are encouraged to use MedMARx as part of the
        organization&#146;s internal quality improvement process, thereby extending their
        &quot;peer-review&quot; group to the group of hospitals in the program. Hospitals review
        the errors entered by other institutions in &quot;real time&quot; and also can view any
        reported action taken by another institution in response to an error or to avoid future
        similar errors. This feature affords institutions the opportunity to examine errors in a
        proactive manner. For example, the institution can review the error profile of a drug or
        class of drugs before a product is added to the institution&#146;s formulary to determine
        if certain risk prevention measures or training programs should be instituted prior to the
        drug&#146;s availability within the institution. Or, if the error profile is significantly
        serious, a determination to <u>not </u>stock the drug can be made. MedMARx also supports
        the performance improvement standards of the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of
        Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), which requires institutions to look outward at the
        experiences of others in order to reduce risk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Currently over 150 hospitals have enrolled in the MedMARx
        program and other progressive hospitals and health systems are joining rapidly. Profiles
        of the participants show that hospitals of various types and sizes spanning fewer than 50
        beds to approximately 1000 beds are enrolled. MedMARx hospitals include institutions of
        the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense, and state-owned
        facilities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The USP commitment to MedMARx is broader than merely
        collecting data. In the coming year, USP will enroll champion hospitals participating in
        MedMARx in a long-term project to propose indicators of quality in the medication use
        process and to identify best <u>practice</u> standards and best <u>process </u>standards
        for the medication-use system.</font></p>
        <b><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;A Recommendation for Congressional Action </font></p>
        </b><p><font face="Arial" size="2">USP is heartened by the national attention resulting
        from release of the Institute of Medicine Report&#151;<i>To Err is Human&#151;Building a
        Safer Health System</i>.&quot; USP is particularly gratified at the immediate action being
        taken by the House Commerce Committee&#146;s Subcommittees on Health and Environment and
        Oversight and Investigations and the House Committee on Veterans&#146; Affairs
        Subcommittee on Health. We are pleased to offer the following specific recommendations:<b>
        </font><ul>
          </b>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Focus Attention on the Quality of Health Care System</font></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the first step in preventing medication errors, the
          priority should be on fixing the system, not the blame. The IOM report is clear that
          mandatory programs at state and federal levels have not effectively captured the full
          number of errors occurring. The report argues that the public needs some assurance of a
          minimum level of protection (i.e., through reporting, investigations and follow-up) and
          that health care organizations need to be &quot;incentivized&quot; to improve patient
          safety. In fact, mandatory reporting could provide a false sense of protection if the
          mandatory programs are no more effective than those already in existence. Therefore,
          perhaps the question at this time should be: &quot;What needs to be done to improve the
          quality of healthcare systems that will provide these assurances and incentives?&quot;
          Numbers and statistics from such mandatory programs may not be as useful to the public
          and, in fact, may erode the confidence of the public if shear numbers are used as a gauge
          of quality. What confidence can a citizen have in the health care system when the error
          profiles for both (or maybe the only) rural hospital(s) in their area show that harmful
          errors have occurred there? &quot;To Err Is Human&quot; leads us to believe that no
          hospital is likely to be error free. The fact that a harmful error has not yet occurred in
          a facility is no assurance that it will not occur, or that it has, in fact, occurred but
          has not been recognized as such or reported. To better serve the public, it would be far
          more useful to have the knowledge and assurance that the hospital has adopted safer
          processes and best practices when errors have occurred in order to reduce the possibility
          of errors. We believe a system that provides a public indicator that these best practices
          are adopted, in effect a facility&#146;s &quot;report card,&quot; would be a more
          effective tool for consumers to help choose the best and safest health care facilities for
          themselves and their families.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A national voluntary reporting system ensuring
          confidentiality in support of the above framework should help accomplish this by reporting
          and documenting actions taken in response to an error. A more robust database will also
          provide opportunities for risk prevention and designing error out of medication use
          processes. As an incentive to report, information submitted to the system should be
          treated as privileged per federal statute as is currently the case in states that provide
          for peer-review protection. What should be mandated for hospitals and other healthcare
          facilities is not reporting, per se, but the development of quality control systems (of
          which reporting is a part) that implement these best practices and improvements to prevent
          and correct system weaknesses. For example, the federal government can create a public
          report card using the inspection and survey processes of state boards of pharmacy, HCFA,
          and JCAHO. Incentives for facilities can be provided by third party payers and insurers
          that require the adoption of such standards and practices into every healthcare system as
          a contingency of reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid programs.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, under all circumstances, every victim and/or the
          family should have the legal right to be told by the health care professional or facility
          if an error has been committed in the deliverance of their care that has resulted in harm
          to the patient, increased hospitalization, or medical or therapeutic intervention. </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Protect the Confidentiality of Data Submitted to National
            Voluntary Reporting Programs</font></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Among the IOM Report&#146;s discussions and recommendations
          is recognition that the absence of federal or state protection from disclosure of
          medication error reported information poses a major barrier to voluntary reporting of
          errors, or potential errors. Health care practitioners are concerned about reprisals and
          practitioners and health care institutions and delivery systems are concerned about
          liability. USP believes, therefore, that Congress can make a significant contribution to
          the development and successful implementations of systems that facilitate voluntary
          medication error reporting and tracking through immediate consideration of legislation
          that would protect information developed in connection with error reporting by hospitals
          and other institutions and health care settings. USP currently is developing such
          legislative language for House and Senate consideration. </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <b><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Conclusion </font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In closing, I wish to assure Committee and Subcommittee
        members that USP shares with Congress the goal of a safe medication use system. USP has
        made a public and long-term commitment to working proactively with all stakeholders toward
        that goal. We particularly look forward to working with Congressional leadership on the
        issue of fostering effective systems that support best practices, accountability, and
        confidentiality to stimulate<b> </b>greater reporting, analysis, and system changes to
        prevent medication and medical errors and to ensure confidence in our health care delivery
        system.</font></p>
