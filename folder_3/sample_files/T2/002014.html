          <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-align:justify;
">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission’s mission was to study the United States mental 
            health service delivery system, including both private and public 
            sector providers.&nbsp; The Commission advised the President on methods 
            to improve the system.&nbsp; The Commission’s goal was to recommend 
            improvements that will enable adults with a serious mental illness 
            and children with a serious emotional disturbance to live, work, learn, 
            and participate fully in their communities.&nbsp; <span style="color:blue"><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/04/20020429-2.html" target="_top">Link

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;A.&nbsp;From June 2002 through April 2003, 
            the Commission solicited public comment from stakeholders in the mental 
            health community. The purpose of obtaining public comment was to assist 
            the Commission in formulating an action plan for the President that 
            would improve America's mental health service delivery system.<br>
            The Commission received comments, personal stories and recommendations 
            from nearly 2,500 persons who submitted comments via this website, 
            letters, e-mail, and in-person testimony.&nbsp; Comments were made 
            by consumers, parents, family members, advocates, service providers, 
            educators, researchers, and other concerned individuals.<s> </s></p>
