<p> ABLE Radiometry / Vegetation State</h1>
<img src="gif/titlebar.gif"><br>
<p>
    <h2>General Purpose</h2>

A number of half-hour average radiation measurements (PAR, net radiation, solar insolation, and 
solar albedo) are made continuously at two ABLE sites (Whitewater and Smileyberg), plus MSR/LAI 
measurements are made approximately every two weeks during the growing season at Smileyberg, 
Whitewater, and Brainerd.
<p>
These measurements provide valuable ground truth data for modelling efforts using satellite 
derived remote sensing information.

<h2><a name="Primary_Quantities_Measured_with_System">Primary Quantities Measured with System</a></h2>
<p>
All measurements are made at 1 Hz frequency (except on the Smileyberg AWS system; 2 Hz) and averaged 
to 30 minute values. The measurements are considered to be representative of the grassland areas at 
their respective locations.
<p>
Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR):
<p>
This measurement (made with a silicon cell pyranometer) in the 400-700 nm waveband provides 
information on the intensity of radiation used by photosynthetic processes in plants.
<p>
Net Radiation:
<p>
Net radiation is the measurement of the difference in downwelling and upwelling broadband radiation
(short wave and long wave). A net radiometer is used to make this measurement.
<p>
Albedo:
<p>
Albedo is the measurement of the difference in shortwave solar insolation and reflected shortwave energy from
the surface. An albedometer is used to make this measurement.
<p>
Solar Insolation:
<p>
Solar Insolation is the measuerment of shortwave solar insolation. The upper portion of an albedometer 
is used to make this measurement.
<p>
Surface temperature:
<p>
The temperature of the canopy surface is measured with three co-located (Whitewater only) infrared
temperature sensors aimed to the NW, NE, and SE.
<p> 
Canopy Reflectance:
<p>
The canopy reflectance is measured to determine the reflectance of various solar wavelengths. 
A multispectral radiometer is used to perform this measurement at multiple locations.
<p>
Leaf Area Index:
<p>
Leaf area index is an important measurement reflecting the canopy structure and thus it's ability to
intercept radiation. A PAR sensor is used to perform this measurement at multiple locations.

PAR: 
<p>
PAR is measured by the AWS systems at Smileyberg and Whitewater and is output as part of the AWS datastream. 
<p>
Net Radiation:
<p>
Net radiation is measured by the EBBR station at Whitewater and output as part of the EBBR datastream.
Net radiation is measured by the AWS system at Smileyberg and output as part of the AWS datastream.
Net radiometers are ventilated to reduce loss of data from dew and frost and to reduce the effects of
wind on the measurement. 
<p>
Albedo:
<p>
Albedo is measured by the AWS systems at Whitewater and Smileyberg and output as part of the AWS datastream.
<p>
Solar Insolation:
<p>
Solar insolation is measured by the AWS systems at Whitewater and Smileyberg and output as part of the AWS datastream.
<p>
Surface Temperature:
<p>
Surface temperature is measured with three infrared temperature transducers mounted on the TDR box
infrastructure and are output by a CR10X datalogger that also logs precipitation.
<p>
Canopy Reflectance and Leaf Area Index: 
<p>
Canopy reflectance and Leaf area index are measured approximately every two weeks during the growing season
at Smileyberg, Whitewater, and Brainerd.  This process requires that multiple measurements be made in 
clear sky conditions at around noon solar time.

<p>
All measurements, except the MSR/LAI, are performed and logged by Campbell Scientific, Inc. CR10X dataloggers.
Most radiometric instruments require periodic cleaning of their domes and replacement of dessicant.  
The ventilation of the net radiometers must be maintained to reduce the loss of data from dew and frost 
and to reduce the effects of wind on the measurement.  Periodic calibration checks (every two years) of the 
radiometric sensors are made to ensure that calibrations have not changed. Bird detterrent spikes have been 
added to some of the radiometers to try to reduce soiling and puncturing (of the plastic net radiometer
domes especially).
