March 2005

1. PURPOSE 
The purpose of this report is to identify and document the nuclear safety design requirements that 
are specific to structures, systems, and components (SSCs) of the repository that are important to 
safety (ITS) during the preclosure period and to support the preclosure safety analysis and the 
license application for the high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repository at Yucca Mountain, 
Nevada. The scope of this report includes the assignment of nuclear safety design requirements 
to SSCs that are ITS and does not include the assignment of design requirements to SSCs or 
natural or engineered barriers that are important to waste isolation (ITWI). 
These requirements are used as input for the design of the SSCs that are ITS such that the 
preclosure performance objectives of 10 CFR 63.111 [DIRS 156605] are met. The natural or 
engineered barriers that are important to meeting the postclosure performance objectives 
of 10 CFR 63.113 [DIRS 156605] are identified as ITWI. Although a structure, system, or 
component (SSC) that is ITS may also be ITWI, this report is only concerned with providing the 
nuclear safety requirements for SSCs that are ITS to prevent or mitigate event sequences during 
the repository preclosure period. 
2. QUALITY ASSURANCE 
As established using information presented in Section 2 of Quality Assurance Requirements and 
Description (DOE 2004 [DIRS 171539]), this report is subject to quality assurance program

4.2 CRITERIA 
Federal Regulations 
The safety classification criteria used in this report are based on the performance objectives 
stated in 10 CFR 63.111 [DIRS 156605]. Transportation casks received at the repository comply 
with requirements of 10 CFR 71.55 [DIRS 104091], which states that casks are to be subcritical 
even with most reactive credible configuration of fissile material and moderation to the most 
reactive credible extent, and the design bases of 10 CFR 71.73 [DIRS 104091]. Event sequence 
categorization methodology is based on the 10 CFR 63.2 definition of event sequence. 
5. ASSUMPTIONS 
5.1 System architecture is established by “Facility, Equipment and System Names for Use in 
the SAR” (Lucas 2004 [DIRS 170073]). Rationale: This input is appropriate for use 
because it represents the latest design information and system architecture available for 
this report. 
5.2 Although the Remediation Facility is included in the system architecture provided in 
Lucas (2004 [DIRS 170073]), it is assumed to be included as an integral part of the DTF 
and will not exist as a separate facility. Rationale: The Remediation Facility is 
integrated within the DTF and provides the space, layout, structures, and embedded 
systems needed to recover from off-normal conditions during waste-handling operations 
(e.g., a damaged transportation cask, fuel form, or waste package [WP]).

6. ANALYSIS 
6.1 METHOD 
A distinction is made between the repository design bases and the 10 CFR 63.2 [DIRS 156605] 
design bases for SSCs that are ITS. All SSCs have design bases; however, only SSCs that are 
ITS have design bases as defined by 10 CFR 63.2. These 10 CFR 63.2 design bases are required, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 63.112 [DIRS 156605], to be included in the preclosure safety analysis of 
the license application for a repository at Yucca Mountain. 
The preclosure safety analysis of the license application provides a safety assessment of the 
10 CFR 63.2 repository design bases. The 10 CFR 63.2 design bases and the supporting design 
information are subjected to design control and the other quality assurance criteria of 10 CFR 
63.142 [DIRS 156605]. 
The methodology for developing the 10 CFR 63.2 design bases are summarized in the following 
paragraphs. 
The Category 1, Category 2, and Beyond Category 2 event sequences derived from the internal, 
external, and other applicable hazards analyses (such as fire hazards analysis, aircraft crash 
hazards analysis, etc.) are identified. The list of Category 1, Category 2, and Beyond Category 2 
event sequences form a part of the repository licensing bases and appear in the license 
application. Each Category 1, Category 2, and Beyond Category 2 event sequence involves 
SSCs that are evaluated within the preclosure safety analysis to assess the likelihood and 
consequences of an event sequence leading to a dose that exceeds the 10 CFR Part 63 [DIRS 
156605] preclosure performance objectives. These SSCs may change as the design matures. 
Changes in the list of event sequences result in a reassessment of affected SSCs and associated 
10 CFR 63.2 design bases. Design iterations, design improvements, or design modifications 
could potentially lead to changes in the list of event sequences and associated SSCs throughout 
the licensing process and beyond. 
Compliance with the 10 CFR Part 63 performance objectives for Category 1 and Category 2 
event sequences is significantly different for each category. Category 1 event sequence 
compliance assessments are based on annual performance requirements that require an 
aggregation of releases. A Category 2 event sequence compliance assessment is made on a perevent 
basis. No aggregation of releases is made for Category 2 event sequences. Because of 
these compliance differences, the design bases for SSCs that are ITS involved in Category 2 
event sequences are developed before the design bases associated with the Category 1 event 
sequences. ITS SSCs may be required to ensure that an event sequence is categorized as Beyond 
Category 2. 
The set of SSCs that has been classified as ITS based on the Category 1 and Category 2 event 
sequences is identified. In addition, those SSCs credited for ensuring that an event sequence is 
categorized as Beyond Category 2 are identified. These SSCs that have been classified as ITS 
require 10 CFR 63.2 design bases to be established. 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 5 March 2005 
A single SSC is then chosen from the set of SSCs classified as ITS and the Category 1, 
Category 2, and Beyond Category 2 event sequences that credit the function of that SSC are 
identified from the applicable supporting analyses. 
For the selected SSC that is ITS, the Category 2 and Beyond Category 2 10 CFR 63.2 design 
bases are developed. This selection process is repeated until the SSCs that are ITS have 
10 CFR 63.2 design bases developed for each of the Category 2 and Beyond Category 2 event 
sequences. 
After the design bases for the Category 2 and Beyond Category 2 event sequences are identified, 
an SSC that is ITS for meeting the Category 1 performance objective is selected. The 10 CFR 
63.2 design bases for the SSC that is ITS that meet the 10 CFR Part 63 preclosure performance 
objectives for Category 1 event sequences are then selected. This process is repeated until 
10 CFR 63.2 design bases are established for the SSCs that are ITS in the Category 1 event 
sequences. 
6.2 ARCHITECTURE 
The repository is comprised of the following facilities (Lucas 2004 [DIRS 170073]): 
1. Balance of Plant Facility 
2. Canister Handling Facility (CHF) 
3. DTF 
4. Fuel Handling Facility (FHF) 
5. Subsurface Facility 
6. Transportation Cask Receipt and Return Facility (TCRRF) 
7. Warehouse and Non-Nuclear Receipt Facility (WNNRF). 
Although the Remediation Facility is included in the system architecture provided in “Facility, 
Equipment and System Names for Use in the SAR” (Lucas 2004 [DIRS 170073]), it has since 
been included as an integral part of the DTF and does not exist as a separate facility 
(Assumption 5.2). 
Repository systems are subdivided into process systems and infrastructure systems. Process 
systems include systems that involve primary processes in the waste handling and waste isolation 
systems while the infrastructure systems are those systems that are needed to provide support to 
the process systems and the facilities. Process and infrastructure systems exist and operate in 
multiple facilities. 
The repository waste handling systems are evaluated to determine the applicability of 
Category 1, Category 2, and Beyond Category 2 event sequences associated with preclosure 
operations (BSC 2005b [DIRS 171429]). The Balance of Plant facilities have no Category 1, 
Category 2, or Beyond Category 2 event sequences associated with preclosure operations (BSC 
2005b [DIRS 171429]). The remaining repository facilities and the repository process systems 
that are present in these facilities include the following (Lucas 2004 [DIRS 170073]):

The applicable repository facility and process system SSCs provided in this report are presented 
with their corresponding 10 CFR 63.2 design bases. 
6.3 CATEGORIZATION OF EVENT SEQUENCES 
An event sequence is defined by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be “a series of 
actions and/or occurrences within the natural and engineered components of a geologic 
repository operations area that could potentially lead to exposure of individuals to radiation” (10 
CFR 63.2). Event sequences that are “expected to occur one or more times before permanent 
closure of the geologic repository operations area are referred to as Category 1 event sequences” 
(10 CFR 63.2). “Other event sequences that have at least one chance in 10,000 of occurring 
before permanent closure are referred to as Category 2 event sequences” (10 CFR 63.2). Less 
likely event sequences are considered Beyond Category 2. An event that has no potential for 
“exposure of individuals to radiation” is not considered an event sequence. 
The initial step of the process for determining the 10 CFR Part 63.2 design bases involves 
determining the Category 1, Category 2, and Beyond Category 2 event sequences. These event 
sequences are identified in the internal, external, and other applicable hazards analyses. 
Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 171429]) 
establishes the categorization (as Category 1, Category 2, or Beyond Category 2) of the internal 
and external event sequences that may occur before permanent closure of the repository at Yucca 
Mountain. 
6.4 CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURES, SYSTEMS, AND COMPONENTS 
Safety Classification of SSCs and Barriers (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668]) establishes the safety 
classification of the repository SSCs. If an SSC is determined to be ITS or ITWI, then it is 
classified as safety category (SC). An SSC can be ITS, ITWI, both, or neither. If an SSC is 
neither ITS nor ITWI, it is classified as Non-SC. The safety classifications of the repository 
SSCs, as established in Safety Classification of SSCs and Barriers (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668]), 
are reproduced in the tables found in Appendix A of this analysis. The set of SSCs that have 
been classified as ITS based on the Category 1 and Category 2 event sequences, as well as those 
SSCs credited for ensuring that an event sequence is categorized as Beyond Category 2, are 
identified. 
6.5 EVENT SEQUENCE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS 
The worker and offsite radiation doses were calculated in Preclosure Consequence Analyses for 
License Application (BSC 2005c [DIRS 171607], Section 7) for the event sequences identified in 
Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 171429], 
Section 7). In addition, any mitigative functions performed by ITS SSCs that are credited in the 
dose calculations are identified (such as high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filters). 
6.6 DEVELOPMENT OF DESIGN BASES 
The development of the 10 CFR 63.2 design bases follows the methodology described in Section 
6.1 using the inputs described in Section 4.1. 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 8 March 2005 
The repository facilities, and the repository process systems that are present in these facilities, 
are listed in the following subsections based on the repository architecture described in Section 
6.2. The facilities and systems that have Category 1 or Category 2 event sequences that require 
SSCs to perform prevention or mitigation functions are identified. In some instances, 10 CFR 
63.2 design bases are developed for SSCs that provide prevention functions to ensure that the 
frequency of an event sequence is Beyond Category 2. 
The 10 CFR 63.2 design bases (the nuclear safety design bases) for the repository facilities, 
systems, subsystems, and selected SSCs that are developed using the methodology described in 
Section 6.1 are presented in Tables A-I and A-II of Appendix A. 
6.6.1 Waste Handling Area Facilities 
The repository facilities include the following: the Balance of Plant Facility, CHF, DTF, FHF, 
Subsurface Facility, TCRRF, and the WNNRF (Lucas 2004 [DIRS 170073]). The safety 
categories for these facilities are shown in Attachment A of Safety Classification of SSCs and 
Barriers (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668]). 
6.6.1.1 Balance of Plant Facility 
As established by Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 
171429], Section 7), there are no Category 1 or Category 2 event sequences that require SSCs in 
the facilities that comprise the Balance of Plant Facility to perform prevention or mitigation 
functions. The switchgear facility contains portions of the electrical power system that are ITS. 
Although the structure contains ITS components, there are no event sequences identified that 
prevent the ITS components from performing their ITS function. No Balance of Plant facility is 
required to function to protect an ITS or ITWI SSC or natural or engineered barrier. The safety 
category of the system is Non-SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). There are no 
nuclear safety design bases associated with the Balance of Plant Facility. 
6.6.1.2 Canister Handling Facility 
As established by Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 
171429], Section 7), there are Category 2 event sequences that could occur in this facility and 
there are features of the facility that are ITS for prevention or mitigation of event sequences. The 
Seismic Analysis for Preclosure Safety (BSC 2004a [DIRS 171470], Attachment III) has 
identified potential seismically initiated failures that could lead to undesired consequences. This 
facility contains SSCs that are ITS; it does not contain SSCs or natural or engineered barriers that 
are ITWI. The safety category of this facility is SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). 
Table A-I in Appendix A presents the nuclear safety design bases associated with the CHF. 
6.6.1.3 Dry Transfer Facility 
As established by Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 
171429], Section 7) and Preclosure Consequence Analysis for License Application (BSC 2005c 
[DIRS 171607], Section 7), there are Category 1 and Category 2 event sequences that could 
occur in this facility and there are features of the facility that are ITS for prevention or mitigation 
of event sequences. Seismic Analysis for Preclosure Safety (BSC 2004a [DIRS 171470], 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 9 March 2005 
Attachment III) has identified potential seismically initiated failures that could lead to undesired 
consequences. This facility contains SSCs that are ITS; it does not contain SSCs or natural or 
engineered barriers that are ITWI. The safety category of this facility is SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 
171668], Attachment A). Table A-I in Appendix A presents the nuclear safety design bases 
associated with the DTF. 
6.6.1.4 Fuel Handling Facility 
As established by Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 
171429], Section 7) and the Preclosure Consequence Analysis for License Application (BSC 
2005c [DIRS 171607], Section 7), there are Category 1 and Category 2 event sequences that 
could occur in this facility and there are features of the facility that are ITS for prevention or 
mitigation of event sequences. The Seismic Analysis for Preclosure Safety (BSC 2004a [DIRS 
171470], Attachment III) has identified potential seismically initiated failures that could lead to 
undesired consequences. This facility contains SSCs that are ITS; it does not contain SSCs or 
natural or engineered barriers that are ITWI. The safety category of this facility is SC (BSC 
2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). Table A-I in Appendix A presents the nuclear safety 
design bases associated with the FHF. 
6.6.1.5 Subsurface Facility 
The Subsurface Facility consists of the emplacement drifts, subsurface development, and 
postemplacement subsystems (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Section 6.3.1.5). In this report, the 
Subsurface Facility and its three component subsystems are considered separately in the 
development of nuclear safety design bases. 
The size and layout of the emplacement drifts component of the Subsurface Facility ensure that 
performance complies with rockfall modeling (preclosure and postclosure) and drift modeling 
(postclosure) because they provide the rock properties and emplacement drifts layout and 
dimensions for the rockfall analysis. The size and layout of drifts is both ITS and ITWI. 
Nonemplacement openings of the Subsurface Facility provide the size properties consistent with 
rockfall modeling for preclosure. A change of the size of the nonemplacement openings may 
allow a larger rockfall that could breach WPs as they are transported through the openings. 
Thus, the nonemplacement openings component is ITS. The safety category of the Subsurface 
Facility is SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). 
The emplacement drifts excavated openings component of the emplacement drift subsystem are 
ITS and ITWI because they provide the rock properties and emplacement drift layout dimensions 
for the rockfall analyses used in preclosure safety analyses and postclosure performance 
confirmation (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). The WP emplacement pallet 
component of the emplacement drift subsystem is ITS and ITWI for providing structural support 
to protect the WP from damage during surface handling operations and transport to, and into, an 
emplacement drift. During the preclosure and postclosure periods, the WP emplacement pallet 
provides support to the WP should a seismic event occur. The safety category of the 
emplacement drift subsystem is SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). There is no 
Category 1 or Category 2 event sequence that requires SSCs in the emplacement drift subsystem 
to perform prevention or mitigation functions (BSC 2005b [DIRS 171429], Section 7). The 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 10 March 2005 
Seismic Analysis for Preclosure Safety (BSC 2004a [DIRS 171470], Attachment III) has 
identified potential seismically initiated failures that could lead to undesired consequences. 
The postemplacement subsystem and its closure functions during postclosure are ITWI. 
This subsystem does not include ITS SSCs; it does include ITWI SSCs. The safety category of 
this subsystem is SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). There is no Category 1 or 
Category 2 event sequence that requires SSCs in the postemplacement subsystem to perform 
preclosure prevention or mitigation functions (BSC 2005b [DIRS 171429], Section 7). 
The subsurface development subsystem does not contain spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or HLW. 
There is no Category 1 or Category 2 event sequence that requires SSCs in this subsystem to 
perform prevention or mitigation functions (BSC 2005b [DIRS 171429], Section 7). Therefore, 
this subsystem does not include ITS SSCs or ITWI SSCs or natural or engineered barriers. The 
safety category of this system is Non-SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). 
The nuclear safety design bases associated with the Subsurface Facility and its subsystems are 
presented in Table A-I in Appendix A. 
6.6.1.6 Transportation Cask Receipt/Return Facility 
As established by Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 
171429], Section 7), Category 2 event sequences could occur in the TCRRF and there are 
features of the facility that are ITS for prevention or mitigation of event sequences. The Seismic 
Analysis for Preclosure Safety (BSC 2004a [DIRS 171470], Attachment III) has identified 
potential seismically initiated failures that could lead to undesired consequences. This facility 
contains SSCs that are ITS; it does not contain SSCs or natural or engineered barriers that are 
ITWI. The safety category of this facility is SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). 
Table A-I in Appendix A presents the nuclear safety design bases associated with the TCRRF. 
6.6.1.7 Warehouse and Non-Nuclear Receipt Facility 
As established by Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 
171429], Section 7), there are no Category 1 or Category 2 event sequences that require SSCs in 
the WNNRF to perform prevention or mitigation functions. Therefore, this facility consists of no 
SSCs that are ITS or SSCs or natural or engineered barriers that are ITWI. The safety category 
of this facility is Non-SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). 
6.6.2 Waste Process and Infrastructure Systems 
6.6.2.1 Cask/MSC/WP Preparation System 
As established by Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application (BSC 2005b [DIRS 
171429], Section 7), there are Category 2 event sequences that could occur in this system and 
there are features of the system that are ITS for prevention or mitigation of event sequences. The 
Seismic Analysis for Preclosure Safety (BSC 2004a [DIRS 171470], Attachment III) has 
identified potential seismically initiated failures that could lead to undesired consequences. This 
system contains SSCs that are ITS; it does not contain SSCs or natural or engineered barriers that 
are ITWI. The safety category of this system is SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668] Attachment A).

6.7 OTHER ITEMS IMPORTANT TO SAFETY 
The transportation casks, standardized U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) SNF disposable 
canisters, DOE HLW canisters, DOE multicanister overpacks (MCOs), the naval SNF canisters, 
and the dual-purpose canisters (DPCs) are ITS, but are not a part of the repository architecture 
(Lucas 2004 [DIRS 170073]). In the Categorization of Event Sequences for License Application 
analysis (BSC 2005b [DIRS 171429], Section 7) it was established that a breach of a 
transportation cask with impact limiters installed is a Beyond Category 2 event sequence based 
on the 10 CFR 71.55 [DIRS 104091] and 10 CFR 71.73 [DIRS 104091] design requirements for 
the transportation casks (BSC 2005b [DIRS 171429], Section 7). A breach of a DOE MCO or a 
standardized DOE SNF canister is a Beyond Category 2 event sequence based on the acceptance 
requirements of the Waste Acceptance System Requirements Document (DOE 2002 [DIRS 
158873], Section 4.3.7). A breach of the DOE HLW canister, naval SNF canister, or DPC as a 
result of a credible fire is a Beyond Category 2 event sequence (BSC 2004c [DIRS 171488], 
Section 5). 
To ensure that transportation casks with impact limiters installed and that standardized DOE 
SNF canisters are capable of withstanding drops within the design basis without breach, they 
have been designated as ITS and classified as SC (BSC 2005a [DIRS 171668], Attachment A). 
Table A-II in Appendix A presents the nuclear safety design bases associated with transportation 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 17 March 2005 
casks, DOE HLW canisters, DOE MCOs, naval SNF canisters, standardized DOE SNF canisters, 
and DPCs. 
7. CONCLUSIONS 
The 10 CFR 63.2 design bases (nuclear safety design bases) selected in this report using the 
methodology presented in Section 6.1 are listed in Appendix A. These nuclear safety design 
bases are used as input to the design of the repository. These output results are reasonable 
compared to the input and are suitable for their intended use. As the design of the repository 
proceeds and further event sequences and consequence analyses of hazards are performed, this 
report will be reviewed for impact and revised as necessary.

FOOTNOTES: 
1. Functions of the transportation casks are credited to prevent or mitigate event sequences. The certification process for transportation casks under 10 CFR Part 
71 [DIRS 104091] considers severe transportation accident conditions and conditions of normal transport. The precedent that licensed casks provide adequate 
protection against all hazards that apply during the transportation phase establishes the basis that the casks will continue to provide adequate protection on site at 
the repository. 
2. This requirement may be equivalently replaced by a set of two sub-requirements. The first sub-requirement is the fire requirement applicable to the waste form 
being sheltered by the waste form container. The second sub-requirement is as follows: the severity of the fire should be controlled such that the waste form 
container does not lose its structural integrity when handled (BSC 2004c [DIRS 171488], Section 6.2.2) 
3. The definitions of the Safety Functions are provided in Appendix B. 
4. Transportation casks must meet the flame emissivity and cask absorptivity requirements of 10 CFR 71.73(c)(4). 
5. Analyses, as appropriate, will be performed on the respective cask/canister/waste form to demonstrate that the cask, canister, and/or waste form does not fail 
as a result of the credible fire in all areas where it is handled. 
6. Analyses will confirm that sealed WPs shall withstand drops onto energy-absorbing crush pads without breaching and that the impact consequences associated 
with a drop of a canister or cask onto energy-absorbing crush pads shall be equal to, or less than, the impact consequences associated with the drop of a cask or 
canister from the maximum specified drop height onto an unyielding surface. 
7. The naval SNF canister will not be exposed to fire conditions more severe than those corresponding to a black body gas exposure flux of 50 kW/m2 and a 
temperature of 1000°C (1832°F) for 2 minutes. (BSC 2004c Sections 5.1.2.8 and 6.2.1.2.6) 
GENERAL NOTES: 
Lift height limits can be exceeded provided that energy-absorbing material is used to limit the impact energy to that of the drop height limit. 
The load drop probability includes components (lifting yokes, trunnions, and grapples) associated with the lifting and transferring of heavy loads. 
The trolley system includes the trolley, rails, pedestal, and control system.

APPENDIX B 
DEFINITION OF SAFETY FUNCTIONS 
B.1 General 
Each SSC that is ITS that is credited in the prevention or mitigation of a seismically initiated 
event sequence is assigned a safety function (or functions) with regard to performance goals for 
the specific SSC during and after the initiating seismic event. This appendix defines the safety 
functions used in this report. These definitions of safety functions were obtained from Seismic 
Analysis for Preclosure Safety (BSC 2004a [DIRS 171470], Section 4). 
B.1.1 Safety Function: No Structural Collapse 
The “no structural collapse” safety function is assigned to facilities and structures assigned to 
either a DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. For seismic margin calculations, the function corresponds 
approximately to the state of “large permanent distortion, short of collapse” of a structure or 
facility, termed Limit State A. 
The “no structural collapse” safety function has the following performance goals during and after 
a seismic event: 
• No structural collapse occurs (i.e., column and support members remain upright, 
beams remain functional, and walls remain standing), and failure of the contents is 
not serious enough to cause severe injury or death, prevent evacuation, or induce a 
breach of a waste container. 
• Confinement of internal airflow is not required and may not be maintained. 
Concrete walls will remain standing, but may be extensively cracked; they may not 
maintain pressure differential with normal HVAC. Cracks will still provide a 
tortuous path for material release. The largest cracks are expected to be no greater 
than one-half in. 
• Distortion of the structure will be limited, but expected to be visible to the naked 
eye. 
• Components will remain anchored, but with no assurance that they will remain 
functional or easily repairable. 
An additional requirement of this safety function is that the failure of adjacent structures and 
other SSCs (whether ITS or not) shall be considered in seismic analyses, as appropriate, and 
shall not induce collapse of the designated structure. 
B.1.2 Safety Function: No Drop 
The “no drop” safety function is assigned to cranes assigned to a DBGM-2 level. The no-drop 
safety function has the following performance goals during and after a seismic event: 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 B-2 March 2005 
• The crane shall not release (or drop) a waste container or waste form either due to 
failure of crane components or controls due to a designated seismic event. 
• The crane, as a system, shall not collapse or fall down. The crane shall remain on 
its track or guide system (regardless if crane is holding a waste container or waste 
form at the time of the event). 
• Horizontal movement (swinging) of the cask or WP shall be restrained (if 
necessary) to preclude impacts with nearby walls and barriers. 
• The crane track or guide system shall remain intact and attached to the structure. It 
may be distorted and bent, however. 
• The crane shall not move in an uncontrolled manner or exceed its design speed 
limit. 
B.1.3 Safety Function: No Breach 
The “no breach” safety function is assigned to various waste containers assigned to either a 
DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. 
The no breach (leak tight) safety function has the following performance goals during and after a 
seismic event: 
• Containment of the waste form is maintained and no release or dispersement of 
radionuclides (either as gas or particulates) to the environment occurs. 
• Distortion and damage of the container will be limited. 
B.1.4 Safety Function: No Tipover 
The “no tipover” safety function is assigned to various SSCs handling casks and canisters (e.g., 
turntables and pedestals) assigned to either a DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. The no tipover safety 
function has the following performance goal during and after a seismic event: 
• The SSC shall not allow a tipover of a cask or canister (i.e., an overturn from an 
upright or normal position and impact the floor, ground, or other object), or tilting 
of the cask or canister resulting in an impact with an adjacent SCC that is ITS 
causing a domino effect. 
B.1.5 Safety Function: No Slapdown 
The “no slapdown” safety function is assigned to various SSCs handling casks and canisters 
(e.g., trolleys, WP transporters, transport locomotives, horizontal aging modules, site-specific 
cask transporters) assigned to either a DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. The no slapdown safety 
function has the following performance goals during and after a seismic event: 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 B-3 March 2005 
• The SSC shall not allow a slapdown or rapid drop of a cask or WP in transit (i.e., 
the fall of a cask or WP, a vertical distance and subsequent impact onto the floor, 
ground, or onto another object). 
• Any impacts to the cask or WP shall be within design specifications and, thereby, 
not induce a breach of the cask or WP in transit. 
• The SSC itself may sustain substantial damage and may no longer be operable. 
B.1.6 Safety Function: No Release 
The “no release” safety function is assigned to staging and storage racks assigned to either a 
DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. 
The no release safety function has the following performance goals during and after a seismic 
event: 
• No release or dispersement of radionuclides (either as gas and/or as particulates) to 
the environment due to shaking or deformation of the waste form or storage rack. 
• Distortion and damage of the waste form and rack(s) will be limited and will not 
preclude additional operations to retrieve the waste forms. 
B.1.7 Safety Function: No Failure 
The “no failure” safety function is assigned to various SSCs (e.g., limiters, collars, dampers) 
assigned to either a DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. The no failure safety function has the following 
performance goal during and after a seismic event: 
• The SSC will continue its designated safety function after a seismic event without 
significant degradation in the performance or requirement for repair. For structural 
elements, the load response shall be essentially elastic due to the seismic event. 
B.1.8 Safety Function: No Significant Cracking/Displacement 
The “no significant cracking/displacement” safety function is assigned to aging pads at the 
DBGM-2 level. The no significant cracking/displacement safety function has the following 
performance goals during and after a seismic event: 
• Aging pad is essentially intact. The concrete will remain structurally sound, but 
may contain several small cracks. The largest cracks are expected to be no greater 
than one-eighth in. and lengths shorter than 2 ft. 
• Distortion of the pad will be very limited and not expected to be immediately 
apparent to the naked eye. 
• Differential displacement across the pad shall be minimal, with differential 
displacements insufficient to cause a tipover of individual storage casks. 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 B-4 March 2005 
B.1.9 Safety Function: Controlled Failure 
The “controlled failure” safety function is assigned in special instances to SSCs (e.g., ventilation 
stacks) to preclude potential interactions with SSCs that are ITS. The controlled failure safety 
function has the following performance goals for ventilation stacks during and after a seismic 
event: 
• Failure of an SSC due to a seismic event shall not obstruct an open flow path to the 
environment of the corresponding ventilation system. 
• Failure of an SSC shall not impede the safety function of another SSC that is ITS. 
B.1.10 Safety Function: Shielding Integrity Remains Intact 
The “shielding integrity remains intact” safety function is assigned to shielding SSCs (e.g., shield 
view ports, shield windows, shield doors) at the DBGM-1 and DBGM-2 levels. The shielding 
integrity remains intact safety function has the following performance goals during and after a 
seismic event: 
• The SSC remains essentially intact and in-place, and provides sufficient (direct 
shine) shielding to permit workers to egress the area without receiving a significant 
dose (“significant” is defined as less than 10 percent of the worker dose limit). 
• Cracking of glass will be limited, and drainage of fluids (used in ports and windows 
for shielding) will be slow. 
B.1.11 Safety Function: Maintain Waste Form 
The “maintain waste form” safety function is assigned to fuel handling machines at either the 
DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. The maintain waste form safety function has the following 
performance goals during and after a seismic event: 
• The SSC continues to maintain (retain) the waste form. 
• The waste form remains intact and in-place. 
• Damage to the waste form is minimal. 
• Significant release or dispersement of radionuclides (either as gas and/or as 
particulates) to the environment due to shaking or deformation of the waste form is 
precluded.

B.1.12 Safety Function: No Criticality 
The “no criticality” safety function is assigned to various waste containers (e.g., casks, canisters, 
WPs) and staging and storage racks assigned to DBGM-2 level. 
For various waste containers, the no criticality safety function has the following performance 
goals during and after a seismic event: 
• The waste in the container shall remain nuclear subcritical as a result of a drop or 
impact within design limits with the most reactive credible configuration of the 
fissile material and moderation to the most reactive credible extent. 
• The container internal geometry shall retain the design waste configuration with 
only minor damage/distortion. 
For staging and storage racks, the no criticality safety function has the following performance 
goal during and after a seismic event: 
• The rack shall remain structurally intact (with minimal distortion of the rack) and 
prevent bare fuel assemblies (or other exposed waste forms) to become nuclear 
critical as a result, considering the most reactive credible configuration of the fissile 
material and moderation to the most reactive credible extent. 
B.1.13 Safety Function: No Runaway 
The “no runaway” (uncontrolled descent) safety function is assigned to transporters and 
locomotives assigned to the DBGM-1 and DBGM-2 levels. The no runaway safety function has 
the following performance goals during and after a seismic event: 
• The SSC shall stop the transport train (the trailer/car containing a waste form) after 
a seismic event (however, a tipover is not precluded). 
• The SSC shall not allow the speed of the transport train to exceed its maximum 
allowable limits. 
• The coupler shall remain connected between the locomotive and transport train. 
B.1.14 Safety Function: No Discharge 
The “no discharge” safety function is assigned to SSCs such as vent ducts, as well as HEPA 
filters and filter housings, which can contain a significant particulate dose and are assigned to 
either a DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. 
For filters, the no discharge safety function has the following performance goals during and after 
a seismic event: 
• No significant release or dispersement of radionuclides (particulates) to the 
immediate environment (to the structure interior or exterior) due to shaking of the 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 B-6 March 2005 
filter and/or deformation of the filter (housing) system occurs. A significant release 
is defined as a release that results in less than a small fraction of the applicable dose 
limit over a period of 24 hours. 
• No significant release or dispersement of radionuclides (particulates) back into the 
interior ventilation system (i.e., no back flow); this shall be precluded by 
valves/dampers or other appropriate devices. 
• External components of the system (e.g., housings and fans) shall be rigidly 
anchored to major building elements (walls, floors, partitions). 
• The system shall maintain its structural integrity, and distortion/damage of the 
housing and hangers (if applicable) will be limited. 
For vent ducts, the no discharge safety function has the following performance goals during and 
after a seismic event: 
• No significant release or dispersement of radionuclides (particulates) to the 
immediate environment. A significant release is defined as a release that results in 
less than a small fraction of the applicable dose limit over a period of 24 hours, and 
analyses shall consider potential accumulations within the duct re-entering the air 
stream. 
• The duct shall maintain effective confinement of internal airflow with minimal 
outflow through joints. 
• The duct shall maintain its structural integrity, and distortion/damage of the duct 
and hangers will be limited. 
B.1.15 Safety Function: No Derailment 
The “no derailment” safety function is assigned to trolley rails and rail tracks, which are assigned 
to either a DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. 
The no derailment safety function has the following performance goals during and after a seismic 
event: 
• No significant structural deformation of the rail occurs (i.e., the rails will not shear, 
heave, or warp) that is serious enough to cause a derailment or tipover of any waste 
transporter on the rail (e.g., WP trolley). 
• No significant failure of the rail occurs (e.g., shearing, separation) that could induce 
a derailment if a transporter would pass over the damaged section. 
• Distortion of the rail will be limited and not expected to be immediately apparent to 
the naked eye. 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 B-7 March 2005 
• The rail will remain, for the most part, anchored and functional (or easily 
repairable). 
• The rail system shall not impede the braking of any waste transporter on the rail. 
B.1.16 Safety Function: No Fall Down 
The “no fall down” safety function is assigned to large equipment (spent fuel handling machines, 
welders) that could impact SSCs if the specific equipment loses its anchorage and falls due to a 
seismic event. These SSCs can be assigned to either a DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level. 
The no fall down safety function has the following performance goals during and after a seismic 
event: 
• The equipment, as a system, shall not collapse or fall down. The equipment shall 
remain on its track/guide system (if present). 
• Anchorage for the equipment shall maintain the equipment in-place. 
B.1.17 Safety Function: No Loss of Confinement 
The “no loss of confinement” safety function is assigned to facilities and structures assigned to 
either a DBGM-1 or DBGM-2 level where structural integrity and confinement after the seismic 
event must be credited for compliance or added for defense-in-depth. For seismic margin 
calculations, the function corresponds to the state of limited permanent distortion of a structure 
or facility, termed Limit State C. 
In the present dose consequence analysis, no credit is taken for confinement for limiting offsite 
dose to the public and, thereby, this safety function is not used. This definition was added for 
completeness. 
The no loss of confinement safety function has the following performance goals during and after 
a seismic event: 
• No structural collapse occurs (i.e., column and support members remain upright, 
beams remain functional, and walls remain standing), and failure of contents is not 
serious enough to cause severe injury or death, prevent evacuation, or induce a 
breach of a waste container. 
• Confinement of internal airflow is required and will be maintained. Concrete walls 
will remain standing, but may be cracked. This cracking however, is small enough 
to maintain the pressure differential with normal HVAC. The largest cracks are 
expected to be no greater than approximately one-eighth in. 
• Distortion of the structure will be very limited and not expected to be immediately 
apparent to the naked eye. 
• Components will remain anchored and functional or easily repairable. 

000-30R-MGR0-00400-000-001 B-8 March 2005 
An additional requirement of this safety function is that the failure of adjacent structures and 
other SSCs (whether safety-related or not) shall be considered in seismic analyses as appropriate 
and shall not induce collapse of the designated structure.
