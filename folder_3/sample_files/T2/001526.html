<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – Small businesses and their representatives have eagerly 
responded to the Office of Advocacy’s call for nominations of federal rules in 
need of review and reform. Nominations have been received from across the 
country since the announcement of the Regulatory Review and Reform (r3) 
initiative.</p>
<p>“We are excited about the initial response to our r3 initiative,” said Thomas 
M. Sullivan, Chief Counsel for Advocacy. “Clearly, small business owners are 
concerned about the burden placed on them by regulations that may be outdate or 
unwieldy. More importantly, they are doing more than complaining; the small 
business community is making constructive suggestions for how to improve current 
rules.”</p>
<p>Advocacy research shows that complying with all federal regulations now costs 
our economy $1.1 trillion per year - more per household than the cost of 
healthcare. The smallest of businesses bear the brunt of the business 
regulations. They annually pay 45 percent more per employee to comply with 
federal regulations than big businesses do.</p>
<p>The Office of Advocacy of the U.S. Small Business Administration is still 
seeking nominations of federal rules in need of review and reform. The “Top 10” 
rules nominated by small business owners, trade associations, and others will be 
transmitted to appropriate federal agencies for review and reform.</p>
<p>Nominate regulations needing review and reform by visiting the Office of 
Advocacy r3 website at </font><a href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/r3">
<font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff"><u><i>www.sba.gov/advo/r3</i></u></font></a><font FACE="Times New Roman">, 
by sending an email to </font><a href="mailto:advocacy@sba.gov">
<font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff"><u><i>advocacy@sba.gov</i></u></font></a><font FACE="Times New Roman">, 
or by calling Keith Holman at (202) 205-6936. Nominations are due by December 
31, 2007.</p>
<p>The r3 initiative addresses many of the issues raised in a recent GAO report,
<i>Reexamining Regulations: Opportunities Exist to Improve Effectiveness and 
Transparency of Retrospective Reviews</i>. The report spotlighted implementation 
of section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which mandates that agencies 
periodically examine their existing regulations to measure changing impacts on 
small business.</p>
<p>The Office of Advocacy, the “small business watchdog” of the federal 
government, examines the role and status of small business in the economy and 
independently represents the views of small business to federal agencies, 
Congress, and the President. It is the source for small business statistics 
presented in user-friendly formats, and it funds research into small business 
issues.</p>
