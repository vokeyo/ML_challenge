 I.  INTRODUCTION 
 1.  In  this  Order,  we  amend  the  Commission’s  rules  on  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  as  required  by  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  of  2005  (the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act).  1  Specifically,  we  (1) 


 codify  an  established  business  relationship  (EBR)  exemption  to  the  prohibition  on  sending  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements;  (2)  provide  a  definition  of  an  EBR  to  be  used  in  the  context  of  unsolicited 
 facsimile  advertisements;  (3)  require  the  sender  of  a  facsimile  advertisement  to  provide  specified  notice  and  contact  information  on  the  facsimile  that  allows  recipients  to  “opt-  out”  of  any  future  facsimile 
 transmissions  from  the  sender;  and  (4)  specify  the  circumstances  under  which  a  request  to  “opt-  out”  complies  with  the  Act.  We  believe  these  rules  balance  the  interests  of  entities  that  send  facsimile 
 advertisements  with  those  of  persons  that  wish  to  avoid  such  messages.  In  addition,  we  take  this  opportunity  to  address  certain  issues  raised  in  petitions  for  reconsideration  of  the  2003  Report  and  Order  2 
 concerning  the  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act’s  (TCPA)  3  facsimile  advertising  rules. 
 II.  BACKGROUND 
 A.  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991 
 2.  On  December  20,  1991,  Congress  enacted  the  TCPA  to  address  a  growing  number  of  telephone  marketing  calls  and  certain  telemarketing  practices  thought  to  be  an  invasion  of  consumer 


 privacy.  4  In  relevant  part,  the  TCPA  prohibits  the  use  of  any  telephone  facsimile  machine,  computer,  or  other  device  to  send  an  “unsolicited  advertisement”  to  a  telephone  facsimile  machine.  5  An  unsolicited 
 advertisement  is  defined  as  “any  material  advertising  the  commercial  availability  or  quality  of  any 
 1  See  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  of  2005,  Pub.  L.  No.  109-  21,  119  Stat.  359  (2005)  (Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act). 
 Section  2(  h)  of  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  the  Commission  to  issue  regulations  to  implement  these  amendments  no  later  than  April  5,  2006. 


 2  See  Rules  and  Regulations  Implementing  the  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991,  CG  Docket  No.  02- 
 278,  Report  and  Order,  18  FCC  Rcd  14014  (2003)  (2003  TCPA  Order). 
 3  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991,  Pub.  L.  No.  102-  243,  105  Stat.  2394  (1991),  codified  at  47  U.  S.  C. 
 §  227. 
 4  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991,  Pub.  L.  No.  102-  243,  105  Stat.  2394  (1991),  codified  at  47  U.  S.  C. 
 §  227.

 property,  goods,  or  services  which  is  transmitted  to  any  person  without  that  person’s  prior  express  invitation  or  permission.”  6  The  TCPA  also  requires  those  sending  any  messages  via  telephone  facsimile 
 machines  to  identify  themselves  to  message  recipients.  7  The  TCPA  did  not  expressly  exempt  persons  with  whom  the  sender  has  an  EBR  or  tax  exempt  nonprofit  organizations  from  the  prohibition  on  sending 
 unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements,  although  it  did  create  such  exemptions  from  the  definition  of  “telephone  solicitation.”  8 


 B.  TCPA  Orders 
 3.  In  1992,  the  Commission  adopted  rules  implementing  the  TCPA,  including  restrictions  on  the  transmission  of  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  by  facsimile  machines.  9  The  Commission’s 


 rules  on  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  incorporated  the  language  of  the  statute  virtually  verbatim.  10  The  Commission  stated  that  “the  TCPA  leaves  the  Commission  without  discretion  to  create  exemptions 
 from  or  limit  the  effects  of  the  prohibition”  on  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements.  11  The  Commission  concluded,  however,  that  facsimile  transmissions  from  persons  or  entities  that  have  an  EBR  with  the 
 recipient  can  evidence  the  necessary  invitation  or  permission  of  the  recipient  to  receive  the  facsimile  advertisement.  12  The  Commission  defined  the  term  “established  business  relationship”  to  mean: 


 a  prior  or  existing  relationship  formed  by  a  voluntary  two-  way  communication  between  a  person  or  entity  and  a  residential  subscriber  with  or  without  an  exchange  of 
 consideration,  on  the  basis  of  an  inquiry,  application,  purchase  or  transaction  by  the  residential  subscriber  regarding  products  or  services  offered  by  such  person  or  entity, 
 which  relationship  has  not  been  previously  terminated  by  either  party.  13 
 4.  On  July  3,  2003,  the  Commission  revised  many  of  its  telemarketing  and  facsimile  advertising  rules  under  the  TCPA.  14  The  Commission  reversed  its  prior  conclusion  that  an  EBR  provides 


 6  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  a)(  4). 
 7  Specifically,  the  TCPA  provides  that  the  facsimile  include  “in  a  margin  at  the  top  or  bottom  of  each  transmitted 
 page  of  the  message  or  on  the  first  page  of  the  transmission,  the  date  and  time  it  is  sent  and  an  identification  of  the  business,  other  entity,  or  individual  sending  the  message  and  the  telephone  number  of  the  sending  machine  or  of 


 such  business,  other  entity,  or  individual.”  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  d)(  1)(  B).  8 
 See  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  a)(  3). 
 9  See  Rules  and  Regulations  Implementing  the  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991,  CC  Docket  No.  92- 
 90,  Report  and  Order,  7  FCC  Rcd  8752  (1992)  (1992  TCPA  Order);  see  also  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.1200.  10 
 See,  e.  g.,  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.1200(  a)(  3)  (no  person  or  entity  may  “[  u]  se  a  telephone  facsimile  machine,  computer,  or  other  device  to  send  an  unsolicited  advertisement  to  a  telephone  facsimile  machine.”);  47  C.  F.  R.  § 


 64.1200(  f)(  10)  (the  term  “unsolicited  advertisement  means  any  material  advertising  the  commercial  availability  or  quality  of  any  property,  goods,  or  services  which  is  transmitted  to  any  person  without  that  person’s  prior  express 
 invitation  or  permission”).  11

 companies  with  the  necessary  express  permission  to  send  facsimile  advertisements  to  their  customers.  15  Instead,  the  Commission  concluded  that  the  recipient’s  express  permission  must  be  in  writing  and  include 
 the  recipient’s  signature.  16  The  Commission  also  revised  the  definition  of  an  EBR,  in  the  context  of  telephone  solicitations,  to  limit  the  duration  of  that  exception  to  18  months  after  the  recipient’s  last 
 purchase  or  transaction,  or  three  months  after  the  recipient’s  last  application  or  inquiry.  17  Following  the  release  of  the  2003  TCPA  Order,  several  entities  filed  petitions  for  reconsideration,  most  of  which  were 
 related  to  the  Commission’s  facsimile  advertising  rules.  18 
 5.  On  August  18,  2003,  the  Commission  issued  an  Order  on  Reconsideration  that  delayed,  until  January  1,  2005,  the  effective  date  of  the  requirement  that  the  sender  of  a  facsimile  advertisement 


 first  obtain  the  recipient’s  prior  express  permission  in  writing.  19  Comments  filed  after  the  release  of  the  2003  TCPA  Order  indicated  that  many  organizations  needed  additional  time  to  secure  this  prior  written 
 permission.  20  On  October  3,  2003,  the  Commission  released  an  order  staying  the  18-  month  and  three-month  time  limitations  imposed  on  the  duration  of  the  EBR  as  applied  to  the  sending  of  unsolicited 
 facsimile  advertisements  pending  either  a  decision  on  this  issue  on  reconsideration  or  January  1,  2005.  21  On  October  1,  2004  and  June  27,  2005,  the  Commission  further  delayed  the  effective  date  of  these 
 requirements.  22 
 C.  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  of  2005 
 6.  On  July  9,  2005,  Congress  enacted  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  of  2005  which  amends  the  facsimile  advertising  provisions  of  the  TCPA.  23  In  general,  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act:  (1)  codifies

 16  Id.  at  14128-  29,  para.  191.  See  also  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.1200(  a)(  3)(  i). 
 17  Id.  at  14079,  para.  113.  See  also  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.1200(  f)(  3).  Prior  to  the  2003  TCPA  Order,  the  EBR  definition 
 applied  to  both  telephone  solicitations  and  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisement  transmissions  and  contained  no  expiration  date. 


 18  Petitioners  described  a  variety  of  specific  types  of  communications  and  asked  whether  they  are  covered  by  the 
 TCPA’s  facsimile  advertising  prohibition.  See  Appendix  C  for  a  list  of  petitions  filed.

 an  EBR  exemption  to  the  prohibition  on  sending  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements;  24  (2)  provides  a  definition  of  an  EBR  to  be  used  in  the  context  of  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements;  25  (3)  requires  the 
 sender  of  a  facsimile  advertisement  to  provide  specified  notice  and  contact  information  on  the  facsimile  that  allows  recipients  to  “opt-  out”  of  any  future  facsimile  transmissions  from  the  sender;  26  and  (4) 
 specifies  the  circumstances  under  which  a  request  to  “opt-  out”  complies  with  the  Act.  27  In  addition,  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  authorizes  the  Commission  to:  (1)  determine  the  “shortest  reasonable  time”  that 
 a  sender  must  comply  with  a  request  not  to  receive  future  facsimile  advertisements;  28  (2)  consider  exempting  certain  classes  of  small  business  senders  from  the  requirement  to  provide  a  “cost-  free” 
 mechanism  for  a  recipient  to  transmit  an  opt-  out  request;  29  and  (3)  consider  whether  to  allow  professional  or  trade  associations  that  are  tax-  exempt  nonprofit  organizations  to  send  unsolicited  advertisements  to 
 their  members  in  furtherance  of  the  association’s  tax-  exempt  purpose  that  do  not  contain  the  “opt-  out”  notice  otherwise  required  by  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act.  30 


 7.  On  December  9,  2005,  the  Commission  released  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  proposing  modifications  to  the  Commission’s  rules  on  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  to  implement 
 the  amendments  required  by  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act.  31 
 III.  DISCUSSION 
 A.  Established  Business  Relationship  Exemption 
 8.  Section  2(  a)  of  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  amends  section  227(  b)(  1)(  C)  of  the  Act  by  adding  an  EBR  exemption  to  the  prohibition  on  sending  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements. 


 Specifically,  section  2(  a)  provides  that  it  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person  within  the  United  States  or  any  person  outside  the  United  States  if  the  recipient  is  within  the  United  States: 


 (C)  to  use  any  telephone  facsimile  machine,  computer,  or  other  device  to  send,  to

 26  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  c). 
 27  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  d).  In  addition,  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  the  Commission  to 
 submit  an  annual  report  to  Congress  regarding  enforcement  of  the  rules  relating  to  the  sending  of  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements.  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  3.  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  also  requires  the 


 Comptroller  General  of  the  United  States  to  conduct  a  study  regarding  complaints  received  by  the  Commission  concerning  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements.  See  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  4.

 a  telephone  facsimile  machine,  an  unsolicited  advertisement,  unless  – 
 (i)  the  unsolicited  advertisement  is  from  a  sender  with  an  established  business  relationship  with  the  recipient; 


 (ii)  the  sender  obtained  the  number  of  the  telephone  facsimile  machine  through  – 
 (I)  the  voluntary  communication  of  such  number,  within  the  context  of  such  established  business  relationship,  from  the  recipient  of 


 the  unsolicited  advertisement,  or 
 (II)  a  directory,  advertisement,  or  site  on  the  Internet  to  which  the  recipient  voluntarily  agreed  to  make  available  its  facsimile 


 number  for  public  distribution,  except  that  this  clause  shall  not  apply  in  the  case  of  an  unsolicited  advertisement  that  is  sent 
 based  on  an  established  business  relationship  with  the  recipient  that  was  in  existence  before  the  date  of  enactment  of  the  Junk 
 Fax  Prevention  Act  of  2005  if  the  sender  possessed  the  facsimile  machine  number  of  the  recipient  before  such  date  of  enactment; 
 and 
 (iii)  the  unsolicited  advertisement  contains  a  notice  meeting  the  requirements  under  paragraph  (2)(  D),  except  that  the  exception  under  clauses  (i)  and  (ii)  shall 


 not  apply  with  respect  to  an  unsolicited  advertisement  sent  to  a  telephone  facsimile  machine  by  a  sender  to  whom  a  request  has  been  made  not  to  send 
 future  unsolicited  advertisements  to  such  telephone  facsimile  machine  that  complies  with  the  requirements  under  paragraph  (2)(  E).  32 


 1.  Established  Business  Relationship  with  Recipient 
 9.  In  the  JFPA  NPRM,  the  Commission  proposed  amending  its  rules  in  accordance  with  the  specific  requirements  in  section  2(  a)  of  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  regarding  the  express  recognition  of 


 an  EBR  exemption.  33  The  Commission  also  sought  specific  comment  on  whether  to  establish  parameters  defining  what  it  means  for  a  person  to  provide  a  facsimile  number  “within  the  context  of  [an]  established 
 business  relationship”  and  what  it  means  for  a  person  to  voluntarily  agree  to  make  a  number  available  for  public  distribution.  34  In  addition,  the  Commission  proposed  removing  section  64.1200(  a)(  3)(  i)  of  the 
 Commission’s  rules,  which  requires  the  recipient  to  obtain  a  signed,  written  statement  indicating  the  recipient’s  consent  to  receive  facsimile  advertisements  from  the  sender.  35 


 10.  As  noted  in  the  JFPA  NPRM,  Congress  concluded  that  an  unsolicited  advertisement  from  a  sender  with  an  EBR  to  the  recipient  will  not  be  governed  by  the  general  prohibition  found  in  section 


 32  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  a).

 227(  b)(  1)(  C)  of  the  TCPA.  36  Instead,  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  permits  the  sending  of  fax  advertisements  if  there  exists  an  EBR  between  the  sender  and  recipient  and  certain  other  conditions  are 
 met  regarding  how  the  facsimile  number  was  obtained.  37 
 11.  In  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  we  now  amend  section  64.1200(  a)(  3)  of  the  Commission’s  rules  to  expressly  recognize  an  EBR  exemption  from  the 


 prohibition  on  sending  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements.  38  The  majority  of  commenters  agree  that  incorporating  such  an  exemption  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  Commission’s  rules  are  consistent  with 
 the  amended  federal  statute.  39  Industry  commenters  contend  that  faxing  continues  to  be  a  preferred  method  of  communication  by  many  businesses  and  that  an  EBR  exemption  will  allow  companies  to 
 communicate  effectively  with  their  customers.  40  For  example,  commenters  note  that  fax  advertisements  are  routinely  sent  from  real  estate  professionals  to  home  buyers,  from  telephone  directory  publishers  to 
 advertisers,  and  from  food  service  distributors  to  restaurants.  41  According  to  these  commenters,  such  advertisements  are  sent  based  on  legitimate  EBRs  between  the  senders  and  recipients.  42  Although  some 
 oppose  an  EBR  exemption  for  fax  advertising,  43  the  Commission’s  mandate  is  to  implement  the  statute  as  enacted  by  Congress.  Moreover,  the  opt-  out  requirements  in  the  statute  will  permit  consumers  to  prevent 
 future  unwanted  faxes—  even  those  from  companies  with  which  they  conduct  business. 
 12.  To  ensure  that  the  EBR  exemption  is  not  exploited,  we  conclude  that  an  entity  that  sends  a  facsimile  advertisement  on  the  basis  of  an  EBR  should  be  responsible  for  demonstrating  the  existence  of 


 the  EBR.  44  The  entity  sending  the  fax  is  in  the  best  position  to  have  records  kept  in  the  usual  course  of

 38  We  correspondingly  remove  section  64.1200(  a)(  3)(  i)  from  the  Commission’s  existing  rules,  as  facsimile  senders 
 will  now  be  permitted  to  send  facsimile  advertisements  to  recipients  with  which  they  have  an  EBR  without  first  securing  the  recipient’s  written  permission.  See  S.  REP.  NO.  109-  76  at  8  (“  This  legislation  is  designed  to  permit 


 legitimate  businesses  to  do  business  with  their  established  customers  and  other  persons  with  whom  they  have  an  established  business  relationship  without  the  burden  of  collecting  prior  written  permission  to  send  these  recipients 
 commercial  faxes”).

 business  showing  an  EBR,  such  as  purchase  agreements,  sales  slips,  applications  and  inquiry  records.  45  We  emphasize  that  we  are  not  requiring  any  specific  records  be  kept  by  facsimile  senders.  46  Should  a 
 question  arise,  however,  as  to  the  validity  of  an  EBR,  the  burden  will  be  on  the  sender  to  show  that  it  has  a  valid  EBR  with  the  recipient. 


 2.  Recipient’s  Facsimile  Number 
 13.  As  set  forth  in  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  an  EBR  alone  does  not  entitle  a  sender  to  fax  an  advertisement  to  an  individual  consumer  or  business.  The  telephone  facsimile  number  must  also  be 


 provided  voluntarily  by  the  recipient.  47  Specifically,  under  the  new  rules,  any  person  sending  a  fax  advertisement  under  the  EBR  exemption  must  have  obtained  the  facsimile  number  directly  from  the 
 recipient  within  the  context  of  the  EBR,  or  ensure  that  the  recipient  voluntarily  agreed  to  make  the  number  available  in  a  directory,  advertisement,  or  site  on  the  Internet  which  is  accessible  to  the  public.  In 
 accordance  with  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  an  exception  to  this  requirement  will  apply  if  the  EBR  was  formed  prior  to  July  9,  2005.  48 


 a.  Facsimile  Number  Obtained  Directly  From  Recipient 
 14.  The  provision  of  a  telephone  facsimile  number  to  a  business  or  other  entity  reflects  a  willingness  to  receive  faxes  from  that  entity.  Accordingly,  it  would  be  permissible  for  the  sender  to  fax 


 an  advertisement  to  a  recipient  that  had  provided  a  facsimile  number  to  the  sender,  for  example,  on  an  application,  information  request,  contact  information  form,  or  membership  renewal  form.  49  It  also  would 
 be  permissible  for  the  recipient  to  provide  to  the  sender  its  facsimile  number  orally  over  the  telephone  or  through  a  website  maintained  by  the  fax  sender.  In  circumstances  such  as  these,  we  conclude  that  the 
 consumer  has  provided  the  facsimile  number  in  the  context  of  an  established  business  relationship  with  the  fax  sender.  50  In  the  event  a  recipient  complains  that  its  facsimile  number  was  not  provided  to  the 
 sender,  the  burden  rests  with  the  sender  to  demonstrate  that  the  number  was  communicated  in  the  context 
 45  See  AGs  Comments  at  9;  Lorman  Ed  Services  Comments  at  17  (normal  business  records  should  suffice);  AFSA 
 Comments  at  4  (as  result  of  an  EBR,  there  may  be  any  number  of  documents,  applications,  agreements,  and  other  communications  exchanged  between  the  parties).  But  see  American  Bankers  Assoc  Comments  at  4  (the  costs  of 


 maintaining  evidence  of  an  EBR  could  be  enormous).  We  agree  with  ABA  that  digitized  documents  would  be  acceptable  if  they  established  the  existence  of  the  EBR. 


 46  See  CBS  Reply  Comments  at  4  (the  sender  should  have  the  flexibility  to  demonstrate  the  existence  of  an  EBR 
 through  the  presentation  of  records  that  it  chooses  to  retain  rather  than  be  subject  to  extensive  recordkeeping  requirements). 


 47  See  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  a);  see  also  supra,  para.  8.  See  EPIC  Comments  at  1  (Commission  should 
 recognize  that  a  person  has  voluntarily  agreed  to  make  a  number  available  for  public  distribution  only  where  that  person  has  explicitly  stated  that  they  wish  to  receive  unsolicited  commercial  messages). 


 48  See  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  a). 
 49  See  Lorman  Ed  Services  Comments  at  16  (suggesting  a  recipient’s  seminar  registration  form,  product  order 
 form  or  warranty  card  should  all  count  as  voluntarily  providing  the  number  in  the  course  of  an  EBR).  Similarly,  a  business  card  containing  a  fax  number  that  is  provided  by  the  recipient  to  the  sender  would  permit  the  sending  of  a 


 facsimile  advertisement.

 of  the  EBR. 
 b.  Facsimile  Number  Obtained  from  Directory,  Advertisement  or  Internet  Site 
 15.  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  that,  if  the  sender  relies  on  an  EBR  and  obtains  the  facsimile  number  from  a  directory,  advertisement  or  site  on  the  Internet,  the  sender  must  ensure  that  the 


 recipient  voluntarily  agreed  to  make  the  number  available  for  public  distribution.  51  Commenters  contend  that  it  would  be  unduly  burdensome  for  senders  of  facsimile  advertisements  to  verify  that  a  consumer 
 voluntarily  agreed  to  make  the  facsimile  number  public  in  every  instance.  52  We  agree.  Therefore,  we  determine  that  a  facsimile  number  obtained  from  the  recipient’s  own  directory,  advertisement,  or  internet 
 site  was  voluntarily  made  available  for  public  distribution,  unless  the  recipient  has  noted  on  such  materials  that  it  does  not  accept  unsolicited  advertisements  at  the  facsimile  number  in  question.  53  For 
 instance,  if  the  sender  obtains  the  number  from  the  recipient’s  own  advertisement,  that  advertisement  would  serve  as  evidence  of  the  recipient’s  agreement  to  make  the  number  available  for  public 
 distribution.  54  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  sender  obtains  the  number  from  sources  of  information  compiled  by  third  parties—  e.  g.,  membership  directories,  commercial  databases,  or  internet  listings—  the  sender 
 must  take  reasonable  steps  to  verify  that  the  recipient  consented  to  have  the  number  listed,  such  as  calling  or  emailing  the  recipient.  55  We  agree  that  membership  directories  requiring  a  fee  to  use  are  limited  in 
 distribution  and,  as  such,  the  information  included  within  the  directory  is  made  available  to  subscribers 


 51  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  a).  See  also  EPIC  Comments  at  1  (the  mere  presence  of  a  fax  number  in  a 
 directory  should  not  constitute  the  voluntary  agreement  for  dissemination  to  senders). 
 52  See,  e.  g.,  NNA  Comments  at  8;  NAR  Comments  at  3-  4  (asserting  that  any  rules  must  allow  senders  to  obtain 
 facsimile  numbers  from  public  sources  to  whom  persons  have  made  their  fax  numbers  publicly  available);  Everett  Labs  Comments  at  5-  6. 


 53  See  AHLA  Comments  at  3;  NIADA  Comments  at  2;  Reed  Elsevier  Comments  at  8.  But  see  EPIC  Comments  at 
 1  (the  Commission  should  recognize  that  a  person  has  voluntarily  agreed  to  make  a  number  available  for  public  distribution  only  where  that  person  has  explicitly  stated  that  they  wish  to  receive  unsolicited  commercial 


 messages);  Texas  OPC  Comments  at  4  (voluntary  agreement  to  receive  fax  advertisements  should  not  be  found  unless  the  website  also  contains  a  statement  expressly  indicating  this). 


 54  Another  example  might  be  a  number  obtained  from  the  recipient’s  own  letterhead  or  fax  cover  sheet.  See  NFIB 
 Comments  at  4;  Lorman  Ed  Services  Comments  at  17;  Reed  Elsevier  Comments  at  8  (for  a  fax  number  listed  in  a  directory,  which  an  individual  reasonably  can  assume  is  public,  senders  can  assume  that  such  number  has 


 voluntarily  been  provided  for  public  distribution).  But  see  Texas  OPC  Reply  Comments  at  4  (no  consent  can  be  inferred  from  the  mere  fact  that  the  recipient’s  fax  number  appears  on  a  website). 


 55  See  AGs  Comments  at  10  (a  doctor  who  publishes  her  fax  number  in  a  medical  society  directory  should  not  be 
 deemed  to  have  made  the  number  publicly  available  if  there  is  no  reasonable  expectation  that  the  directory  is  intended  for  use  by  third  parties  for  marketing  purposes);  Lorman  Ed  Services  Comments  at  17-  18;  Biggerstaff 


 Comments  at  15  (explaining  that  list  brokers  mine  for  numbers,  combining  lists  of  numbers  from  multiple  sources  and  then  reselling  those  lists  in  directories);  EPIC  Comments  at  2;  NAW  Comments  at  4-  5  (noting  that  some 
 Senators  and  their  staff  raised  concerns  during  the  JFPA  legislative  process  that  a  mass  retailer  would  be  permitted  to  purchase  a  bulk  fax  list  and  fax  advertisements  to  every  number  on  it  under  the  EBR  exemption  because 
 everyone  has  purchased  something  at  a  Wal-  Mart,  but  opposing  a  requirement  that  businesses  verify  fax  numbers  from  a  legitimate  public  source).  But  see  American  Bankers  Assoc  Comments  at  3  (opposing  a  requirement  that 
 senders  verify  a  list  of  compiler’s  data  as  voluntary);  ASTA  Comments  at  6  (there  are  no  apparent  practical  steps  that  can  be  expected  beyond  a  simple  inquiry  of  the  directory  vendor).

 and  purchasers,  not  to  the  general  public.  56  We  also  reiterate  that  senders  of  facsimile  advertisements  must  have  an  EBR  with  the  recipient  in  order  to  send  the  advertisement  to  the  recipient’s  facsimile 
 number.  The  fact  that  the  facsimile  number  was  made  available  in  a  directory,  advertisement  or  website  does  not  alone  entitle  a  person  to  send  a  facsimile  advertisement  to  that  number. 


 c.  Established  Business  Relationship  Formed  Prior  to  July  9,  2005 
 16.  Finally,  as  the  Commission  noted  in  the  JPFA  NPRM,  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  provides  a  third  avenue  for  the  sender  to  obtain  the  facsimile  number.  57  Pursuant  to  the  statute,  the 


 amended  rules  shall  provide  that  if  the  EBR  was  in  existence  prior  to  July  9,  2005,  and  the  sender  also  possessed  the  facsimile  number  before  July  9,  2005,  the  sender  may  send  facsimile  advertisements  to  that 
 recipient  without  demonstrating  how  the  number  was  obtained  or  verifying  it  was  provided  voluntarily  by  the  recipient.  58  We  emphasize  that,  to  fall  within  this  exception,  a  valid  EBR  must  have  been  formed 
 between  the  sender  and  recipient  before  July  9,  2005.  For  example,  a  business  that  sold  a  product  to  a  consumer  in  2004  and  secured  that  consumer’s  facsimile  number  in  2004,  would  be  permitted  to  fax  an 
 advertisement  to  the  consumer  regardless  of  how  the  facsimile  number  was  obtained.  We  agree  with  those  commenters  that  contend  it  would  be  burdensome  for  senders  to  prove  a  facsimile  number  was  in 
 their  possession  prior  to  July  9,  2005.  59  Therefore,  we  adopt  a  presumption  that  if  a  valid  EBR  existed  prior  to  July  9,  2005,  the  sender  had  the  facsimile  number  prior  to  that  date  as  well.  60  In  the  event  the 
 recipient  alleges  a  violation  of  these  provisions,  the  sender  will  need  to  provide  proof  that  the  EBR  existed  prior  to  July  9,  2005.  61 


 B.  Definition  of  Established  Business  Relationship 
 17.  As  noted  in  the  JFPA  NPRM,  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  includes  a  definition  of  an 


 56  See  Biggerstaff  Comments  at  16;  see  also  ABM  Comments  at  6  (fax  number  in  association  directories  that  are 
 for  use  only  by  members  ought  not  be  considered  to  have  been  provided  by  the  facsimile  machine  owners  for  the  purpose  of  making  them  publicly  available.  A  sender  should  be  required  to  ascertain  whether  or  not  the  fax 


 number  was  intended  by  the  owner  to  be  made  public). 
 57  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  a)  (“.  .  .  except  that  this  clause  shall  not  apply  in  the  case  of  an  unsolicited 
 advertisement  that  is  sent  based  on  an  established  business  relationship  with  the  recipient  that  was  in  existence  before  the  date  of  enactment  of  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  of  2005  if  the  sender  possessed  the  facsimile  machine 


 number  of  the  recipient  before  such  date  of  enactment  .  .  .”).  58 
 Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  a).  See  also  Commission’s  amended  rule  at  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.1200(  a)(  3)(  ii)(  C). 
 59  See  ABA  Comments  at  3;  NNA  Comments  at  9;  YPA  Comments  at  3;  Staples  Comments  at  3  (it  is  unlikely  that 
 either  a  sender  or  recipient  will  be  able  to  produce  paper  records,  documenting  the  date  on  which  a  fax  number  was  obtained  or  provided). 


 60  This  presumption  could  be  rebutted,  for  example,  with  evidence  that  the  recipient  did  not  use  the  facsimile 
 number  before  July  9,  2005.  See  AFSA  Comments  at  3;  YPA  Comments  at  3;  NNA  Comments  at  3;  Staples  Comments  at  1  (Commission  should  establish  a  rebuttable  presumption  that  a  sender  acquired  a  recipient’s  fax 


 number  prior  to  July  9,  2005);  DMA  Comments  at  9  (the  issue  of  what  is  voluntary  will  arise  only  where  there  is  already  an  EBR  between  the  sender  and  recipient).

 EBR  to  be  used  in  the  context  of  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements.  62  The  statute  provides  that  “[  t]  he  term  ‘established  business  relationship,  .  .  .  shall  have  the  meaning  given  the  term  in  section  64.1200  of 
 title  47  .  .  .  as  in  effect  on  January  1,  2003,  except  that  such  term  shall  include  a  relationship  between  a  person  or  entity  and  a  business  subscriber  subject  to  the  same  terms  applicable  under  such  section  to  a 
 relationship  between  a  person  or  entity  and  a  residential  subscriber.  .  ..”  63  The  January  1,  2003  definition  did  not  include  any  time  limitations  on  the  EBR.  64  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  however,  authorizes  the 
 Commission  to  limit  the  duration  of  the  EBR  in  the  context  of  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  after  a  3-  month  period  beginning  from  the  date  of  enactment  of  the  statute.  65  Therefore,  the  Commission  sought 
 comment  in  the  JFPA  NPRM  on  whether  to  limit  the  EBR.  66  We  specifically  sought  comment  on  whether  it  is  appropriate  to  limit  the  EBR  duration  for  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  in  the  same  manner  as 
 telephone  solicitations.  67 
 1.  EBR  Definition 
 18.  Based  on  the  record,  68  and  in  accordance  with  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  we  adopt  as  part  of  the  Commission’s  rules  the  following  definition  of  an  EBR  for  purposes  of  sending  unsolicited 


 facsimile  advertisements: 
 For  purposes  of  paragraph  (a)(  3)  of  this  section,  the  term  established  business  relationship  means  a  prior  or  existing  relationship  formed  by  a  voluntary  two-way 


 communication  between  a  person  or  entity  and  a  business  or  residential

 63  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  b). 
 64  In  2003,  the  Commission  limited  the  duration  of  the  EBR  for  telephone  solicitations  to  18  months  following  a 
 purchase  or  transaction  and  three  months  after  an  application  or  inquiry.  See  2003  TCPA  Order,  18  FCC  Rcd  at  14079,  para.  113. 


 65  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  f).  (“[  The  Commission]  may,  consistent  with  clause  (ii),  limit  the  duration  of 
 the  existence  of  an  established  business  relationship,  however,  before  establishing  any  such  limits,  the  Commission  shall—(  I)  determine  whether  the  existence  of  the  exception  under  paragraph  (1)(  C)  relating  to  an 


 established  business  relationship  has  resulted  in  a  significant  number  of  complaints  to  the  Commission  regarding  the  sending  of  unsolicited  advertisements  to  telephone  facsimile  machines;  (II)  determine  whether  a  significant 
 number  of  any  such  complaints  involve  unsolicited  advertisements  that  were  sent  on  the  basis  of  an  established  business  relationship  that  was  longer  in  duration  than  the  Commission  believes  is  consistent  with  the  reasonable 
 expectations  of  consumers;  (III)  evaluate  the  costs  to  senders  of  demonstrating  the  existence  of  an  established  business  relationship  within  a  specified  period  of  time  and  the  benefits  to  recipients  of  establishing  a  limitation  on 
 such  established  business  relationship;  and  (IV)  determine  whether  with  respect  to  small  businesses,  the  costs  would  not  be  unduly  burdensome;  and  (ii)  may  not  commence  a  proceeding  to  determine  whether  to  limit  the 
 duration  of  the  existence  of  an  established  business  relationship  before  the  expiration  of  the  3-  month  period  that  begins  on  the  date  of  enactment  of  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  of  2005”).

 subscriber  with  or  without  an  exchange  of  consideration,  on  the  basis  of  an  inquiry,  application,  purchase  or  transaction  by  the  business  or  residential 
 subscriber  regarding  products  or  services  offered  by  such  person  or  entity,  which  relationship  has  not  been  previously  terminated  by  either  party.  69 


 19.  This  definition  extends  the  EBR  exemption  to  faxes  sent  to  both  business  and  residential  subscribers.  Once  established,  the  EBR  will  permit  an  entity  to  send  facsimile  advertisements  to  a 
 business  or  residential  subscriber  until  the  subscriber  “terminates”  it  by  making  a  request  not  to  receive  future  faxes.  70  This  definition  also  clearly  contemplates  that  the  EBR  could  be  formed  by  any  of  the 
 following:  an  inquiry,  application,  purchase  or  transaction  by  the  business  or  residential  subscriber.  71  Consistent  with  the  legislative  history  of  the  TCPA,  an  inquiry  by  a  consumer  could  form  the  basis  of  the 
 EBR.  72  However,  the  definition  makes  clear  that  the  inquiry  or  application  must  be  about  products  or  services  offered  by  the  entity.  Thus,  we  conclude  that  an  inquiry  about  store  location  or  the  identity  of 
 the  fax  sender,  for  instance,  would  not  alone  form  an  EBR  for  purposes  of  sending  facsimile  advertisements.  73  Merely  visiting  a  website,  without  taking  additional  steps  to  request  information  or 
 provide  contact  information,  also  does  not  create  an  EBR.  74 
 20.  In  addition,  we  conclude  that  the  EBR  exemption  applies  only  to  the  entity  with  which  the  business  or  residential  subscriber  has  had  a  “voluntary  two-  way  communication.”  It  would  not  extend 


 to  affiliates  of  that  entity,  including  a  fax  broadcaster  which  is  retained  to  send  facsimile  ads  on  behalf  of  that  entity.  75  While  the  fax  broadcaster  may  transmit  an  advertisement  on  behalf  of  an  entity  that  has  an 
 EBR  with  the  recipient,  it  is  not  permitted  to  use  that  same  EBR  to  send  a  fax  advertisement  on  behalf  of  another  client.  76  We  find  that,  unlike  the  national  do-  not-  call  registry,  which  allows  consumers  to  avoid 
 most  unwanted  telemarketing  calls  by  registering  a  telephone  number  once  every  five  years,  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  a  consumer  to  opt-  out  of  unwanted  fax  advertisements  from  each  entity  with 


 69  See  amended  rule  at  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.1200(  f)(  5). 
 70  We  note  that  the  act  of  terminating  the  EBR  exemption  will  only  terminate  the  relationship  for  purposes  of 
 receiving  communications  constituting  “unsolicited  advertisements.”  A  fax  regarding  collection  of  a  debt  that  does  not  contain  an  advertisement  will  not  be  subject  to  the  facsimile  advertising  rules.  See  ACA  Comments  at  9-

 but  remain  on  the  list  for  other  advertisements).

 which  the  consumer  has  an  EBR.  We  believe  that  to  permit  companies  to  transfer  their  EBRs  to  affiliates  would  place  an  enormous  burden  on  consumers  to  prevent  faxes  from  companies  with  which  they  have  no 
 direct  business  relationship. 
 2.  Limits  on  Duration  of  Established  Business  Relationship 
 21.  Industry  commenters  overwhelming  oppose  limiting  the  duration  of  the  EBR.  77  They  argue  that  any  time  limits  on  the  EBR  would  interfere  with  routine  business  transactions,  would  unduly 


 burden  senders,  and  would  not  provide  a  corresponding  benefit  to  recipients,  particularly  in  light  of  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act’s  opt-  out  notice  requirements.  78  Specifically,  these  commenters  maintain  that 
 keeping  records  of  an  EBR  that  is  limited  in  duration  would  involve  significant  costs  to  businesses  that  send  faxes  to  their  customers.  79  In  addition,  many  of  these  commenters  maintain  that  Congress  required 
 the  Commission  to  first  review  complaints  filed  under  the  new  rules  before  taking  action  to  limit  the  duration  of  the  EBR.  80  These  commenters  disagree  as  to  what  limits  might  be  appropriate  should  the 
 Commission  determine  to  limit  the  EBR.  81  They  argue  that  business-  to-  business  relationships  do  not  fall  into  predictable  cycles,  and  that  an  18-  month  limit  might  make  sense  for  one  business,  but  would  be 
 inadequate  for  another.  82 
 22.  Other  commenters  urge  the  Commission  to  limit  the  EBR,  arguing  that  the  shifting  of  costs  to  a  recipient  that  must  deal  with  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  weighs  in  favor  of  imposing 


 limits  on  the  EBR.  83  They  support  varying  time  limits.  84

 23.  As  required  by  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  we  intend  to  closely  monitor  implementation  of  the  new  EBR  exemption  and  opt-  out  policies  adopted  herein.  85  Within  one  year  of  the 
 effective  date  of  this  Order,  the  Commission  will  evaluate  its  complaint  data  to  determine  whether  the  EBR  exception  has  resulted  in  a  significant  number  of  complaints  regarding  facsimile  advertisements,  and 
 whether  such  complaints  involve  facsimile  advertisements  sent  based  on  an  EBR  of  a  duration  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  reasonable  expectations  of  consumers.  86 


 C.  Notice  of  Opt-  Out  Opportunity 
 24.  Section  2(  c)  of  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  adds  language  to  the  TCPA  that  requires  senders  to  include  a  notice  on  the  first  page  of  the  unsolicited  advertisement  that  instructs  the  recipient 


 how  to  request  that  they  not  receive  future  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  from  the  sender.  87  In  accordance  with  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  we  amend  our  rules  to  require  that  all  unsolicited  facsimile 
 advertisements  contain  a  notice  on  the  first  page  of  the  advertisement  stating  that  the  recipient  is  entitled  to  request  that  the  sender  not  send  any  future  unsolicited  advertisements.  88  This  notice  must  include  a 
 domestic  contact  telephone  number  and  a  facsimile  machine  number  for  the  recipient  to  transmit  such  a  request  to  the  sender  and,  as  discussed  below,  at  least  one  cost-  free  mechanism  for  transmitting  an  opt-  out 
 request.  89  We  emphasize  that  including  an  opt-  out  notice  on  a  facsimile  advertisement  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  permit  the  transmission  of  the  fax;  an  EBR  with  the  recipient  must  also  exist.

 inquiries  and  six  months  for  purchases);  PRC  Comments  at  3  (does  not  believe  18/  3-  month  limits  strike  a  good  balance,  as  unwanted  faxes  are  more  intrusive  than  unwanted  telephone  calls  because  faxes  come  all  through  the 
 night);  Worsham  Comments  at  1  (12  months  from  purchase;  one  month  from  inquiry);  SHRM  Comments  at  8  (supports  a  limit  on  the  EBR  of  30  months  for  professional  and  trade  associations);  HPC  Comments  at  3  (18/  3- 
 month  limits  are  appropriate).

 86  See  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  f).  We  note,  however,  that  because  the  Commission’s  facsimile 
 advertising  rules  recognize  an  EBR  exception,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  many  such  recipients  of  facsimile  advertisements  from  senders  with  whom  they  have  an  EBR  would  not  file  complaints  with  the  Commission. 


 87  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  c)  (“[  The  Commission]  shall  provide  that  a  notice  contained  in  an  unsolicited 
 advertisement  complies  with  the  requirements  under  this  subparagraph  only  if—(  i)  the  notice  is  clear  and  conspicuous  and  on  the  first  page  of  the  unsolicited  advertisement;  (ii)  the  notice  states  that  the  recipient  may 


 make  a  request  to  the  sender  of  the  unsolicited  advertisement  not  to  send  any  future  unsolicited  advertisements  to  a  telephone  facsimile  machine  or  machines  and  that  failure  to  comply,  within  the  shortest  reasonable  time,  as 
 determined  by  the  Commission,  with  such  a  request  meeting  the  requirements  under  subparagraph  (E)  is  unlawful[.]”).  See  also  S.  REP.  NO.  109-  76  at  8  (“  The  Committee  .  .  .  added  the  requirement  that  every  unsolicited

 request  at  any  time”).

 1.  Clear  and  Conspicuous 
 25.  In  the  JFPA  NPRM,  we  sought  comment  on  whether  it  was  necessary  to  set  forth  in  our  rules  the  circumstances  under  which  the  opt-  out  notice  will  be  considered  “clear  and  conspicuous.”  90 


 Some  commenters  argue  that  as  long  as  the  notice  is  on  the  first  page  and  is  apparent  to  a  reasonable  consumer,  the  Commission  should  not  further  define  what  will  be  considered  “clear  and  conspicuous.”  91 
 Others  urge  the  Commission  to  provide  specific  guidance  to  ensure  consumers  are  aware  of  their  opt-  out  rights  and  sending  parties  have  standards  by  which  they  can  comply  with  the  law.  92  We  are  persuaded 
 that  rules  specifying  the  font  type,  size  and  wording  of  the  notice  might  interfere  with  fax  senders’  ability  to  design  notices  that  serve  their  customers.  93  However,  we  make  some  additional  determinations  about 
 the  opt-  out  notice  so  that  facsimile  recipients  have  the  information  necessary  to  avoid  future  unwanted  faxes. 


 26.  Consistent  with  the  definition  in  our  truth-  in-  billing  rules,  “clear  and  conspicuous”  for  purposes  of  the  opt-  out  notice  means  a  notice  that  would  be  apparent  to  a  reasonable  consumer.  94  We  also 
 conclude  that  the  notice  must  be  separate  from  the  advertising  copy  or  other  disclosures  and  placed  at  either  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  fax.  95  Many  facsimile  advertisements  today  contain  text  covering  the 
 entire  sheet  of  paper,  making  it  difficult  to  see  an  opt-  out  notice  that  is  placed  amongst  the  advertising  material.  Thus,  the  notice  must  be  distinguishable  from  the  advertising  material  through,  for  example,  use 
 of  bolding,  italics,  different  font,  or  the  like.  We  clarify  that,  in  accordance  with  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  if  there  are  several  pages  to  the  fax,  the  first  page  of  the  advertisement  must  contain  the  opt-  out 
 notice.  96

 2.  Cost-  Free  Opt-  Out  Mechanism 
 27.  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  that  the  notice  identify  “a  cost-  free  mechanism  for  a  recipient  to  transmit  a  request  pursuant  to  such  notice  to  the  sender  of  the  unsolicited  advertisement[.]”  97 


 In  accordance  with  the  statute,  we  amend  the  rules  to  require  senders  to  identify  a  cost-  free  mechanism  in  their  notices.  98  Industry  members  oppose  a  rule  requiring  the  provision  of  a  toll-  free  number,  arguing  that 
 a  toll-  free  number  would  be  costly  and  answering  the  calls  or  setting  up  an  automated  system  to  do  so  would  be  overly  burdensome,  particularly  for  small  businesses.  99  Of  these  commenters,  some  suggest  that 
 senders  be  permitted  to  provide  a  website  address  through  which  consumers  can  opt-  out  of  future  faxes.  100  Some  consumer  advocates  contend  that  senders  should  be  required  to  provide  the  toll-  free  telephone 
 number,  as  many  consumers  do  not  have  access  to  the  Internet.  101 
 28.  In  an  effort  to  balance  the  needs  of  consumers  who  wish  to  opt-  out  of  faxes  with  the  interests  of  business,  we  find  that  a  website  address,  email  address,  toll-  free  telephone  number,  or  toll-  free 


 facsimile  machine  number  will  constitute  “cost-  free  mechanisms”  for  purposes  of  our  rules.  102  We  also  conclude  that  a  local  telephone  number  may  be  considered  a  cost-  free  mechanism  so  long  as  the 
 advertisements  are  sent  to  local  consumers  for  whom  a  call  to  that  number  would  not  result  in  long  distance  or  other  separate  charges.  103  Senders  of  facsimile  advertisements  need  make  available  only  one 
 of  these  mechanisms  to  comply  with  this  requirement.  A  website  or  email  address  will  allow  businesses,  particularly  small  businesses,  to  avoid  excessive  costs  associated  with  maintaining  a  toll-  free  telephone 
 number.  104  If  a  sender  uses  a  website  for  receiving  opt-  out  requests,  it  must  describe  the  opt-  out

 98  See  AGs  Comments  at  20  (to  require  a  recipient  to  incur  charges  simply  to  request  that  no  more  fax  ads  be  sent 
 would  shift  additional  costs  onto  the  shoulders  of  recipients  contrary  to  the  purposes  of  the  JFPA). 
 99  See,  e.  g.,  NNA  Comments  at  4;  NFIB  Comments  at  5. 


 100  See  ASAE  Comments  at  6;  DMA  Comments  at  10;  ABA  Comments  at  2;  ASAE  Comments  at  6. 
 101  AGs  Comments  at  21;  EPIC  Comments  at  6. 
 102  See  Comerica  Comments  at  1.  See  also  Texas  OPC  Reply  Comments  at  10  (recipient  must  pay  for  a  postcard 
 and  postage  or  paper,  envelope  and  postage,  which  is  not  cost-  free). 
 103  NFIB  Comments  at  5.  See  also  S.  REP.  NO.  109-  76  at  10  (noting  that  the  cost-  free  mechanism  might  include 
 either  a  toll-  free  or  a  local  telephone  number). 
 104  Given  that  we  are  not  mandating  that  senders  offer  a  toll-  free  telephone  number  for  consumers  to  make  opt-  out 
 requests,  we  find  no  reason  to  exempt  small  business  from  the  cost-  free  mechanism  requirement.  As  discussed  above,  businesses  can  use  a  website  address  or  email  address  for  receiving  such  requests.  The  record  contains 


 little  empirical  evidence  that  the  costs  associated  with  setting  up  a  website  or  email  address  would  be  unduly  burdensome  to  a  small  business  given  their  revenues.  See  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  Sec.  2(  c)  (“[  The  Commission 
 may…  subject  to  such  conditions  as  the  Commission  may  prescribe,  exempt  certain  classes  of  small  business  senders  [from  the  requirement  to  provide  a  cost-  free  mechanism  for  a  recipient  to  transmit  an  opt-  out  request],  but 
 only  if  the  Commission  determines  that  the  costs  to  such  class  are  unduly  burdensome  given  the  revenues  generated  by  such  small  businesses”).  We  also  note  that  a  third  party  could  be  retained  to  maintain  any  of  these

 mechanism  and  procedures  clearly  and  conspicuously  on  the  first  page  of  the  website. 
 29.  As  noted  above,  apart  from  the  cost-  free  mechanism  required  by  the  statute,  the  opt-  out  notice  must  contain  a  domestic  contact  telephone  number  and  facsimile  machine  number.  105  If  the  cost-free 


 mechanism  offered  by  the  sender  is  either  a  domestic  toll-  free  telephone  number  or  toll-  free  facsimile  machine  number,  the  sender  will  be  in  compliance  with  both  sets  of  requirements.  106  We  agree  with  the 
 Attorneys  General  commenters  that  the  facsimile  number  should  be  a  number  that  is  separate  and  distinct  from  the  telephone  number  to  ensure  consumers  are  less  likely  to  find  a  busy  line  and  can  make  opt-  out 
 requests  without  delay.  107  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  sender  to  ensure  that  the  number(  s)  are  available  to  accept  opt-  out  requests.  In  accordance  with  the  statute,  the  new  rules  will  require  the  sender  to  accept 
 opt-  out  requests  24  hours,  7  days  a  week  at  the  number(  s),  website  or  email  address  identified  in  the  opt-out  notice.  108 


 3.  Timeframe  for  Honoring  Opt-  Out  Requests 
 30.  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  that  the  opt-  out  notice  on  the  facsimile  advertisement  states  that  “failure  to  comply,  within  the  shortest  reasonable  time,  as  determined  by  the 


 Commission,  with  such  a[  n  opt  out]  request  .  .  .  is  unlawful.”  109  In  the  JFPA  NPRM,  we  sought  comment  on  the  “shortest  reasonable  time”  within  which  a  facsimile  sender  should  comply  with  an  opt-  out 
 request.  110  Of  the  comments  filed,  many  were  from  businesses  and  trade  organizations  that  support  a  period  of  30  days  within  which  senders  must  comply  with  opt-  out  requests.  111  Other  commenters  support 
 a  shorter  period  of  time  for  honoring  do-  not-  fax  requests,  such  as  10  or  15  days,  noting  the  costs  associated  with  continuing  to  receive  unwanted  faxes  after  an  opt-  out  request  is  made.  112  CTTC

 maintains  that  legitimate  businesses  that  receive  such  requests  will  honor  them  immediately.  113 
 31.  In  accordance  with  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  we  conclude  that  senders  must  comply  with  an  opt-  out  request  within  the  shortest  reasonable  time  of  such  request.  Taking  into  consideration 


 both  large  databases  of  facsimile  numbers  and  the  limitations  on  certain  small  businesses  to  remove  numbers  for  individuals  that  opt-  out,  we  conclude  that  a  reasonable  time  to  honor  such  requests  must  not 
 exceed  30  days  from  the  date  such  a  request  is  made.  114  The  record  demonstrates  that  30  days  will  provide  a  reasonable  opportunity  for  persons,  including  small  businesses,  to  process  requests  and  remove 
 the  facsimile  numbers  from  their  lists  or  databases.  115  Consistent  with  our  rules  for  company-  specific  do-not-  call  requests,  facsimile  senders  with  the  capability  to  honor  do-  not-  fax  requests  in  less  than  30  days 
 must  do  so.  116  We  believe  that  any  period  greater  than  30  days  will  likely  impose  additional  costs  and  burdens  on  consumers  and  businesses  that  have  taken  steps  to  avoid  facsimile  messages  by  making  opt-out 
 requests.  We  also  conclude  that  the  sender  must  remove  the  facsimile  number  from  its  fax  lists  within  the  30-  day  period,  regardless  of  whether  it  believes  the  number  may  be  used  by  more  than  one 
 individual.  117  We  believe  it  is  reasonable  to  presume  that  persons  making  opt-  out  requests  on  behalf  of  a  business’  facsimile  machine  are  authorized  to  do  so.  Senders  must  honor  such  opt-  out  requests  made  by 
 the  business,  even  if  doing  so  restricts  faxes  sent  to  all  employees  of  that  business.  This  determination  is  consistent  with  our  findings  in  the  do-  not-  call  context  in  which  a  do-  not-  call  request  applies  to  all  persons 
 at  the  residence  associated  with  that  telephone  number.  118 
 32.  We  decline  to  limit  the  time  period  during  which  an  opt-  out  request  remains  in  effect  as  suggested  by  NFIB.  119  We  recognize  that,  like  telephone  numbers,  facsimile  numbers  change  hands  over 


 time.  However,  as  noted  above,  the  national  do-  not-  call  registry  requires  consumers  to  re-  register  just  once  every  five  years  to  avoid  most  telemarketing  calls.  In  the  absence  of  a  similar  do-  not-  fax  list,  a 
 consumer  would  need  to  make  numerous—  perhaps  hundreds—  of  opt-  out  requests  every  five  years  to 
 113  CTTC  Comments  at  2.  According  to  the  Attorneys  General  commenters,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  is 
 taking  steps  to  shorten  from  10  to  3  days  its  timeframe  within  which  senders  of  commercial  email  messages  must  comply  with  opt-  out  requests  from  recipients  under  the  CAN-  SPAM  Act.  See  AGs  Comments  at  16-  17.

 avoid  receiving  unwanted  faxes.  120  Instead,  we  conclude  that  a  consumer  who  wishes  to  receive  faxes  at  a  new  number  or  resume  receiving  faxes  after  previously  opting  out  should  notify  the  sender  of  such 
 changes  by  giving  prior  express  permission  to  the  sender.  121  We  also  encourage  facsimile  senders  to  update  their  facsimile  number  databases,  when  consumers  subsequently  transact  business,  file 
 applications  or  make  inquiries. 
 4.  Identification  Requirements  and  Opt-  Out  Notice 
 33.  As  noted  in  the  JFPA  NPRM,  the  Commission’s  existing  rules  require  senders  of  facsimile  messages  to  identify  themselves  on  the  message,  along  with  the  telephone  number  of  the 


 sending  machine  or  the  business,  other  entity,  or  individual  sending  the  message.  122  The  TCPA  also  requires  facsimile  messages  to  include  the  date  and  time  they  are  sent.  123  We  sought  comment  on  the 
 interplay  between  this  identification  requirement  and  the  opt-  out  notice  requirement  under  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act.  124  A  few  commenters  identified  additional  burdens  associated  with  complying  separately 
 with  both  requirements.  125  We  conclude  that  senders  that  provide  their  telephone  number  and  facsimile  number  as  part  of  the  opt-  out  notice  will  satisfy  the  Commission’s  identification  rule  so  long  as  they  also 
 identify  themselves  by  name  on  the  facsimile  advertisement. 
 D.  Request  to  Opt-  Out  of  Future  Unsolicited  Advertisements 
 34.  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  that  a  request  not  to  send  future  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  meet  certain  requirements.  126  In  accordance  with  the  statutory  provisions,  we 


 120  See  supra,  para.  20. 
 121  See  AGs  Comments  at  23  (a  do-  not-  fax  request  must  be  honored  until  the  recipient  gives  express  consent  to 
 receive  solicitations). 
 122  JFPA  NPRM,  para.  17.  See  also  47  C.  F.  R.  §  68.318(  d).  We  note  that  the  “sender”  of  the  facsimile 
 advertisement  is  the  person  on  whose  behalf  the  advertisement  is  sent.  Under  the  Commission’s  rules,  the  fax  broadcaster  must  also  identify  itself  if  it  demonstrates  a  high  degree  of  involvement  in  the  sender’s  facsimile 


 messages,  such  as  supplying  the  numbers  to  which  a  message  is  sent.  See  47  C.  F.  R.  §  68.318(  d).  Verizon  urges  the  Commission  to  amend  its  current  Caller  Identification  (Caller  ID)  rules  to  require  that  fax  broadcasters 
 transmit  the  same  caller  ID  information  that  is  currently  required  of  telemarketers.  Verizon  alleges  that  there  is  a  growing  trend  by  fax  broadcasters  to  engage  in  “caller  ID  spoofing,”  whereby  they  manipulate  their  caller  ID  data 
 to  disguise  the  true  telephone  number  from  which  the  calls  have  been  placed.  See  Verizon  Comments  at  1.  Although  outside  the  scope  of  the  NPRM,  we  will  monitor  caller  ID  spoofing  to  determine  whether  action  is 
 warranted  to  address  the  practice  in  the  future.

 adopt  rules  requiring  that  an  opt-  out  request  identify  the  telephone  number  or  numbers  of  the  facsimile  machines  or  machines  to  which  the  request  relates.  In  addition,  the  request  must  be  made  using  the 
 telephone  number,  facsimile  number,  website  address  or  email  address  provided  by  the  sender  in  its  opt-out  notice.  Most  commenters  argue  that  permitting  opt-  out  requests  to  be  made  through  other  avenues  not 
 identified  in  the  notice  will  impair  an  entity’s  ability  to  account  for  all  requests  and  process  them  in  a  timely  manner.  127  As  discussed  above,  the  sender  is  required  to  include  a  telephone  number  and  facsimile 
 number  on  the  advertisement,  and  if  neither  numbers  are  cost-  free  (i.  e.,  they  are  not  800  toll-  free  numbers  or  local  numbers  for  local  recipients),  then  the  sender  must  have  a  website  or  email  address  to  permit 
 recipients  to  opt-  out  of  future  facsimile  messages.  Requiring  recipients  to  use  one  of  the  methods  identified  on  the  facsimile  should  reasonably  permit  any  consumer  to  avoid  future  facsimile  messages 
 from  the  sender.  Under  the  new  rules,  the  sender  will  be  prohibited  from  sending  facsimile  advertisements  to  a  person  that  has  submitted  a  request  that  complies  with  these  requirements.  128 


 1.  Interplay  Between  Established  Business  Relationship  Exemption  and  Opt-  Out  Request 
 35.  We  agree  with  the  majority  of  commenters  that  an  opt-  out  request  should  be  honored  irrespective  of  whether  the  recipient  continues  to  do  business  with  the  sender.  129  Therefore,  our  rules  will 


 reflect  that  a  do-  not-  fax  request  will  terminate  the  EBR  exemption  from  the  prohibition  on  sending  facsimile  advertisements.  130  This  determination  is  consistent  with  the  Commission’s  rules  on  telephone 
 solicitations,  whereby  a  telephone  subscriber’s  seller-  specific  do-  not-  call  request  terminates  any  EBR  exemption  with  that  company  even  if  the  subscriber  continues  to  do  business  with  the  seller.  131 


 36.  As  set  forth  in  the  statute,  a  sender  may  resume  sending  facsimile  advertisements  to  a  consumer  that  has  opted-  out  of  such  communications  if  that  consumer  subsequently  provides  his  express 
 invitation  or  permission  to  the  sender.  132  Of  the  comments  received  on  this  issue,  most  agree  that  when  a  consumer  has  made  an  opt-  out  request  of  the  sender,  it  should  be  up  to  the  sender  to  demonstrate  that  the 


 (Continued  from  previous  page)  to  such  request,  provided  express  invitation  or  permission  to  the  sender,  in  writing  or  otherwise,  to  send  such 
 advertisements  to  such  person  at  such  telephone  facsimile  machine”).

 by  which  a  fax  advertiser  must  accept  a  do-  not-  fax  request  when  there  are  no  such  restrictions  in  the  telemarketing  context).  We  encourage  senders  that  are  on  actual  notice  of  a  recipient’s  opt-  out  request  to  honor  the  request  even 
 if  not  sent  by  the  methods  identified  in  the  sender’s  opt-  out  notice.

 consumer  subsequently  gave  his  express  permission  to  receive  faxes.  133  As  discussed  in  more  detail  below,  our  rules  will  permit  such  permission  to  be  granted  in  writing  or  orally.  134  Senders  that  claim  their 
 facsimile  advertisements  are  delivered  based  on  the  recipient’s  prior  express  permission  must  be  prepared  to  provide  clear  and  convincing  evidence  of  the  existence  of  such  permission. 


 2.  Third  Parties  and  Fax  Broadcasters 
 37.  The  record  reveals  that  fax  broadcasters,  135  which  transmit  other  entities’  advertisements  to  telephone  facsimile  machines  for  a  fee,  are  responsible  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  facsimile 


 messages  sent  today.  136  The  Commission  sought  comment  in  the  JFPA  NPRM  on  whether  to  specify  that  if  the  entity  transmitting  the  facsimile  advertisement  is  a  third  party  agent  or  fax  broadcaster,  that  any  do-not- 
 fax  request  sent  to  that  agent  will  extend  to  the  underlying  business  on  whose  behalf  the  fax  is  transmitted.  137  The  majority  of  commenters  maintain  that  a  third  party  should  not  be  responsible  under 
 the  law  for  accepting  and  communicating  opt-  out  requests  to  senders.  138  Some  commenters  argue  that  to  hold  third  parties  responsible  for  processing  opt-  out  requests  will  unduly  restrict  any  third  party’s  ability 
 to  send  faxes  to  consumers  on  behalf  of  other  entities.  139 
 38.  We  conclude  that  the  sender—  the  business  on  whose  behalf  the  fax  is  transmitted—  is  responsible  for  complying  with  the  opt-  out  notice  requirements  and  for  honoring  opt-  out  requests. 


 Regardless  of  whether  the  sender  includes  its  own  contact  information  in  the  opt-  out  notice  or  the  contact  information  of  a  third  party  retained  to  accept  opt-  out  requests,  the  sender  is  liable  for  any  violations  of 
 the  rules.  This  determination  is  consistent  with  the  Commission’s  telemarketing  rules.  140  Third  parties,  including  fax  broadcasters,  need  only  accept  and  forward  do-  not-  fax  requests  to  the  extent  the  underlying

 NAWD  Comments  at  13  (given  the  private  right  of  action,  it  would  be  imprudent  to  rely  on  the  recipient  to  prove  that  his  opt-  out  had  been  superseded).

 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  06-  42

 business  contracts  out  such  responsibilities  to  them. 
 39.  We  take  this  opportunity  to  emphasize  that  under  the  Commission’s  interpretation  of  the  facsimile  advertising  rules,  the  sender  is  the  person  or  entity  on  whose  behalf  the  advertisement  is  sent.  141 


 In  most  instances,  this  will  be  the  entity  whose  product  or  service  is  advertised  or  promoted  in  the  message.  As  discussed  above,  the  sender  is  liable  for  violations  of  the  facsimile  advertising  rules, 
 including  failure  to  honor  opt-  out  requests.  Accordingly,  we  adopt  a  definition  of  sender  for  purposes  of  the  facsimile  advertising  rules.  142 


 40.  Under  the  current  rules,  a  fax  broadcaster  also  will  be  liable  for  an  unsolicited  fax  if  it  demonstrates  a  high  degree  of  involvement  in,  or  actual  notice  of,  the  unlawful  activity  and  fails  to  take 
 steps  to  prevent  such  facsimile  advertisements,  and  we  will  continue  to  apply  this  standard  under  our  revised  rules.  143  If  the  fax  broadcaster  supplies  the  fax  numbers  used  to  transmit  the  advertisement,  for 
 example,  the  fax  broadcaster  will  be  liable  for  any  unsolicited  advertisements  faxed  to  consumers  and  businesses  without  their  prior  express  invitation  or  permission.  144  We  find  that  a  fax  broadcaster  that 
 provides  a  source  of  fax  numbers,  makes  representations  about  the  legality  of  faxing  to  those  numbers  or  advises  a  client  about  how  to  comply  with  the  fax  advertising  rules,  also  demonstrates  a  high  degree  of 
 involvement  in  the  transmission  of  those  facsimile  advertisements.  In  addition,  we  conclude  that  a  highly  involved  fax  broadcaster  will  be  liable  for  an  unsolicited  fax  that  does  not  contain  the  required  notice  and 
 contact  information.  145  In  such  circumstances,  the  sender  and  fax  broadcaster  may  be  held  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  violations  of  the  opt-  out  notice  requirements.  Based  on  our  own  enforcement 
 experience,  and  the  fact  that  highly  involved  fax  broadcasters  will  have  firsthand  knowledge  of  the  inclusion  of  the  opt-  out  notice,  we  determine  that  such  a  fax  broadcaster  must,  at  a  minimum,  ensure  that 
 the  faxes  it  transmits  on  behalf  of  each  sender  contain  the  necessary  information  to  allow  a  consumer  to  opt  out  of  a  particular  sender’s  faxes  in  the  future.  Otherwise,  the  consumer  may  have  no  means  of 
 stopping  unwanted  faxes  transmitted  by  the  fax  broadcaster  on  behalf  of  various  advertisers. 
 E.  Professional  or  Trade  Organizations 
 41.  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  authorizes  the  Commission  to  consider  exempting  nonprofit  organizations  from  the  opt-  out  notice  requirements  discussed  above.  146  Specifically,  the  statute  provides 


 141  NAR  Comments  at  12  (asking  the  Commission  to  clarify  the  definition  of  “sender”);  ABM  Comments  at  10  (a 
 definition  of  “sender”  would  help  distinguish  between  the  business  on  whose  behalf  the  fax  is  sent  and  a  vendor  who  does  nothing  more  than  transmit  a  fax).

 registered  to  conduct  business  with  the  State  Corporation  Commission  (or  comparable  regulatory  authority),  must  be  identified  on  the  facsimile,  along  with  the  sender’s  name.”)  See  also  AGs  Comments  at  29.

 that  the  Commission  may,  after  receiving  public  comment,  allow  professional  or  trade  associations  that  are  tax-  exempt  nonprofit  organizations  to  send  unsolicited  advertisements  to  their  members  in  furtherance 
 of  the  association’s  tax-  exempt  purpose  that  do  not  contain  the  opt-  out  notice.  147  The  statute  requires  that  the  Commission  first  determine  that  such  notice  is  not  necessary  to  protect  the  ability  of  the  members  of 
 such  associations  to  stop  such  associations  from  sending  any  future  unsolicited  advertisements.  148  We  sought  comment  on  whether  to  allow  such  organizations  to  send  faxes  that  do  not  contain  the  opt-  out 
 notice.  149  We  asked  how  members  would  obtain  the  necessary  information  to  stop  unwanted  faxes  if  the  associations  do  not  provide  such  information,  and  we  asked  what  benefits  there  are  to  nonprofit 
 organizations  if  they  are  exempt  from  the  opt-  out  notice  requirement.  150 
 42.  Most  commenters  that  are  themselves  trade  associations  or  professional  organizations  argue  that  they  exist  to  serve  their  members,  and  that  members  of  an  association  know  how  to  contact 


 those  associations  should  they  no  longer  wish  to  receive  fax  messages.  151  They  contend  that  most  trade  associations  have  a  membership  or  customer  service  department  that  can  assist  the  member  with  an  opt-out 
 request.  152  Other  commenters  oppose  an  exemption  for  nonprofits,  arguing  that  such  organizations  should  have  no  difficulty  including  an  opt-  out  notice  on  their  facsimile  advertisements.  153  We  are  not 
 persuaded  that  consumers  will  have  the  necessary  tools  to  easily  opt-  out  of  unwanted  faxes  from  trade 
 (Continued  from  previous  page)  nonprofit  organizations  to  send  unsolicited  advertisements  to  their  members  in  furtherance  of  the  association’s

 associations  if  the  faxes  received  do  not  contain  information  on  how  to  opt  out.  Moreover,  we  believe  the  benefits  to  consumers  of  having  opt-  out  information  readily  available  outweigh  any  burden  in  including 
 such  notices.  154  Facsimile  advertisements  impose  direct  costs  on  consumers  for  paper,  toner,  and  time  spent  sorting  and  discarding  unwanted  faxes.  Should  consumers  not  have  access  to  opt-  out  contact 
 information,  they  may  be  forced  to  incur  unacceptable  costs  associated  with  faxes  sent  from  nonprofit  organizations.  In  addition,  the  record  reveals  that  trade  associations  already  have  mechanisms  in  place 
 through  which  members  communicate  with  the  organization.  155  Therefore,  inclusion  of  an  opt-  out  notice  on  their  fax  messages  should  not  be  burdensome. 


 43.  While  neither  the  TCPA  nor  its  amendments  carve  out  an  exemption  for  nonprofits  from  the  facsimile  advertising  rules,  we  agree  with  those  petitioners  that  argue  that  messages  that  are  not 
 commercial  in  nature—  which  many  nonprofits  send—  do  not  constitute  “unsolicited  advertisements”  and  are  therefore  not  covered  by  the  facsimile  advertising  prohibition.  156  We  clarify  that  messages  that  do  not 
 promote  a  commercial  product  or  service,  including  all  messages  involving  political  or  religious  discourse,  such  as  a  request  for  a  donation  to  a  political  campaign,  political  action  committee  or  charitable 
 organization,  are  not  unsolicited  advertisements  under  the  TCPA.  157  We  emphasize  that,  under  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  even  unsolicited  advertisements  transmitted  by  tax-  exempt  nonprofit  organizations 
 may  be  sent  to  persons  with  whom  the  senders  have  an  established  business  relationship,  subject  to  the  other  statutory  requirements. 


 F.  Unsolicited  Advertisement 
 1.  Definition 
 44.  The  facsimile  advertising  rules  apply  to  a  fax  communication  that  constitutes  an  “unsolicited  advertisement”  as  defined  in  the  TCPA.  158  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  amends  the  term 


 “unsolicited  advertisement”  by  adding  “in  writing  or  otherwise”  before  the  period  at  the  end  of  that 


 154  We  note  that  the  opt-  out  notice  requirement  only  applies  to  communications  that  constitute  unsolicited 
 advertisements.

 156  See,  e.  g.,  ASAE  Petition  for  Reconsideration,  filed  July  25,  2003;  Consumer  Electronics  Association  Petition

 carving  out  an  exemption  for  tax-  exempt  nonprofits.  Rather,  consistent  with  the  language  of  the  TCPA,  we  do  not  intend  for  the  clarifications  in  this  Order  to  result  in  the  regulation  of  noncommercial  speech  as  commercial 
 facsimile  messages  under  the  TCPA  regulatory  scheme.  157 
 See  American  Dietetic  Association  Petition  at  8,  filed  August  25,  2003;  National  Association  of  Business  PACs  Petition  at  7-  8,  filed  August  25,  2003.  Under  the  Federal  Election  Commission’s  rules,  when  a  person  pays 


 a  political  committee  for  a  commercially  available  product  or  service,  such  as  a  dinner  sponsored  by  a  political  campaign,  the  full  purchase  price  of  the  item  or  service  is  considered  a  contribution  to  the  campaign.  See  FEC 
 Comments  at  2-  3,  filed  October  14,  2003.  Therefore,  the  fact  that  a  political  message  contains  an  offer  to  attend  a  fundraising  dinner  or  to  purchase  some  other  product  or  service  in  connection  with  a  political  campaign  or 
 committee  fundraiser  does  not  turn  the  message  into  an  advertisement  for  purposes  of  the  TCPA’s  facsimile  advertising  rules.

 section.  159  We  proposed  amending  the  Commission’s  rules  to  reflect  the  change  in  the  statutory  language.  160  No  commenter  opposed  the  modification.  Accordingly,  we  amend  our  rules  at 
 64.1200(  f)(  10)  so  that  the  definition  reads  as  follows: 
 The  term  unsolicited  advertisement  means  any  material  advertising  the  commercial  availability  or  quality  of  any  property,  goods,  or  services  which  is  transmitted  to  any 


 person  without  the  person’s  prior  express  invitation  or  permission,  in  writing  or  otherwise.  161 


 2.  Prior  Express  Invitation  or  Permission 
 45.  Several  commenters  ask  the  Commission  to  explicitly  recognize  that  “prior  express  invitation  or  permission”  to  send  a  facsimile  advertisement  may  be  obtained  by  means  other  than  a  signed 


 written  statement.  162  CBA  urges  the  Commission  not  to  specify  the  various  other  means,  for  fear  that  the  Commission  might  overlook  certain  legitimate  methods  and  forms  of  permission.  163  We  clarify  that,  as  an 
 initial  matter,  a  sender  that  has  an  EBR  with  a  consumer  may  send  a  facsimile  advertisement  to  that  consumer  without  obtaining  separate  permission  from  him.  164  In  the  absence  of  an  EBR,  the  sender  must 
 obtain  the  prior  express  invitation  or  permission  from  the  consumer  before  sending  the  facsimile  advertisement.  165  Prior  express  invitation  or  permission  may  be  given  by  oral  or  written  means,  including 
 electronic  methods.  166  We  expect  that  written  permission  will  take  many  forms,  including  email,  facsimile,  and  internet  form.  Whether  given  orally  or  in  writing,  prior  express  invitation  or  permission 
 must  be  express,  must  be  given  prior  to  the  sending  of  any  facsimile  advertisements,  and  must  include  the  facsimile  number  to  which  such  advertisements  may  be  sent.  167  It  cannot  be  in  the  form  of  a  “negative 
 option.”  168  However,  a  company  that  requests  a  fax  number  on  an  application  form  could  include  a  clear  statement  indicating  that,  by  providing  such  fax  number,  the  individual  or  business  agrees  to  receive

 163  CBA  Comments  at  14-  15;  see  also  YPA  Comments  at  7. 
 164  As  discussed  above,  a  sender  that  has  received  an  opt-  out  request  from  a  consumer  must  not  continue  to  send 
 facsimile  advertisements  regardless  of  whether  there  exists  a  business  relationship  between  them. 
 165  See  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  b)(  1)(  C)  and  (a)(  4). 


 166  As  discussed  above,  we  are  removing  the  Commission’s  rule  at  section  64.1200(  a)(  3)(  i)  which  requires  the 
 recipient  to  obtain  a  signed,  written  statement  indicating  the  recipient’s  consent  to  receive  facsimile  advertisements  from  the  sender.  See  supra,  para.  11,  n.  38.

 168  A  facsimile  advertisement  containing  a  telephone  number  and  an  instruction  to  call  if  the  recipient  no  longer 
 wishes  to  receive  such  faxes,  would  constitute  a  “negative  option”  as  the  sender  presumes  consent  unless  advised  otherwise.

 facsimile  advertisements  from  that  company  or  organization.  169 
 46.  We  are  concerned  that  permission  not  provided  in  writing  may  result  in  some  senders  erroneously  claiming  they  had  the  recipient’s  permission  to  send  facsimile  advertisements.  Commenters 


 that  discussed  this  issue  agree  that  a  sender  should  have  the  obligation  to  demonstrate  that  it  complied  with  the  rules,  including  that  it  had  the  recipient’s  prior  express  invitation  or  permission.  170  Senders  who 
 choose  to  obtain  permission  orally  are  expected  to  take  reasonable  steps  to  ensure  that  such  permission  can  be  verified.  In  the  event  a  complaint  is  filed,  the  burden  of  proof  rests  on  the  sender  to  demonstrate 
 that  permission  was  given.  171  We  strongly  suggest  that  senders  take  steps  to  promptly  document  that  they  received  such  permission.  172  Express  permission  need  only  be  secured  once  from  the  consumer  in  order 
 to  send  facsimile  advertisements  to  that  recipient  until  the  consumer  revokes  such  permission  by  sending  an  opt-  out  request  to  the  sender. 


 47.  The  record  on  the  facsimile  advertising  rules  has  long  reflected  the  fact  that  consumers  incur  costs  for  receiving  fax  communications.  173  Recipients  assume  the  cost  of  the  paper  used,  the  cost 
 associated  with  the  use  of  the  facsimile  machine,  and  the  costs  associated  with  the  time  spent  receiving  a  facsimile  advertisement  during  which  the  machine  cannot  be  used  by  its  owner  to  send  or  receive  other 
 facsimile  transmissions.  174  We  therefore  conclude  that,  in  the  absence  of  an  EBR,  facsimile  requests  for  permission  to  transmit  faxed  advertisements  would  not  be  permissible,  as  they  would  impose  costs  on 
 consumers  who  had  not  yet  consented  to  receive  such  communications.  175 
 48.  Senders  who  claim  they  obtained  a  consumer’s  prior  express  invitation  or  permission  to  send  them  facsimile  advertisements  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  these  rules  will  not  be  in  compliance 


 unless  they  can  demonstrate  that  such  authorization  met  all  the  requirements  as  adopted  herein.  In  addition,  entities  that  send  facsimile  advertisements  to  consumers  from  whom  they  obtained  permission, 
 must  include  on  the  advertisements  their  opt-  out  notice  and  contact  information  to  allow  consumers  to  stop  unwanted  faxes  in  the  future. 


 3.  “Transactional”  Communications 
 49.  We  agree  with  those  petitioners  who  argue  that  messages  whose  purpose  is  to  facilitate, 
 169  Trade  and  membership  organizations  could  do  so  on  their  membership  renewal  statements. 
 170  Westfax  Comments  at  10;  McKenna  Comments  at  2;  YPA  comments  at  2  (maintaining  that  the  Commission 
 should  be  flexible  as  to  the  evidence  necessary  to  prove  the  recipient  granted  permission  to  receive  the  fax). 
 171  See  Sauchau  Comments;  AGs  Comments  at  26. 


 172  An  example  of  such  documentation  could  be  the  recording  of  the  oral  authorization.  Other  methods  might 
 include  established  business  practices  or  contact  forms  used  by  the  sender’s  personnel. 
 173  See  2003  TCPA  Order,  18  FCC  Rcd  at  14127-  28,  para.  189;  see  also  AGs  Comments  at  4-  5,  20;  McKenna

 175  This  finding  is  also  consistent  with  our  telemarketing  and  CAN-  SPAM  rules  for  wireless  devices,  which  do  not 
 permit  the  calling  or  text  messaging  to  obtain  prior  express  permission.

 complete,  or  confirm  a  commercial  transaction  that  the  recipient  has  previously  agreed  to  enter  into  with  the  sender  are  not  advertisements  for  purposes  of  the  TCPA’s  facsimile  advertising  rules.  176  For  example, 
 a  receipt  or  invoice,  the  primary  purpose  of  which  is  to  confirm  the  purchase  of  certain  items  by  the  facsimile  recipient,  is  not  an  advertisement  of  the  commercial  availability  of  such  items.  Similarly, 
 messages  containing  account  balance  information  or  other  type  of  account  statement  which,  for  instance,  notify  the  recipient  of  a  change  in  terms  or  features  regarding  an  account,  subscription,  membership,  loan 
 or  comparable  ongoing  relationship,  in  which  the  recipient  has  already  purchased  or  is  currently  using  the  facsimile  sender’s  product  or  service,  is  not  an  advertisement.  Communications  sent  to  facilitate  a  loan 
 transaction,  such  as  property  appraisals,  summary  of  closing  costs,  disclosures  (such  as  the  Good  Faith  Estimate)  and  other  similar  documents  are  not  advertisements  when  their  purpose  is  to  complete  the 
 financial  transaction.  177  A  travel  itinerary  for  a  trip  a  customer  has  agreed  to  take  or  is  in  the  process  of  negotiating  is  not  an  unsolicited  advertisement.  Similarly,  a  contract  to  be  signed  and  returned  by  the 
 agent  or  traveler  that  is  for  the  purpose  of  closing  a  travel  deal  is  not  an  advertisement  for  purposes  of  the  prohibition.  178  A  communication  from  a  trade  show  organizer  to  an  exhibitor  regarding  the  show  and  her 
 appearance  will  not  be  considered  an  unsolicited  advertisement,  provided  the  exhibitor  has  already  agreed  to  appear.  179  We  also  conclude  that  a  mortgage  rate  sheet  sent  to  a  broker  or  other  intermediary  or  a  price 
 list  sent  from  a  wholesaler  to  a  distributor  (e.  g.,  food  wholesaler  to  a  grocery  store)  for  the  purpose  of  communicating  the  terms  on  which  a  transaction  has  already  occurred  are  not  advertisements.  180  A 
 subscription  renewal  notice  would  be  considered  “transactional”  in  nature,  provided  the  recipient  is  a  current  subscriber  and  had  affirmatively  subscribed  to  the  publication.  Finally,  a  notice  soliciting  bid 
 proposals  on  a  construction  project  would  not  be  subject  to  the  facsimile  advertising  prohibition,  provided  the  notice  does  not  otherwise  contain  offers  for  products,  goods,  and  services.  Similarly,  bids  in  response 
 to  specific  solicitations  would  not  be  covered  by  the  rules,  as  such  communications  are  presumably  to  facilitate  a  commercial  transaction  that  the  recipient  has  agreed  to  enter  into  by  soliciting  the  bids. 


 50.  In  order  for  such  messages  to  fall  outside  the  definition  of  “unsolicited  advertisement,”  they  must  relate  specifically  to  existing  accounts  and  ongoing  transactions.  Messages  regarding  new  or 
 additional  business  would  advertise  “the  commercial  availability  or  quality  of  any  property,  goods,  or  services…”  and  therefore  would  be  covered  by  the  prohibition.  181  Thus,  applications  and  materials 
 regarding  educational  opportunities  and  conferences  sent  to  persons  who  are  not  yet  participating  or  enrolled  in  such  programs  are  unsolicited  advertisements  and  require  the  recipient’s  permission  or  the 


 176  See,  e.  g.,  Wells  Fargo  Petition  for  Reconsideration,  filed  August  25,  2003;  Reed  Elsevier  Petition  for 
 Reconsideration,  filed  August  25,  2003;  Proximity  Marketing  Request  for  Clarification,  filed  August  25,  2003;  Financial  Services  Coalition  Petition  for  Reconsideration  at  6-  7,  filed  August  25,  2003. 


 177  See  Financial  Services  Coalition  Petition  for  Reconsideration  at  4-  7,  filed  August  25,  2003. 
 178  However,  we  find  that  messages  regarding  travel  deals,  bonus  commission  offers  and  other  promotional 
 information  are  advertisements  and  would  require  the  recipient’s  express  permission  in  the  absence  of  an  established  business  relationship.  See  Travel  Industry  Group  Petition  for  Reconsideration  at  4,  6,  filed  August  25, 


 2003.  179 
 See,  e.  g.,  Reed  Elsevier  Petition  for  Reconsideration  at  4,  filed  August  25,  2003.  180 
 Commercial  facsimile  messages  that  advertise  the  commercial  availability  or  quality  of  property,  goods,  or  services,  but  purport  to  be  “price  sheets”  or  “rate  sheets”  in  order  to  evade  the  TCPA  rules,  are  nevertheless 


 unsolicited  advertisements,  if  not  sent  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating,  completing,  or  confirming  an  ongoing  transaction. 
 181  See  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  a)(  4). 
27
 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  06-  42 
 28 
 existence  of  an  established  business  relationship  before  faxing  the  recipient  such  information.  182  Similarly,  a  rate  sheet  on  financial  products  transmitted  to  a  potential  borrower  or  potential  brokers  would 
 not  be  considered  merely  “transactional”  in  nature  and  would  require  the  sender  to  either  have  an  established  business  relationship  with  the  recipient  or  first  obtain  express  permission  from  the  recipient. 


 51.  In  response  to  arguments  that  a  de  minimis  amount  of  advertising  information  should  not  convert  a  communication  into  an  “unsolicited  advertisement,”  183  we  conclude  that  a  reference  to  a 
 commercial  entity  does  not  by  itself  make  a  message  a  commercial  message.  For  example,  a  company  logo  or  business  slogan  found  on  an  account  statement  would  not  convert  the  communication  into  an 
 advertisement,  so  long  as  the  primary  purpose  of  the  communication  is,  for  example,  to  relay  account  information  to  the  fax  recipient.  184 


 4.  Offers  for  Free  Goods  and  Services  and  Informational  Messages 
 52.  We  conclude  that  facsimile  messages  that  promote  goods  or  services  even  at  no  cost,  such  as  free  magazine  subscriptions,  catalogs,  or  free  consultations  or  seminars,  are  unsolicited  advertisements 


 under  the  TCPA’s  definition.  185  In  many  instances,  “free”  seminars  serve  as  a  pretext  to  advertise  commercial  products  and  services.  Similarly,  “free”  publications  are  often  part  of  an  overall  marketing 
 campaign  to  sell  property,  goods,  or  services.  For  instance,  while  the  publication  itself  may  be  offered  at  no  cost  to  the  fascimile  recipient,  the  products  promoted  within  the  publication  are  often  commercially 
 available.  Based  on  this,  it  is  reasonable  to  presume  that  such  messages  describe  the  “quality  of  any  property,  goods,  or  services.”  186  Therefore,  facsimile  communications  regarding  such  free  goods  and 
 services,  if  not  purely  “transactional,”  would  require  the  sender  to  obtain  the  recipient’s  permission  beforehand,  in  the  absence  of  an  EBR. 


 53.  By  contrast,  facsimile  communications  that  contain  only  information,  such  as  industry  news  articles,  legislative  updates,  or  employee  benefit  information,  would  not  be  prohibited  by  the  TCPA 
 rules.  An  incidental  advertisement  contained  in  a  newsletter  does  not  convert  the  entire  communication  into  an  advertisement.  187  Thus,  a  trade  organization’s  newsletter  sent  via  facsimile  would  not  constitute 


 182  Such  communications  nevertheless  could  be  sent  to  recipients  with  whom  the  sender  has  an  EBR,  so  long  as 
 they  also  comply  with  the  other  statutory  provisions,  including  the  opt-  out  notice  requirements.

 Group  Petition  for  Reconsideration  at  14,  filed  August  25,  2003.  184 
 See  Wells  Fargo  Petition  for  Reconsideration  at  3,  filed  August  25,  2003;  Travel  Industry  Group  Petition  for  Reconsideration  at  14,  filed  August  25,  2003.

 186  See  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  a)(  4). 
 187  See  Air  Conditioning  Contractors  Petition  for  Reconsideration  at  2-  3,  filed  August  12,  2003.  In  determining 
 whether  an  advertisement  is  incidental  to  an  informational  communication,  the  Commission  will  consider,  among  other  factors,  whether  the  advertisement  is  to  a  bona  fide  “informational  communication.”  In  determining  whether 


 the  advertisement  is  to  a  bona  fide  “informational  communication,”  the  Commission  will  consider  whether  the  communication  is  issued  on  a  regular  schedule;  whether  the  text  of  the  communication  changes  from  issue  to 
 issue;  and  whether  the  communication  is  directed  to  specific  regular  recipients,  i.  e.,  to  paid  subscribers  or  to  recipients  who  have  initiated  membership  in  the  organization  that  sends  the  communication.  We  may  also 
 consider  the  amount  of  space  devoted  to  advertising  versus  the  amount  of  space  used  for  information  or  “transactional”  messages  and  whether  the  advertising  is  on  behalf  of  the  sender  of  the  communication,  such  as  an

 an  unsolicited  advertisement,  so  long  as  the  newsletter’s  primary  purpose  is  informational,  rather  than  to  promote  commercial  products.  We  emphasize  that  a  newsletter  format  used  to  advertise  products  or 
 services  will  not  protect  a  sender  from  liability  for  delivery  of  an  unsolicited  advertisement  under  the  TCPA  and  the  Commission’s  rules.  We  will  review  such  newsletters  on  a  case-  by-  case  basis  should  they 
 be  brought  to  our  attention. 
 54.  Finally,  we  conclude  that  any  surveys  that  serve  as  a  pretext  to  an  advertisement  are  subject  to  the  TCPA’s  facsimile  advertising  rules.  188  The  TCPA’s  definition  of  “unsolicited 


 advertisement”  applies  to  any  communication  that  advertises  the  commercial  availability  or  quality  of  property,  goods  or  services,  even  if  the  message  purports  to  be  conducting  a  survey.  189 


 5.  Petitions  for  Reconsideration  on  EBR  exemption 
 55.  We  also  take  this  opportunity  to  dismiss  as  moot,  any  pending  petitions,  or  parts  thereof,  that  seek  reconsideration  of  the  Commission’s  determination  that  an  established  business  relationship  will 


 no  longer  be  sufficient  to  show  that  an  individual  or  business  has  given  prior  express  permission  to  receive  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  and  those  that  seek  reconsideration  of  the  written  permission 
 requirement  in  section  64.1200(  a)(  3)(  i)  of  the  Commission’s  rules.  190  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  codifies  an  established  business  relationship  exception  to  the  prohibition  on  sending  unsolicited  facsimile 
 advertisements;  therefore,  such  petitions  are  now  moot.  191 
 G.  Private  Right  of  Action 
 56.  The  TCPA  provides  consumers  with  a  private  right  of  action  in  state  court  for  any  violation  of  the  TCPA’s  prohibitions  on  the  use  of  automatic  dialing  systems,  artificial  or  prerecorded 


 voice  messages,  and  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements.  192  Westfax  raises  concerns  about  class  action  lawsuits  brought  under  the  TCPA  and  asks  the  Commission  to  clarify  the  parameters  of  the  private  right 
 of  action.  193  As  the  Commission  has  stated  in  previous  orders,  Congress  provided  consumers  with  a  private  right  of  action,  “if  otherwise  permitted  by  the  laws  or  rules  of  court  of  a  State.”  This  language 
 suggests  that  Congress  contemplated  that  such  legal  action  was  a  matter  for  consumers  to  pursue  in  appropriate  state  courts,  subject  to  those  state  courts’  rules.  194  We  continue  to  believe  that  it  is  for 
 Congress,  not  the  Commission,  either  to  clarify  or  limit  this  right  of  action.  Therefore,  we  decline  to  make  any  determinations  about  the  specific  contours  of  the  private  right  of  action.

 H.  Effective  Date  of  Rules 
 57.  The  record  reveals  that  facsimile  senders  may  need  additional  time  beyond  30  days  to  comply  with  the  rules  adopted  herein.  195  For  example,  senders  will  need  to  ensure  that  opt-  out  contact 


 information  is  provided  on  all  facsimile  advertisements.  They  also  will  need  to  put  in  place  mechanisms  to  allow  recipients  to  opt-  out  of  unwanted  facsimile  advertisements  and  establish  procedures  for  removing 
 facsimile  numbers  for  individuals  that  have  opted  out  of  such  advertisements.  We  believe  it  is  important  to  provide  adequate  time  for  senders  to  come  into  compliance  with  the  rules  adopted  in  this  order. 
 Therefore,  the  amended  facsimile  advertising  rules  will  become  effective  within  90  days  of  date  of  publication  in  the  Federal  Register.  196 


 I.  Filings  in  Response  to  this  Order 
 58.  The  Commission  recently  opened  a  new  docket—  CG  Docket  No.  05-  338—  and  asked  that  all  filings  addressing  the  facsimile  advertising  rules  be  filed  in  the  new  docket.  197  Any  filings  in 


 response  to  this  Report  and  Order  also  should  be  filed  in  CG  Docket  No.  05-  338. 
 IV.  PROCEDURAL  ISSUES 
 A.  Paperwork  Reduction  Act 
 59.  The  Report  and  Order  contains  new  information  collection  requirements  subject  to  the  Paperwork  Reduction  Act  of  1995  (PRA),  Public  Law  104-  13.  It  will  be  submitted  to  the  Office  of 


 Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  for  review  under  Section  3507(  d)  of  the  PRA.  OMB,  the  general  public,  and  other  Federal  agencies  are  invited  to  comment  on  the  new  information  collection  requirements 
 contained  in  this  proceeding. 
 60.  In  addition,  pursuant  to  the  Small  Business  Paperwork  Review  Act  of  2002,  Public  Law  No.  107-  198,  see  44  U.  S.  C.  §  3506(  c)(  4),  in  this  present  document  we  have  assessed  the  effect  of  rule 


 changes  and  find  that  there  likely  will  be  an  increased  administrative  burden  on  businesses  with  fewer  than  25  employees.  We  have  taken  steps  to  minimize  the  information  collection  burden  for  small 
 business  concerns,  including  those  with  fewer  than  25  employees.  The  rules  adopted  herein  do  not  to  require  the  maintenance  of  specific  records  for  the  sending  of  facsimile  advertisements.  We  also  decline 
 to  limit  the  duration  of  the  EBR  which  might  have  resulted  in  an  increase  in  recordkeeping  burden  for  entities  sending  fax  advertisements  on  the  basis  of  an  EBR.  These  measures  should  substantially  alleviate 
 any  burdens  on  businesses  with  fewer  than  25  employees. 
 B.  Congressional  Review  Act 
 61.  The  Commission  will  send  a  copy  of  this  Report  and  Order  and  Third  Order  on  Reconsideration  in  a  report  to  be  sent  to  Congress  and  the  Government  Accountability  Office  pursuant  to 


 195  Huntington  Natl  Bank  at  8  (suggesting  a  one-  year  compliance  period);  SHRM  Comments  at  10  (supports  a  90- 
 day  period  for  organizations  to  come  into  compliance);  CBA  Comments  at  16  (suggesting  a  year) 
 196  Those  rules  requiring  OMB  approval  under  the  Paperwork  Reduction  Act  are  not  effective  until  approved  by 
 OMB.

 Subpart  L  –  Restrictions  on  Telemarketing,  Telephone  Solicitation,  and  Facsimile  Advertising 


 *  *  *  *  * 
 3.  Section  64.1200  is  amended  to  remove  paragraph  (a)(  3)(  i). 
 *  *  *  *  * 
 4.  Section  64.1200  is  amended  by  removing  the  note  for  paragraph  (f)(  3)  that  reads  as  follows: 
 Paragraph  64.1200(  f)(  3)  is  stayed  as  of  October  1,  2003,  as  it  applies  to  the  time  limitations  on  facsimile  advertisements.  The  Federal  Communications  Commission  will  publish  a  document  in  the  Federal 


 Register  when  the  stay  is  lifted. 
 *  *  *  *  * 
 5.  Section  64.1200  is  revised  to  read  as  follows: 
 §  64.1200  Delivery  restrictions. 
 (a)  *  *  * 
 (1)  *  *  * 
 (2)  *  *  * 
 (3)  Use  a  telephone  facsimile  machine,  computer,  or  other  device  to  send  an  unsolicited  advertisement  to  a  telephone  facsimile  machine,  unless  – 


 (i)  the  unsolicited  advertisement  is  from  a  sender  with  an  established  business  relationship,  as  defined  in  paragraph  (f)(  5)  of  this  section,  with  the  recipient;  and 
 (ii)  the  sender  obtained  the  number  of  the  telephone  facsimile  machine  through  – 
 (A)  the  voluntary  communication  of  such  number  by  the  recipient  directly  to  the  sender, 
33
 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  06-  42 
 34 
 within  the  context  of  such  established  business  relationship;  or 
 (B)  a  directory,  advertisement,  or  site  on  the  Internet  to  which  the  recipient  voluntarily  agreed  to  make  available  its  facsimile  number  for  public  distribution.  If  a  sender  obtains  the 


 facsimile  number  from  the  recipient’s  own  directory,  advertisement,  or  internet  site,  it  will  be  presumed  that  the  number  was  voluntarily  made  available  for  public  distribution, 
 unless  such  materials  explicitly  note  that  unsolicited  advertisements  are  not  accepted  at  the  specified  facsimile  number.  If  a  sender  obtains  the  facsimile  number  from  other 
 sources,  the  sender  must  take  reasonable  steps  to  verify  that  the  recipient  agreed  to  make  the  number  available  for  public  distribution. 


 (C)  This  clause  shall  not  apply  in  the  case  of  an  unsolicited  advertisement  that  is  sent  based  on  an  established  business  relationship  with  the  recipient  that  was  in  existence  before 
 July  9,  2005  if  the  sender  also  possessed  the  facsimile  machine  number  of  the  recipient  before  July  9,  2005.  There  shall  be  a  rebuttable  presumption  that  if  a  valid  established 
 business  relationship  was  formed  prior  to  July  9,  2005,  the  sender  possessed  the  facsimile  number  prior  to  such  date  as  well;  and 


 (iii)  the  advertisement  contains  a  notice  that  informs  the  recipient  of  the  ability  and  means  to  avoid  future  unsolicited  advertisements.  A  notice  contained  in  an  advertisement  complies  with  the  requirements 
 under  this  subparagraph  only  if  – 
 (A)  the  notice  is  clear  and  conspicuous  and  on  the  first  page  of  the  advertisement; 
 (B)  the  notice  states  that  the  recipient  may  make  a  request  to  the  sender  of  the  advertisement  not  to  send  any  future  advertisements  to  a  telephone  facsimile 


 machine  or  machines  and  that  failure  to  comply,  within  30  days,  with  such  a  request  meeting  the  requirements  under  subparagraph  (v)  is  unlawful; 


 (C)  the  notice  sets  forth  the  requirements  for  an  opt-  out  request  under  subparagraph  (v); 
 (D)  the  notice  includes— 
 (I)  a  domestic  contact  telephone  number  and  facsimile  machine  number  for  the  recipient  to  transmit  such  a  request  to  the  sender;  and 


 (II)  if  neither  the  required  telephone  number  or  facsimile  machine  number  is  a  toll-  free  number,  a  separate  cost-  free  mechanism  including  a  website 
 address  or  email  address,  for  a  recipient  to  transmit  a  request  pursuant  to  such  notice  to  the  sender  of  the  advertisement.  A  local  telephone  number 
 also  shall  constitute  a  cost-  free  mechanism  so  long  as  recipients  are  local  and  will  not  incur  any  long  distance  or  other  separate  charges  for  calls 
 made  to  such  number;  and 
 (E)  the  telephone  and  facsimile  numbers  and  cost-  free  mechanism  identified  in  the  notice  must  permit  an  individual  or  business  to  make  an  opt-  out  request  24  hours  a 


 day,  7  days  a  week. 
 (iv)  A  facsimile  advertisement  that  is  sent  to  a  recipient  that  has  provided  prior  express  invitation  or  permission  to  the  sender  must  include  an  opt-  out  notice  that  complies  with  the  requirements  in 
34
 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  06-  42

 subparagraph  (iii). 
 (v)  A  request  not  to  send  future  unsolicited  advertisements  to  a  telephone  facsimile  machine  complies  with  the  requirements  under  this  subparagraph  only  if  – 


 (A)  the  request  identifies  the  telephone  number  or  numbers  of  the  telephone  facsimile  machine  or  machines  to  which  the  request  relates; 
 (B)  the  request  is  made  to  the  telephone  number,  facsimile  number,  website  address  or  email  address  identified  in  the  sender’s  facsimile  advertisement;  and 
 (C)  the  person  making  the  request  has  not,  subsequent  to  such  request,  provided  express  invitation  or  permission  to  the  sender,  in  writing  or  otherwise,  to  send  such 
 advertisements  to  such  person  at  such  telephone  facsimile  machine. 
 (vi)  A  sender  that  receives  a  request  not  to  send  future  unsolicited  advertisements  that  complies  with  subparagraph  (v)  must  honor  that  request  within  the  shortest  reasonable  time  from  the  date  of  such 


 request,  not  to  exceed  30  days,  and  is  prohibited  from  sending  unsolicited  advertisements  to  the  recipient  unless  the  recipient  subsequently  provides  prior  express  invitation  or  permission  to  the 
 sender.  The  recipient’s  opt-  out  request  terminates  the  established  business  relationship  exemption  for  purposes  of  sending  future  unsolicited  advertisements.  If  such  requests  are  recorded  or  maintained  by 
 a  party  other  than  the  sender  on  whose  behalf  the  unsolicited  advertisement  is  sent,  the  sender  will  be  liable  for  any  failures  to  honor  the  opt-  out  request. 


 (vii)  A  facsimile  broadcaster  will  be  liable  for  violations  of  paragraph  (a)(  3)  of  this  section,  including  the  inclusion  of  opt-  out  notices  on  unsolicited  advertisements,  if  it  demonstrates  a  high  degree  of 
 involvement  in,  or  actual  notice  of,  the  unlawful  activity  and  fails  to  take  steps  to  prevent  such  facsimile  transmissions.

 (f)  *  *  * 
 (1)  *  *  * 
 (2)  The  term  clear  and  conspicuous  for  purposes  of  subparagraph  (a)(  3)(  iii)(  A)  means  a  notice  that  would  be  apparent  to  the  reasonable  consumer,  separate  and  distinguishable  from  the  advertising  copy  or  other 


 disclosures,  and  placed  at  either  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  facsimile. 
 (3)  The  term  emergency  purposes  means  calls  made  necessary  in  any  situation  affecting  the  health  and  safety  of  consumers. 


 (4)  The  term  established  business  relationship  for  purposes  of  telephone  solicitations  means  a  prior  or  existing  relationship  formed  by  a  voluntary  two-  way  communication  between  a  person  or  entity  and  a 
 residential  subscriber  with  or  without  an  exchange  of  consideration,  on  the  basis  of  the  subscriber’s  purchase  or  transaction  with  the  entity  within  the  eighteen  (18)  months  immediately  preceding  the  date  of 
 the  telephone  call  or  on  the  basis  of  the  subscriber’s  inquiry  or  application  regarding  products  or  services  offered  by  the  entity  within  the  three  months  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the  call,  which 
 relationship  has  not  been  previously  terminated  by  either  party.

 Appendix  B 
 Final  Regulatory  Flexibility  Analysis 
 68.  As  required  by  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act  of  1980,  as  amended  (RFA),  199  an  Initial  Regulatory  Flexibility  Analysis  (IRFA)  was  incorporated  in  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  and 


 Order  (JFPA  NPRM).  200  The  Commission  sought  written  public  comment  on  the  proposals  in  the  JFPA  NPRM,  including  comment  on  the  IRFA.  The  only  comment  received  on  the  IRFA  was  from  the  Office 
 of  Advocacy,  U.  S.  Small  Business  Administration,  and  is  discussed  below.  This  present  Final  Regulatory  Flexibility  Analysis  (FRFA)  conforms  to  the  RFA.  201 


 A.  Need  for,  and  Objectives  of,  the  Report  and  Order  and  Third  Order  on  Reconsideration 
 69.  This  Report  and  Order  and  Third  Order  on  Reconsideration  (Order)  is  necessary  to  comply  with  Congress’  mandate  for  the  Commission  to  issue  regulations  implementing  the  Junk  Fax 


 Prevention  Act  of  2005.  202  In  this  Order,  and  as  set  forth  in  the  statute,  we  (1)  codify  an  established  business  relationship  (EBR)  exemption  to  the  prohibition  on  sending  unsolicited  facsimile 
 advertisements;  (2)  provide  a  definition  of  an  EBR  to  be  used  in  the  context  of  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  that  is  not  limited  in  duration;  (3)  require  the  sender  of  a  facsimile  advertisement  to 
 provide  specified  notice  and  contact  information  on  the  facsimile  that  allows  recipients  to  “opt-  out”  of  any  future  facsimile  transmissions  from  the  sender;  and  (4)  specify  the  circumstances  under  which  a 
 request  to  “opt-  out”  complies  with  the  Act. 
 70.  Specifically,  in  accordance  with  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  the  Order  permits  the  sending  of  facsimile  advertisements  to  recipients  with  whom  the  sender  has  an  EBR,  provided  certain 


 conditions  are  met  regarding  how  the  facsimile  number  was  obtained.  203  In  addition,  the  definition  of  EBR  for  purposes  of  sending  facsimile  advertisements  extends  the  EBR  exemption  to  faxes  sent  to  both 
 businesses  and  residential  subscribers  and  is  not  limited  in  duration.  204  Under  the  new  rules,  senders  of  facsimile  advertisements  must  include  a  notice  describing  the  procedures  for  opting  out  of  future  faxes 
 that  is  clear  and  conspicuous  and  located  on  the  first  page  of  the  advertisement.  205  The  rules  require  that  an  opt-  out  notice  include  a  cost-  free  mechanism  for  the  recipient  to  request  not  to  receive  future  faxes. 
 The  cost-  free  mechanism  must  include  a  toll-  free  telephone  number,  toll-  free  facsimile  number,  website  address,  or  email  address.  If  the  recipient  makes  a  request  not  to  receive  future  fax  advertisements,  the 


 199  See  5  U.  S.  C.  §  603.  The  RFA,  see  5  U.  S.  C.  §§  601  –  612,  has  been  amended  by  the  Small  Business 
 Regulatory  Enforcement  Fairness  Act  of  1996  (SBREFA),  Pub.  L.  No.  104-  121,  Title  II,  110  Stat.  857  (1996).

 sender  must  honor  that  request  within  the  shortest  reasonable  time,  not  to  exceed  30  days.  206 
 71.  In  addition,  the  Order  declines  to  exempt  small  businesses  from  the  cost-  free  mechanism  requirement,  in  part  because  the  Commission  is  not  requiring  senders  to  provide  toll-  free  telephone 


 numbers  for  recipients  to  make  opt-  out  requests.  207  Finally,  the  Order  does  not  carve  out  an  exemption  for  tax-  exempt  nonprofit  professional  or  trade  associations  from  the  opt-  out  notice  requirement,  noting 
 that  the  benefits  to  consumers  of  having  opt-  out  information  readily  available  outweigh  the  burden  in  including  such  notices.  208 


 72.  Finally,  the  Order  addresses  certain  issues  raised  in  petitions  for  reconsideration  of  the  2003  TCPA  Order  209  concerning  the  TCPA’s  facsimile  advertising  rules.  Specifically,  the  Order  provides 
 guidance  to  fax  senders  on  what  messages  do  not  constitute  unsolicited  advertisements  for  purposes  of  the  fax  rules  and  therefore  could  be  sent  without  the  prior  permission  of  the  recipient.  The  Order  clarifies 
 that  messages  that  do  not  promote  a  commercial  product  or  service,  including  all  messages  involving  political  or  religious  discourse,  such  as  a  request  for  a  donation  to  a  political  campaign,  political  action 
 committee  or  charitable  organization,  are  not  unsolicited  advertisements  under  the  TCPA.  210  The  Order  also  concludes  that  messages  whose  purpose  is  to  facilitate,  complete,  or  confirm  a  commercial 
 transaction  that  the  recipient  has  previously  agreed  to  enter  into  with  the  sender  are  not  advertisements.  These  might  include  a  receipt  or  invoice,  the  primary  purpose  of  which  is  to  confirm  the  purchase  of 
 certain  items  by  the  facsimile  recipient,  an  account  statement,  or  communications  sent  to  facilitate  a  loan  transaction  already  entered  into  by  the  recipient.  211  In  addition,  the  Order  determines  that  facsimile 
 communications  that  contain  only  information,  such  as  industry  news  articles,  legislative  updates,  or  employee  benefit  information,  would  not  be  prohibited  by  the  TCPA  rules.  212  An  incidental 
 advertisement  contained  in  such  a  facsimile  does  not  convert  the  entire  communication  into  an  advertisement. 


 B.  Summary  of  Significant  Issues  Raised  by  Public  Comments  in  Response  to  the  Supplemental  IRFA 
 73.  The  only  comment  filed  directly  in  response  to  the  IRFA  was  from  the  Office  of  Advocacy  of  the  U.  S.  Small  Business  Administration  (Advocacy). 
 74.  In  its  comments,  Advocacy  identified  five  proposed  rules  that  would  impact  small  businesses.  First,  Advocacy  noted  the  Commission’s  proposal  to  limit  the  duration  of  the  EBR  as  it

 212  See  id.,  supra,  para.  53.

 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  06-  42 
 40 
 applies  to  unsolicited  fax  advertisements.  213  Advocacy  contends  that,  as  required  by  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  the  proposed  rule  does  not  include  an  analysis  or  determination  that  the  EBR  has  resulted 
 in  a  significant  number  of  complaints.  214  Advocacy  does  not  believe  that  the  FCC  has  gathered  the  necessary  information  about  complaints  to  limit  the  EBR.  In  addition,  Advocacy  contends  that  for  small 
 businesses  to  keep  track  of  inquiries  by  customers  would  require  a  considerable  increase  in  the  amount  of  record-  keeping  and  would  impede  the  ability  of  small  businesses  to  respond  to  such  inquiries.  215 


 75.  Second,  the  Commission  asked  whether  it  was  necessary  to  set  forth  rules  on  what  is  to  be  considered  “clear  and  conspicuous”  for  purposes  of  an  opt-  out  notice  on  a  fax  advertisement.  216 
 Advocacy  believes  that  the  clear  and  conspicuous  requirement  should  be  held  to  a  reasonable  standard  and  that  “any  further  attempts  by  the  FCC  to  define  the  notice  requirement  would  likely  become  mired  in 
 minutia  and  would  likely  cause  more  confusion  than  guidance.”  217 
 76.  Third,  Advocacy  believes  that  30  days  to  comply  with  a  do-  not-  fax  request  is  reasonable.  218  Fourth,  Advocacy  recommends  that  the  Commission  exempt  small  businesses  from  the 


 cost-  free  mechanism  requirement  in  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act.  219  Advocacy  contends  that  many  small  businesses  (particularly  very  small  businesses)  do  not  have  toll-  free  numbers.  If  the  Commission 
 determines  not  to  exempt  small  businesses,  Advocacy  recommends  that  the  FCC  allow  them  to  use  alternatives  to  toll-  free  numbers  because  of  the  “great  expense  associated  with  maintaining  toll-  free 
 numbers.”  220  They  state  that  small  businesses  recommend  e-  mail,  web-  based  systems,  or  the  designation  of  a  third  party  as  viable  alternatives.  Advocacy  also  says  that  small  businesses  believe  that  once  a  small 
 business  has  chosen  a  means  of  receiving  do-  not-  fax  requests,  then  opt-  out  requests  should  only  be  enforceable  if  they  are  received  in  that  manner.  221  Finally,  Advocacy  indicates  that  small  businesses 
 believe  an  exemption  for  tax-  exempt  nonprofit  associations  from  the  opt-  out  notice  requirement  would  be  appropriate.  222 


 C.  Description  and  Estimate  of  the  Number  of  Small  Entities  To  Which  Rules  Will  Apply 
 77.  The  RFA  directs  agencies  to  provide  a  description  of,  and,  where  feasible,  an  estimate  of,

 the  number  of  small  entities  that  may  be  affected  by  the  rules  adopted  herein.  223  The  RFA  generally  defines  the  term  “small  entity”  as  having  the  same  meaning  as  the  terms  “small  business,”  “small 
 organization,”  and  “small  governmental  jurisdiction.”  224  In  addition,  the  term  “small  business”  has  the  same  meaning  as  the  term  “small  business  concern”  under  the  Small  Business  Act.  225  A  “small  business 
 concern”  is  one  which:  (1)  is  independently  owned  and  operated;  (2)  is  not  dominant  in  its  field  of  operation;  and  (3)  satisfies  any  additional  criteria  established  by  the  Small  Business  Administration 
 (SBA).  226 
 78.  A  small  organization  is  generally  “any  not-  for-  profit  enterprise  which  is  independently  owned  and  operated  and  is  not  dominant  in  its  field.”  227  Nationwide,  as  of  2002,  there  were 


 approximately  1.6  million  small  organizations.  228  The  term  "small  governmental  jurisdiction"  is  defined  as  “governments  of  cities,  towns,  townships,  villages,  school  districts,  or  special  districts,  with  a 
 population  of  less  than  fifty  thousand.”  229  As  of  1997,  there  were  approximately  87,453  governmental  jurisdictions  in  the  United  States.  230  This  number  includes  39,044  county  governments,  municipalities, 
 and  townships,  of  which  37,546  (approximately  96.2%)  have  populations  of  fewer  than  50,000,  and  of  which  1,498  have  populations  of  50,000  or  more.  Thus,  we  estimate  the  number  of  small  governmental 
 jurisdictions  overall  to  be  84,098  or  fewer.  Nationwide,  there  are  a  total  of  approximately  22.4  million  small  businesses,  according  to  SBA  data.  231 


 79.  A  more  precise  estimate  of  small  businesses  affected  might  be  made.  The  IFRA  stated  that  the  Commission’s  rules  on  the  sending  of  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  would  apply  to  any 
 entity,  including  any  telecommunications  carrier,  that  uses  the  telephone  facsimile  machine  to  advertise.  232  Advocacy  agreed,  stating  that  “since  what  can  be  considered  a  commercial  fax  is  so  broad,  it 
 is  appropriate  for  the  FCC  to  consider  that  its  rule  could  potentially  impact  almost  all  small  businesses.”  233  Advocacy  also  noted  that  the  U.  S.  Census  Bureau  updated  its  estimates  based  upon 


 223  5  U.  S.  C.  §  604(  a)(  3). 
 224  5  U.  S.  C.  §  601(  6). 
 225  5  U.  S.  C.  §  601(  3)  (incorporating  by  reference  the  definition  of  “small-  business  concern”  in  the  Small  Business 
 Act,  15  U.  S.  C.  §  632).  Pursuant  to  5  U.  S.  C.  §  601(  3),  the  statutory  definition  of  a  small  business  applies  “unless  an  agency,  after  consultation  with  the  Office  of  Advocacy  of  the  Small  Business  Administration  and  after 


 opportunity  for  public  comment,  establishes  one  or  more  definitions  of  such  term  which  are  appropriate  to  the  activities  of  the  agency  and  publishes  such  definition(  s)  in  the  Federal  Register.”

 census  information  from  2002,  which  places  the  total  number  of  small  businesses  in  the  United  States  (which  it  defines  as  firms  with  fewer  than  500  employees)  at  5.68  million.  234  Advocacy  explains  that 
 ordinarily  the  SBA  defines  small  business  on  an  industry-  by-  industry  basis.  However,  Advocacy  contends  that  this  is  not  practicable  for  the  proposed  rules  because  of  its  “broad  applicability  across 
 industry  lines  which  would  create  confusion  on  the  part  of  small  businesses”  as  to  whether  or  not  they  are  covered  by  the  rules.  Accordingly,  Advocacy  recommends  the  Commission  consider  adopting  a  new 
 small  business  size  standard  for  this  rule.  235  Drawing  from  the  input  from  small  business  groups,  Advocacy  recommends  that  the  FCC  adopt  a  size  standard  of  100  employees  for  this  rulemaking.  Based 
 on  the  U.  S.  Census  2002  numbers,  Advocacy  indicates  that  5.6  million  firms  would  then  qualify  as  small  businesses.  236  Given  that  we  are  not  exempting  small  businesses  from  the  requirement  to  identify  a  cost-free 
 mechanism  for  fax  recipients  to  opt-  out  of  future  unwanted  faxes,  we  conclude  it  is  not  necessary  at  this  time  to  adopt  a  new  small  business  size  standard  for  this  rule.  Therefore,  we  estimate  that,  consistent 
 with  Advocacy’s  comments,  the  rules  apply  to  5.68  million  small  entities  across  all  industries  in  the  United  States. 


 D.  Description  of  Projected  Reporting,  Record  Keeping,  and  Other  Compliance  Requirements 
 80.  The  Order  will  likely  result  in  increases  in  projected  reporting,  record  keeping,  and  other  compliance  requirements  for  senders  of  facsimile  advertisements.  The  statutory  and  rule  changes  affect 


 both  small  and  large  companies.  First,  in  accordance  with  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  the  Order  adopts  an  EBR  exemption  for  sending  fax  advertisements.  Should  a  question  arise  as  to  the  validity  of  an  EBR, 
 the  burden  will  be  on  the  sender  to  show  that  it  has  a  valid  EBR  with  the  recipient.  However,  the  Commission  emphasized  that  there  is  no  requirement  that  senders  of  fax  advertisements  maintain  any 
 specific  records  demonstrating  that  an  EBR  exists.  We  believe  the  EBR  can  be  demonstrated  with  records  kept  in  the  usual  course  of  business,  such  as  purchase  agreements,  sales  slips,  applications  and  inquiry 
 records.  237 
 81.  In  accordance  with  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act,  the  Commission  concluded  that  an  EBR  alone  does  not  entitle  a  sender  to  fax  an  advertisement  to  an  individual  consumer  or  business.  The  sender 


 must  also  ensure  that  the  telephone  facsimile  number  was  provided  voluntarily  by  the  recipient.  We  find  that  it  would  be  permissible  for  the  sender  to  fax  an  advertisement  to  a  recipient  that  had  provided  a 
 facsimile  number  directly  to  the  sender,  for  example,  on  an  application,  information  request,  contact  information  form,  or  membership  renewal  form.  238  In  the  event  a  recipient  complains  that  its  facsimile 
 number  was  not  provided  to  the  sender,  the  burden  rests  with  the  sender  to  demonstrate,  with  such  business  records,  that  the  number  was  communicated  in  the  context  of  the  EBR.  Similarly,  if  the 
 facsimile  number  was  obtained  from  the  recipient’s  own  directory,  advertisement,  or  internet  site,  the  Commission  determined  that  it  was  voluntarily  made  available  for  public  distribution,  unless  the  recipient 
 has  noted  on  such  materials  that  it  does  not  accept  unsolicited  advertisements  at  the  facsimile  number  in

 question.  In  such  circumstances,  the  facsimile  recipient’s  own  advertisement  would  serve  as  evidence  of  the  recipient’s  agreement  to  make  the  number  available  for  public  distribution.  239  If  the  sender  obtains  the 
 number  from  sources  of  information  compiled  by  third  parties,  the  sender  must  take  reasonable  steps  to  verify  that  the  recipient  consented  to  have  the  number  listed,  such  as  calling  or  emailing  the  recipient. 
 While  the  Commission  is  not  requiring  that  any  specific  records  be  kept,  should  a  question  arise  about  how  the  facsimile  number  was  obtained,  the  sender  would  need  to  demonstrate  that  it  was  voluntarily 
 provided.  240  It  is  up  to  senders  to  determine  the  best  way  to  do  so  if  that  becomes  necessary. 
 82.  The  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  facsimile  senders  to  include  a  notice  on  the  first  page  of  the  unsolicited  advertisement  that  instructs  the  recipient  how  to  request  that  they  not  receive 


 future  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  from  the  sender.  In  the  Order,  we  require  that  all  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements  contain  a  notice  on  the  first  page  of  the  advertisement  stating  that  the  recipient  is 
 entitled  to  request  that  the  sender  not  send  any  future  unsolicited  advertisements.  241  The  notice  must  be  separate  from  the  advertising  copy  or  other  disclosures  and  placed  at  either  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  fax. 
 The  notice  also  must  include  a  domestic  contact  telephone  number  and  a  facsimile  machine  number,  and  at  least  one  cost-  free  mechanism  for  transmitting  an  opt-  out  request.  In  the  Order,  the  Commission 
 concluded  that  a  website  address,  email  address,  toll-  free  telephone  number,  or  toll-  free  facsimile  machine  number  will  constitute  “cost-  free  mechanisms”  for  purposes  of  the  rules.  For  those  facsimile 
 senders  that  do  not  already  have  one  of  these  mechanisms  in  place,  they  will  need  to  implement  one  in  order  to  give  recipients  a  cost-  free  way  of  opting-  out  of  faxes.  In  accordance  with  the  statute,  the 
 mechanism  must  accept  opt-  out  requests  24  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week  at  the  mechanisms  identified  in  the  notice.  242  The  rules  also  require  that  highly  involved  fax  broadcasters  must  ensure  that  the  faxes  it 
 transmits  on  behalf  of  each  sender  contain  the  necessary  information  to  allow  a  consumer  to  opt-  out  of  a  particular  sender’s  faxes  in  the  future.  243 


 83.  The  new  rules  require  that  a  facsimile  sender  that  receives  a  request  not  to  send  future  unsolicited  advertisements  that  complies  with  the  rules  must  honor  that  request  within  the  shortest 
 reasonable  time  from  the  date  of  such  request,  not  to  exceed  30  days  from  the  date  of  such  request  and  is  prohibited  from  sending  unsolicited  advertisements  to  the  recipient  unless  the  recipient  subsequently 
 provides  prior  express  invitation  or  permission  to  the  sender.  244  Facsimile  senders  will  need  to  take  steps  to  remove  such  facsimile  numbers  from  their  faxing  databases,  or  maintain  do-  not-  fax  lists  to  avoid 
 sending  advertisements  to  recipients  that  have  opted  out,  within  the  shortest  reasonable  time,  not  to  exceed  30  days.  If  a  recipient  subsequently  provides  the  sender  with  his  express  permission  to  send 
 advertisements,  whether  orally  or  in  writing,  the  burden  of  proof  rests  with  the  sender  to  demonstrate  that  permission  was  given.  Thus,  we  suggest  that  senders  take  steps  to  promptly  document  that  they  received 
 such  permission  by,  for  instance,  recording  the  oral  authorization,  or  using  established  business  practices

 E.  Steps  Taken  to  Minimize  Significant  Economic  Impact  on  Small  Entities  and  Significant  Alternatives  Considered 


 84.  The  RFA  requires  an  agency  to  describe  any  significant  alternatives  that  it  has  considered  in  reaching  its  proposed  approach,  which  may  include  the  following  four  alternatives  (among  others):  (1) 
 the  establishment  of  differing  compliance  or  reporting  requirements  or  timetables  that  take  into  account  the  resources  available  to  small  entities;  (2)  the  clarification,  consolidation,  or  simplification  of 
 compliance  or  reporting  requirements  under  the  rule  for  small  entities;  (3)  the  use  of  performance,  rather  than  design,  standards;  and  (4)  an  exemption  from  coverage  of  the  rule,  or  any  part  thereof,  for  small 
 entities.  246 
 85.  In  this  Order,  we  adopt  rules  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  in  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act.  In  doing  so,  we  consider  a  number  of  alternatives  to  minimize  the  economic  impact  on 


 small  entities  that  must  comply  with  the  rules.  In  this  Order,  the  Commission  adopts  an  EBR  exemption  to  the  prohibition  on  sending  unsolicited  facsimile  advertisements.  The  exemption  will  permit  all  entities, 
 including  small  businesses,  to  send  fax  advertisements  to  their  EBR  customers  without  having  to  secure  written  permission  from  them  first.  In  addition,  the  Commission  was  authorized  by  Congress  to  consider 
 limiting  the  duration  of  the  EBR.  In  the  Order,  the  Commission  determined  not  to  limit  the  EBR  and  alternatively  indicated  it  would  closely  monitor  implementation  of  the  new  EBR  exemption  and  opt-  out 
 policies  adopted  in  the  Order.  247  As  part  of  its  review,  the  Commission  will  evaluate  the  Commission’s  complaint  data  to  determine  whether  the  EBR  exception  has  resulted  in  a  significant  number  of 
 complaints  regarding  facsimile  advertisements  and  whether  such  complaints  involve  fax  advertisements  sent  based  on  an  EBR  of  a  duration  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  reasonable  expectations  of  consumers.  248 


 86.  In  addition,  the  Junk  Fax  Prevention  Act  requires  facsimile  senders  to  include  a  clear  and  conspicuous  notice  on  the  first  page  of  the  unsolicited  advertisement  that  instructs  the  recipient  how  to 
 opt-  out  of  future  unwanted  faxes.  As  discussed  in  the  Order,  the  Commission  considered  defining  clear  and  conspicuous  to  mean  a  notice  that  is  on  the  first  page  of  the  advertisement  and  apparent  to  a 
 reasonable  consumer.  249  Alternatively,  we  considered  providing  additional  guidance  to  ensure  that  consumers  are  aware  of  their  opt-  out  rights  and  sending  parties  have  standards  by  which  they  can  comply 
 with  the  law.  250  In  the  Order,  the  Commission  determined  that  “clear  and  conspicuous”  for  purposes  of  the  opt-  out  notice  means  a  notice  that  would  be  apparent  to  a  reasonable  consumer  and  located  on  the  first 
 page  of  the  fax  advertisement.  We  further  clarified  that  the  notice  must  be  separate  from  the  advertising  copy  or  other  disclosures  and  placed  at  either  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  fax.  251  However,  we  declined  to

 adopt  rules  specifying  the  font  type,  size  and  wording  of  the  notice. 
 87.  The  statute  also  requires  that  senders  identify  in  their  notices  a  cost-  free  mechanism  for  recipients  to  transmit  opt-  out  requests  to  the  senders.  Rather  than  require  senders  to  provide  a  toll-  free 


 telephone  number  for  consumers  to  request  that  no  future  faxes  be  sent,  the  Commission  chose  an  alternative  approach  that  permits  senders  to  use  a  website  address,  email  address,  toll-  free  telephone 
 number,  or  toll-  free  facsimile  number.  252  Allowing  senders  to  use  websites  and  email  addresses  should  minimize  any  burdens  on  them,  particularly  small  businesses  for  whom  setting  up  a  toll-  free  number 
 might  be  costly.  The  Commission  also  determined  that  recipients  must  use  the  opt-  out  mechanisms  identified  by  the  senders  in  their  notices  so  that  such  businesses,  including  small  businesses,  can  more 
 easily  account  for  all  opt-  out  requests  and  process  them  in  a  timely  manner.  253 
 88.  In  the  JFPA  NPRM,  the  Commission  sought  comment  on  whether  to  exempt  small  businesses  from  the  requirement  to  provide  a  cost-  free  mechanism  for  a  recipient  to  transmit  an  opt-  out 


 request.  254  As  noted  above,  the  Commission  declined  to  require  fax  senders  to  offer  a  toll-  free  number  for  recipients  to  request  that  no  future  faxes  be  sent.  Given  that  we  are  not  mandating  the  use  of  toll-  free 
 numbers,  as  well  as  the  support  in  the  record  for  using  websites  and  email  addresses  by  small  businesses,  the  Commission  determined  not  to  exempt  small  businesses  from  the  cost-  free  mechanism  requirement.  255 
 The  Commission  found  that  the  record  contained  little  empirical  evidence  that  the  costs  associated  with  setting  up  a  website  or  email  address  would  be  unduly  burdensome  to  a  small  business  given  its 
 revenues.  256 
 89.  The  Commission  also  considered  the  burdens  to  businesses  of  having  to  comply  with  opt-out  requests  in  the  “shortest  reasonable  time.”  The  record  revealed  that  some  commenters  support  a 


 period  of  30  days  within  which  senders  must  comply  with  opt-  out  requests.  Other  commenters  support  a  shorter  period  of  time  for  honoring  do-  not-  fax  requests,  such  as  10  or  15  days.  257  In  the  Order,  the 
 Commission  determined  to  require  senders  to  honor  requests  within  the  shortest  reasonable  time  from  the  date  of  such  request,  not  to  exceed  30  days.  258  We  believe  this  will  permit  both  senders  with  large 
 databases  of  facsimile  numbers,  as  well  as  small  businesses  with  limited  resources,  to  remove  numbers  for  individuals  that  opt-  out  of  faxes. 


 90.  Finally,  the  Order  removes  the  Commission’s  rule  at  section  64.1200(  a)(  3)(  i)  which  requires  the  sender  to  obtain  a  signed,  written  statement  indicating  the  recipient’s  consent  to  receive 
 facsimile  advertisements.  259  The  Commission  determined  instead  that  prior  express  invitation  or

 permission  to  send  an  advertisement  may  be  given  by  oral  or  written  means,  including  electronic  methods.  We  noted  that  written  permission  could  take  many  forms,  including  email,  facsimile,  and 
 internet  form.  We  believe  this  determination  will  permit  small  entities  to  obtain  permission  more  easily  from  consumers  who  make  inquiries,  file  applications,  or  request  information. 


 F.  Report  to  Congress 
 91.  The  Commission  will  send  a  copy  of  the  Order,  including  this  FRFA,  in  a  report  to  be  sent  to  Congress  and  the  Government  Accountability  Office  pursuant  to  the  SBREFA.  260  In  addition,  the 


 Commission  will  send  a  copy  of  the  Order,  including  the  FRFA,  to  the  Chief  Counsel  for  Advocacy  of  the  SBA.  A  copy  of  the  Order  and  the  FRFA  (or  summaries  thereof)  will  also  be  published  in  the  Federal 
 Register.  261
