	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">A. Purpose of Project</H3> 
	 <P>In 1981, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was first identified
		in adults, and a few years later it was identified in children. AIDS, and AIDS
		virus infection (or HIV infection), as a fatal disease of epidemic proportions
		in children, is quickly emerging as a major public health tragedy that places
		extreme demands on the already overburdened health and social service system of
		this country. The issues surrounding the care and treatment of children with
		AIDS, and their ramifications upon the health and social service systems are
		not yet fully known or understood.</P> 
	 <P>Surveillance data that CDC has gathered show that as of December 31,
		1987 there were a total of 737 cases of AIDS in children (CDC Surveillance
		Report, 1987). CDC estimates 3,000 cases of pediatric AIDS by 1991, and there
		are estimates that 10,000 - 20,000 infants and children will be infected with
		HIV by 1991 (Report of the Surgeon General's workshop). The vast majority (73
		percent) of children who acquired AIDS come from families where one or both
		parents are intravenous (IV) drug abusers (Report of the Surgeon General's
		workshop). Most of the reported cases in the U.S. (58 percent) have been in New
		York City, New York; Newark, New Jersey; and Miami, Florida; three cities with
		large drug abusing populations (CDC Surveillance report, December 28,
		1987).</P> 
	 <P>Legal, social and medical issues associated with the problem have
		attracted the attention of the media, Congress and local and federal policy
		makers, all of whom are grappling with the services needed by these children,
		the depth and quality of services currently delivered, and the present and
		future financial burden and sources of funds. Since the problem is relatively
		new, there are few studies and inadequate data to support, test, or verify
		approaches or hypotheses aimed at alleviating the problem.</P> 
	 <P>There have been reports of AIDS babies abandoned in hospitals and
		shortages of foster care placements for these children. It is also generally
		believed that medical and other costs of caring for these children are higher
		than for children with other special conditions.</P> 
	 <P>In light of these and other growing problems and the lack of sufficient
		information, The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation
		(ASPE), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), commissioned Macro
		Systems, Inc., to conduct a brief, exploratory study to obtain an initial
		understanding of the prevailing issues. This study will provide suggestions for
		further lines of inquiry into specific problems and issues.</P> 
	 <P>This study is timely in nature because issues concerned with pediatric
		AIDS are constantly emerging and evolving. Much can be learned from the early
		experiences in the three cities toward shaping future planning and effective
		responses for the nation. DHHS is taking a cross-cutting perspective of issues
		because service delivery to these children involves the linkage of several
		health and social service sectors of the overall service system. This study
		will enable DHHS to identify the issues that need further exploration in order
		to determine an efficacious and timely Federal response to this critical public
		health issue.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">B. Scope of the Project</H3> 
	 <P>The goals of the study are to: define the issues related to providing
		care to children with AIDS; place parameters around the size and scope of the
		problem; and attempt to clarify some of the perceptions and approaches relevant
		to the problem. This project focuses on children with AIDS whose parents are,
		or have had sexual contact with, IV drug abusers. Their social service needs
		differ from the needs of the hemophilia and other blood transfusion
		populations. The study's focus is more on child welfare service problems,
		issues and needs than on medical treatment issues. However, the medical care
		system is intricately involved in providing both medical and social services to
		these children and, therefore, is included in this focus.</P> 
	 <P>The specific objectives of the study are to:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>Summarize what is known about the natural history of HIV infected
			 children and the types of non-medical services appropriate for them.</P></LI> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>Define service and financing policy issues.</P></LI> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>Describe how the three cities with the highest incidence of HIV
			 infected children are presently coping with the care of these children in terms
			 of types of care and financing, issues that result, including problems and
			 successes, and what they consider to be the prospects for the future.</P></LI> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>Describe exemplary practices, i.e. specific activities and responses
			 that appear to work in each city.</P></LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>The number of pediatric AIDS cases continues to increase; knowledge
		about the medical aspects of the disease is still evolving; and responses to
		the problem are continuously formulated, tested and redefined. During the
		course of this study, a number of other studies and activities regarding
		children with AIDS were underway, or had recently been completed. Several of
		these are listed in <A HREF="#appendA">Appendix A</A>.</P> 
	 <P>Resources designated for the study were limited to the defined scope of
		the project and thus precluded in-depth exploration of any one issue. The
		observations presented in this report provide a snapshot of the rapidly moving
		and changing situation of AIDS in children as it effects three cities, and
		hopefully provide a glimpse into the future in terms of what to expect and how
		to formulate appropriate and effective responses.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">C. Methodology</H3> 
	 <P>The project methodology included four components: designing an analytic
		framework, reviewing the literature, conducting telephone discussions with
		people involved in AIDS policy issues, and conducting site visits to the three
		cities with the highest prevalence of children with AIDS.</P> 
	 <P>An analytic framework was created to outline a means of depicting
		information obtained about issues, barriers and responses. It provided a
		direction and focus to the project. A preliminary framework was designed at the
		onset of the study and then revised after the literature review and telephone
		discussions to help direct the site visits and shape the analysis. The revised
		analytic framework appears in <A HREF="#appendB">Appendix B</A>.</P> 
	 <P>The literature review included abstracts of papers presented at the
		Third International Conference On AIDS held in Washington, D.C., the report of
		the Surgeon General's Workshop in Philadelphia, and published papers in
		medical, public health and child welfare related journals. The literature
		review was not intended to be exhaustive, but to provide an overview of the
		salient cross-cutting issues. During the course of the project a number of new
		articles were published, and other unpublished reports were also brought to our
		attention. Time did not permit a written review of all of these materials;
		however, a bibliography of these resources is included in <A
		HREF="#appendC">Appendix C</A>, and summaries of the articles reviewed are
		included in <A HREF="#appendD">Appendix D</A>.</P> 
	 <P>The literature review provided the background information necessary to
		conduct telephone discussions with key persons knowledgeable about the issues
		and policy implications. Time and limited resources did not permit us to
		contact every individual or organization with expertise or involvement in
		pediatric AIDS. we did attempt to contact a variety of organizations to obtain
		a complete picture of the different perceptions of the issues. Persons
		contacted had affiliations with national social service, AIDS service and
		minority organizations, Federal agencies, and congressional offices. A total of
		21 organizations were contacted (<A HREF="#appendE">Appendix E</A>). Issues
		discussed included trends in the incidence and spread of the disease, degree of
		illness in children, level of care required, financing issues/approaches to the
		care of these children, and policy implications. Summaries of the telephone
		discussions appear in <A HREF="#appendF">Appendix F</A>. The site visit
		approach was based on the literature review and prior telephone
		discussions.</P> 
	 <P>Major issues and critical questions that were repeatedly mentioned in
		the literature and/or during the telephone discussions included:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>What is the extent of the "boarder baby" situation; are all boarder
			 babies also AIDS babies?</P></LI> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>How many AIDS, ARC and HIV positive children are there?</P></LI> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>A child with AIDS usually has a parent with AIDS. What are the
			 health and social service needs of these families?</P></LI> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>These children and their families experience problems and barriers
			 in obtaining needed health and social services. What are the barriers/problems
			 that are unique to AIDS and what are the barriers/problems that already existed
			 and are exacerbated by AIDS?</P></LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The analytic framework was revised accordingly, site visits were
		scheduled and discussion issues and questions were sent to the sites prior to
		the visit to familiarize them with the topics to be discussed (<A
		HREF="#appendG">Appendix G</A>). Persons contacted and visited included those
		involved in various aspects of the problem including child welfare officials,
		foster parents, voluntary organizations and other community groups, hospital
		personnel, public health officials, and State and local government officials. A
		list of persons contacted at each site is included in <A
		HREF="#appendH">Appendix H</A>, and summaries of each site visit are included
		in <A HREF="#appendI">Appendix I</A>.</P>

	 <H2><A NAME="chapII">II. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM</A></H2> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">A. Natural History of AIDS</H3> 
	 <P>AIDS is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Maternal
		transmission of HIV most often occurs perinatally; however, there is some
		evidence that it can also occur prenatally and postnatally (via breast milk)
		(Pyum, 1987). Infants can test positive for passively transferred maternal HIV
		antibody for up to 15 months of age without actually being infected
		(<B><I>MMWR</I></B>, April 24, 1987). It is estimated that as much as 65
		percent of infants born to infected mothers have HIV infection
		(<B><I>MMWR</I></B>, December 6, 1985).</P> 
	 <P>The CDC has implemented an AIDS case reporting definition for use in
		national surveillance. To qualify as a case, there must be evidence of a
		damaged immune system and the presence of an "officially recognized" cancer,
		opportunistic infection, dementia or wasting. The pediatric AIDS case
		definition differs from adults. In children, multiple or recurrent serious
		bacterial infections and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia/pulmonary lymphoid
		hyperplasia are accepted indicators of AIDS. The laboratory criteria for HIV
		infection in infants less than 15 months of age are more stringent because of
		the potential that the detectable AIDS antibodies were passively acquired.</P> 
	 <P>Clinical experience shows that children with documented HIV infection
		can also have symptoms of illness and yet not meet the strict CDC criteria for
		AIDS. On this account, the literature often refers to all HIV infected
		children, including those with AIDS, ARC and those who are HIV positive and
		symptomatic. Failure to thrive is a major feature of children with HIV
		infection. Downstate Medical Center in Now York City found that 80 percent of
		ARC/AIDS infants studied failed to thrive, and that 96 percent had neurological
		deficits. HIV infected children can also have a variety of other illnesses,
		including anemia, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, encephalopathy, recurrent
		bacterial infection, hepatitis and renal disease, to name a few.</P> 
	 <P>Early medical intervention for the HIV infected infant is important.
		This can include nutritional support, treatment of infection and therapy with
		intravenous gamma globulin. Hospitalization is often required, but increasingly
		care and treatment can be provided on an outpatient basis. The mortality rate
		is high, especially if opportunistic infection is acquired in the first year of
		life.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">B. Magnitude</H3> 
	 <P>As of December, 1987, CDC reported a total of 737 AIDS cases in children
		up to 13 years old (<A HREF="#exhibit1">Exhibit 1</A>). HIV infection in
		children is predominantly among blacks (54 percent), including children of
		parents coming from Haiti, and Hispanics (24 percent). In addition, HIV
		infection in children is also a problem closely linked to IV drug abuse.
		Nationally, 77 percent of the officially reported pediatric AIDS cases had a
		parent with or at risk for AIDS primarily through either IV drug abuse or
		sexual contact with an IV drug abuser.</P>

	 <P>Professionals who have been working closely with the problem feel that
		the magnitude is much larger than is currently known. For example, the New York
		City AIDS Surveillance Unit has estimated that there have been approximately
		500 ARC cases and 2,000 HIV infected children. An HIV seropositivity research
		study demonstrated that within one section of New York City two out of every
		100 women were HIV antibody seropositive. This finding was verified by a New
		York State seropositivity study of all births n the state for a one month
		period--very high risk areas were found to have approximately a 2.5 percent
		newborn seropositivity rate.</P> 
	 <P>Other areas are experiencing similar disparities between the number of
		officially reported pediatric AIDS cases and the number of children in need of
		clinical and social services. For example, Washington, D.C. officially reported
		14 cases of pediatric AIDS, but has a cumulative total of 116 HIV infected, ARC
		and AIDS children. In Georgia, 16 pediatric AIDS cases have been reported, but
		there have been approximately 56 HIV antibody positive, ARC and AIDS children.
		Since there is no consistent or widespread testing of newborns and/or pregnant
		women, estimates of the disparity between reported pediatric AIDS cases and the
		number of children managed in any given municipality cannot be determined
		precisely.</P>

	 </TABLE> 
	 <P>Projections for future numbers of cases in children and adolescents
		usually use the year 1991 as the target year. CDC estimates a cumulative total
		of 3,000 children with AIDS by that date. The New York City Health Department
		predicts that there will be 10,000 cumulative cases of AIDS, ARC and HIV
		positive children, and James Oleske, at Children's Hospital in Newark, New
		Jersey estimates 10,000 to 20,000 symptomatic HIV infected infants and children
		by 1991 (Report of the Surgeon General's Workshop). Although there are very few
		known cases of adolescents with ARC/AIDS at present, it can be reasonably
		predicted that they will begin to play a significant role in the future.
		Medical advances are extending the lives of children with AIDS, and children
		and young adolescents experiment with sexual activity and with drug use. In
		addition, the history of sexually transmitted disease control is that
		adolescents represent approximately 25 percent of those diseases, some of which
		are known precursors for subsequent HIV infection.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">C. Service Delivery Needs</H3> 
	 <P>Caring for an HIV infected child poses special challenges. There are the
		demands of taking care of an ill child, including frequent visits to the
		hospital, special infection control precautions, managing special health needs
		and recurrent medical crises, and perhaps ultimately coping with the child's
		death. Because of the widespread fear of AIDS, it is sometimes difficult to
		obtain needed services such as dental care, day care, schooling, etc., and
		frequently there is ostracism by family and friends if the child's HIV status
		is known.</P> 
	 <P>Most HIV infected children are from minority (black, Haitian and
		Hispanic) and impoverished families. It is not uncommon for the child to be the
		index case of AIDS in a family with other infected members. Often, one or both
		parents are or have been IV drug abusers and are themselves ill or dying with
		ARC or AIDS, and the child may have a sibling with AIDS.</P> 
	 <P>In addition to dealing with medical and social service needs, parents
		often must cope with the emotional trauma of their own or each other's illness
		or death, and the guilt of having passed the HIV infection to their child.
		These families are also in need of income support, housing assistance,
		transportation, in-home care and assistance in obtaining these benefits.
		Historically, the minority and IV drug abusing populations have had difficulty
		accessing the health and social service systems.</P> 
	 <P>For children whose parents are too ill to care for them, whose parents
		have died, or who have been abandoned by their parents, alternative
		guardianship arrangements are required. These arrangements have included
		extended families (most often a grandmother), foster families, and congregate
		care homes. If no alternatives are found, the child becomes a hospital "boarder
		baby," or a child who resides in a medical facility without medical
		justification.</P> 
	 <P>The number of boarder babies nationwide and the percentage of boarder
		babies who have AIDS are unknown. Of the sites visited, New York City has had
		the most extensive problem. There were 42 boarder babies during one month in
		1987, 35 of whom were HIV infected. The other sites have had only two to three
		boarder babies at one time. Many boarder babies' hospital stays are prolonged
		because of problems in finding foster care homes or in processing the necessary
		paperwork to place them in alternate care arrangements.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">D. Financial Aspects</H3> 
	 <P>No published data were found on the total costs of providing care to
		children with AIDS. There are a number of different estimates on the costs of
		care for AIDS in general, or specifically for adults. Total lifetime costs were
		estimated at $4.85 billion in 1985 in 1985, $8.64 billion in 1986 and projected
		to increase to $66.5 billion by 1991 (Scitovsky, 1987). Estimates for hospital
		care only, from diagnosis to death, range from $27,571 per case in San
		Francisco, California (Scitovsky, 1986) to $50,000 per case (National Academy
		of Science, 1986) to $140,000 per case (Hardy, 1986).</P> 
	 <P>An analysis of the cost of care for HIV infected children at Harlem
		Hospital reports an average cost of $500 per day per child. The per diem ranged
		from $300 to $2,400. The study also showed that 30 percent of the total length
		of stay and 20 percent of the total cost were for unnecessary
		hospitalizations.</P> 
	 <P>The major sources of payment for adult AIDS patients are private
		insurance and Medicaid (Luehrs, 1986). Drug abusers and pediatric cases are
		more likely to rely on Medicaid as the payment source. Persons fitting the CDC
		case definition of AIDS are presumed to be disabled under Social Security
		Administration (SSA) regulation and therefore are eligible for Medicaid if they
		also meet the income eligibility criteria for supplemental security income
		(SSI). This eligibility criteria does not extend to children with ARC or HIV
		infection. Families that are already on Aid for Families with Dependent
		Children (AFDC) are automatically eligible for Medicaid in most States, which
		is often the case for children infected with HIV. AIDS costs will increasingly
		impact upon the Medicaid system because of the enormous expense in caring for
		these children and families. The potential exists for an overwhelming cost
		burden as the number of cases increase.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">E. Service Delivery Approaches and Problems</H3> 
	 <P>Testing and screening of newborns for HIV is not done routinely in any
		of the sites visited. The HIV infected child is first known to the service
		system when he/she becomes symptomatic and enters the health care system. This
		may be at birth, if circumstances suggest the possibility of HIV infection and
		testing is done. Otherwise, recognition is delayed until later in infancy. In
		all three cities, the hospital is the initial provider of services to HIV
		infected children, although many are already known to the social service system
		because of other family situations.</P> 
	 <P>The composition of the team of professionals delivering services to HIV
		infected children at the hospitals visited range from two overworked
		pediatricians at Harlem Hospital to care teams comprised of pediatricians,
		social workers, nurses and psychologists or psychiatrists. The most
		comprehensively staffed care teams are located at medical schools and
		affiliated hospitals that have been able to help support these positions
		through research grants.</P> 
	 <P>Some hospitals have reported difficulties in hiring new staff to care
		for HIV infected children. Harlem hospital has several social work and nurse
		positions that they have been unable to fill. This is due in part to
		preexisting staff shortages, fear of AIDS among professionals, and insufficient
		salaries. Hospitals with additional grant resources have had better success in
		filling staff positions, but have also experienced more difficulty than usual
		in finding staff because of the fear of AIDS. Most of the staff visited at the
		hospitals in New York, Miami and Newark are those who became involved early in
		the epidemic and have dedicated themselves to providing services to HIV
		infected children.</P> 
	 <P>The additional resources from the research grants have enhanced the
		development of medical and social service expertise in the recipient hospitals.
		Many of the services needed by HIV infected children are unavailable in the
		community, or community agencies are unwilling to accept these children because
		of a fear of AIDS. As a result hospitals have taken on new and expanded
		activities, including case management and outreach and some have begun to
		provide services such as day care, counseling and training and education of the
		community. They have evolved into pediatric AIDS treatment and case management
		centers.</P> 
	 <P>The types of services provided to children with HIV infection at all
		hospitals visited are focused on the family needs as much as possible. One
		approach included home visits by a nurse and social worker to assess the
		family's needs. Another approach included referral to the visiting nurse
		association to provide in-home care.</P> 
	 <P>The Children's Hospital of New Jersey, in collaboration with the New
		Jersey Department of Human Services, has described a continuum of care that
		includes training and education of staff and community service providers;
		medical consultation for emergency care, regular medical care, and medical case
		monitoring to ensure consistency in care. A range of social services is also
		described, comprised of: case advocacy in terms of assisting the family to
		obtain needed services; working with State agencies and communities to develop
		needed but unavailable services; providing individual and group support to
		address psychosocial and service needs of natural parents and foster parents;
		providing homemaker and in-home care services; providing transportation to and
		from medical appointments, and placement in alternative care for both respite
		care and regular long term placements.</P> 
	 <P>The persons interviewed identified a need for a coordinated
		maternal-infant approach to medical care and social service delivery. Under the
		present system, mothers/parents are treated under different care systems than
		their children. One example of this is the referral and reimbursement mechanism
		for in-home care in Newark. When a home visit is made for the child, there is
		usually the need to provide services for the mother as well. Under the present
		system, in-home care for the mother takes place under a separate referral
		system, so that the mother's and child's care are not provided in the same
		visit. Since both the mother and the child are likely to be in need of medical
		care, the children's medical and social service providers should maintain close
		contact with the mother's medical and social service providers to ensure that
		appropriate services are being delivered to both, and that their care is
		coordinated. Prescribed medical care and other services for the child need to
		take into account the mother's health condition and home situation.</P> 
	 <P>Service providers also identified social service/reimbursement
		eligibility problems and processing issues. An extreme example of this occurred
		at Harlem Hospital, where in addition to lack of funds and difficulty in
		recruiting personnel, the complexity and intricacies of coordinating Medicaid,
		AFDC, SSI and other financial support programs have posed serious obstacles to
		appropriate care and availability of social support for the children and
		families in desperate need. In one case, the bureaucratic intricacies in
		providing appropriate support for a grandmother to care for an AIDS infected
		youngster could not be surmounted, and the child has remained in the hospital
		for over two years. This unfortunate outcome occurred despite pleas made by the
		Chief of Pediatrics to high placed city, regional and Federal officials. One
		official returned to Harlem Hospital with $191 and a box of used toys that were
		the result of a collection taken up by office personnel in lieu of an ability
		to generate and make the system responsive to obvious patient and family
		needs.</P> 
	 <P>Another example is the complicated process of obtaining Medicaid
		coverage in Hudson County, New Jersey, where three separate applications are
		required and eligibility must be renewed every three months. Service providers
		there report that 47 out of 100 high risk parents do not have Medicaid
		coverage. Personnel in Miami also report that the application process for SSI
		and AFDC is extremely complicated, the stipends are too low, and in some cases,
		processing has taken as long as six weeks. These problems were identified as
		intrinsic to the system as a whole, not as unique to AIDS/HIV infection.
		However, the immediacy of the needs of the AIDS/HIV infected population has
		highlighted these problems. Problems that are specifically AIDS related include
		finding agencies and community services willing to provide services to HIV
		infected clientele. Persons interviewed cited a need for extensive community
		education to put the realities of HIV transmissibility into perspective.</P> 
	 <P>When a child is in need of a foster care home, the hospital usually
		contacts the city or state child service agency. Service providers interviewed
		in all three cities indicated a preference for placing a child with a member of
		the extended family, i.e., "kinship foster care." In fact, in some communities
		such as the Haitian community in Miami, the willingness and ability of extended
		family members to care for the children is so strong that few HIV infected
		children abandoned or without parents are in need of foster care homes.</P> 
	 <P>There are a number of issues and barriers to the kinship foster care
		option. In many cases, the grandmother or aunt who assumes the care of the
		child does not have adequate financial resources to care for the child or cover
		the extensive medical expenses that are likely to occur. In some jurisdictions,
		an extended family member can qualify for foster care payments, and in some
		cases the family may qualify for AFDC and Medicaid. However, in order to obtain
		these income support services, the extended family member must assume legal
		guardianship of the child which involves going through a court process to
		declare the parent incompetent, abusive, or neglectful. Many families are
		unwilling to do this out of loyalty to their offspring or siblings.</P> 
	 <P>Service providers at the sites visited report that kinship foster care
		is neither adequately reimbursed nor expeditiously available. They feel that
		the shortage of foster care homes would not be as acute if adequate provisions
		for this option were made.</P> 
	 <P>In most areas visited the city or State agency contracts with a number
		of private agencies to provide foster care services. There is a reported
		shortage of foster care agencies willing to include HIV infected children in
		their caseloads. Two agencies in New York and Miami have developed special
		programs specifically geared toward placing HIV infected children, and in
		Newark, the Foster Parents Association has become involved in addressing the
		issues of foster parent recruitment. All three jurisdictions offer enhanced
		reimbursement rates for foster families that take HIV infected children. For
		example, in New York the reimbursement rate for HIV seropositive children is
		$1,134 per month as compared to the regular rate of $165-$342 per month,
		depending on age and a special rate of $748 per month for special needs
		children (handicapped, boarder babies, or other hard-to-place). There are
		additional allowances for clothing and other miscellaneous expenses that are
		determined on a per child basis by the contracting agency. In Miami, a foster
		parent receives $2,700 per month for an AIDS/ARC child, and no additional
		allowances are awarded. This compares to the regular rate of $183-$240 per
		month depending on age.</P> 
	 <P>The Leake and Watts Children's Home, one of the contracting agencies in
		New York, has created a special division to handle foster care placement of HIV
		infected children. The agency social workers in this division receive an
		additional $3,000 per year. Leake and Watts has been able to place 24 HIV
		infected children over a 24-month period. Their best source of recruitment has
		been referrals from foster families already caring for HIV infected children.
		Recruitment efforts by other agencies visited included public service
		announcements, information dissemination and education.</P> 
	 <P>All three cities report that children who are already in foster care
		homes when HIV infection is discovered are rarely turned away by the foster
		family. Many have already bonded with the child, and after some education about
		HIV infection and transmissibility, the families opt to keep the child. Persons
		involved in foster care in all three cities identified a number of foster care
		needs and issues. Extensive orientation, training and support services for
		respite care, day care, homemaker services, are needed, as well as attention to
		emotional needs. Several persons interviewed indicated that there weren't
		resources to study and qualify families quickly enough to meet the growing
		needs. Other issues raised included confidentiality, and how many HIV infected
		children should be placed in one home.</P> 
	 <P>The use of congregate care homes for HIV infected children raises
		another set of issues. The personnel running the homes that we visited viewed
		this alternative as a temporary placement until an appropriate foster care home
		could be found. They felt that it was a better alternative than allowing the
		children to stay in the hospital when there was no medical need to be there.
		Others felt strongly that congregate care homes were not good alternatives
		because they do not provide an adequate family environment, the risk of illness
		is too high, and the concept may appear to condone the isolation of HIV
		positive children from their extended families and community. Congregate care
		is not an inexpensive option. St. Claire's Home for Children reports a cost of
		$240 per day per child ($100,000 per year). It is, however, half of some of the
		estimated hospital costs. Congregate care homes may also experience problems
		with community acceptance.</P> 
	 <P>Each of the three cities visited had a different approach to the
		management and coordination of services. In Miami, a planning process that
		involved a variety of community interests was instigated early in the epidemic.
		Public health was notably absent from this process. As part of the planning
		approach, service needs were defined and a special management office was
		created to handle contracting with organizations to provide care and management
		services, education and training, and to conduct research. This office is the
		central receptacle for all AIDS related funding for South Florida. Newark has
		created a State level management group that includes representation from
		various State departments, the Foster Parents Association and community service
		organizations. New York does not have a centralized planning body, but does
		have a network of dedicated professionals who provide services and coordinate
		services to some extent by staying in contact with each other.</P> 
	 <P>Service providers in all three cities were so engrossed in meeting the
		present pressing and undermet needs of children with AIDS that none had any
		plans for how to respond to the projected increases in HIV infected children.
		Although most hospitals visited appeared to be able to handle their present
		caseloads of children with HIV infection, they also appeared to be at their
		limit in terms of physical space, staff and resources.</P> 
	 <P><BR> </P> 
	 <H2><A NAME="chapIII">III. DISCUSSION</A></H2> 
	 <P>This study has identified a number of key issues and problems in
		attempting to deliver services that have been encountered by the three cities
		with the greatest prevalence of children with AIDS. Following is a discussion
		of the most pressing issues that were raised and implications for the
		future.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">A. Magnitude</H3> 
	 <P>There is a large discrepancy between the reported number of AIDS cases
		in children and the number of HIV infected children in need of services.
		Characterization of the magnitude of the problem of AIDS in children has
		focused on the number of AIDS cases reported to CDC when in fact the number of
		children in need of services may be 2.5 to 15 times greater. The total number
		of pediatric AIDS cases reported to CDC by New York, New Jersey and Florida was
		429, which contrasts with a total of 860 cases of HIV infected children that
		have actually been treated by the hospitals visited during the site visits.
		This total also does not include children treated in other cities and hospitals
		not included in the site visits, or unknown cases. Other areas report similar
		discrepancies. Washington, D.C. reported eight cases of children with AIDS and
		116 HIV infected children, and Georgia reported 16 cases of children with AIDS
		and 56 HIV infected children.</P> 
	 <P>Projections for the number of cases by 1991 range from 3,000 official
		AIDS cases to 20,000 HIV infected children. The mortality rate for AIDS is 61
		percent nationwide, so the number of children in need of services won't be as
		high. However, the mortality rates for ARC and HIV infection are unknown, but
		can be assumed to be lower. Projections have focused on the year 1991, and this
		has detracted from the reality that the problem will continue to grow in 1992,
		1993 and for some undetermined time into the future.</P> 
	 <P>The concentration of AIDS cases in children in New York, New Jersey and
		Florida has lessened over the last few years. This is not an indication that
		their numbers have decreased or that their problems have eased, but instead is
		an indication that other states/cities are experiencing growing numbers and
		will soon need to deal with the same problems New York, Newark, and Miami have
		faced. In preparing service delivery approaches, cities and States that are new
		to the problem should consider the total number of HIV infected children to
		estimate demand for services.</P> 
	 <P>The continual increase in the number of infants, children and
		adolescents with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS has greater impact on the health
		and social service system than adults with HIV/ARC/AIDS. Children are more
		dependent for obtaining access to the health care and social service system,
		they cannot manage their own affairs, and they have a more immediate need for
		medical management and social services. Studies have demonstrated that AIDS in
		children progresses more rapidly than in adults.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">B. Health and Social Service Care System Demands</H3> 
	 <P>The site visits illustrated the demands that the AIDS epidemic has
		placed on the health and social service care systems. The population in need of
		services is an already needy population, typically black, Haitian or Hispanic,
		IV drug abusers and single parent families. Added to the problems perpetuated
		by these conditions is that, often with the discovery of an HIV infected child
		comes the discovery of an HIV infected parent and/or sibling, and ultimately
		social ostracism, illness and death. The immediacy of AIDS has highlighted the
		fragmented nature of the care systems, and the eligibility and processing
		problems inherent in these systems. The additional needs of this population
		stress an already overburdened health and social service delivery system and
		heighten the need for new perspectives on service delivery, including a family
		focus and better coordination of services.</P> 
	 <P>There is a need to make available specialized services for this
		population. HIV infected/ARC/AIDS children and their families require frequent
		transportation to health care and specialized medical facilities--and these
		services are sorely lacking. Many of the children with ARC/AIDS suffer from
		neurologic symptoms which lead to developmental disabilities. These children
		require specialized early childhood education programs, which are in very short
		supply. The general population's fears about AIDS transmission exacerbates this
		problem by excluding the ARC/AIDS children from normal educational settings.
		Finally, the caretakers of children with HIV infection/ARC/AIDS, be they
		parents, foster parents, adoptive parents, or extended family members, need
		respite care--facilities that are prepared to accept and manage these children
		for short periods of time. Respite care facilities are almost nonexistent.</P> 
	 <P>Other issues that need to be addressed include coordinated medical care
		for parents and children, day care for infected children and their infected
		siblings, assistance to parents in planning for guardianship arrangements in
		the event of their death, and psychosocial support in dealing with the stress
		of their situation. There are children infected with HIV who act out because of
		the disruption caused by the disease, or who will have to deal with the future
		situation of parental and/or sibling death and loss of a family and/or home.
		There is a need for early and close coordination between the hospital and the
		social service systems.</P> 
	 <P>Even without the advent of the AIDS epidemic, the foster care system has
		been experiencing difficulties. The available pool of new foster parents has
		been decreasing, because of the increase of women working outside the home and
		because of inadequate reimbursement rates. A child with HIV infection, ARC or
		AIDS stresses the foster care system even further, because of the specialized
		needs, concerns and perceived stigma. It has been difficult to recruit foster
		parents for these children. There is a need for specialized training for
		potential foster parents in caring for these children, infection control
		procedures, and dealing with confidentiality of medical information to
		determine "who needs to know" about the child's HIV-infection. There is also a
		need to offer additional support and relief to these parents. Foster care
		reimbursement must be at a level that is appropriate for the childrens'/foster
		parents' needs, including social and respite care support. There is a need to
		expand the pool of potential foster parents by recruiting extended family
		members (grandparents, aunts, uncles) and by considering multiple child
		placements within a foster home. There is also a need for greater
		responsiveness of the system in qualifying families for services.</P> 
	 <P>The use of the CDC AIDS case definition to determine eligibility for
		services and financial support has excluded a major portion of the population
		in need from obtaining services. The case definition was originally implemented
		for disease surveillance purposes, and its use for other purposes has proven to
		be inappropriate.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">C. Boarder Babies</H3> 
	 <P>Much of the media attention and legislative response to the needs of
		AIDS in children has focused on the "boarder baby" problem. As illustrated
		during the site visits, boarder babies are one small part of the service needs
		of the population of HIV infected children. The extent of the boarder baby
		problem varies from city to city. New York has experienced the greatest
		problem, but some "boarder babies" may be waiting for arrangements for a
		parent, grandparent or other relative to assume responsibility and do not
		represent a long term problem.</P> 
	 <P>Although the boarder baby problem is not large in sheer numbers, it is a
		continuing problem. As one child is placed, another may become medically ready
		for discharge and yet may have to stay in the hospital for lack of a foster
		home. The hospital cannot provide an adequately nurturing home environment for
		these children and the cost of care is excessive. Even a few boarder babies can
		place an undue burden on the system.</P> 
	 <P>The boarder baby problem can become significant in the future because of
		the general lack of foster parents in the United States, the lack of foster
		parents willing to care for an HIV infected child, the increasing incidence and
		prevalence of children with HIV infection, and the increasing number of AIDS
		related deaths of parents who are still caring for their HIV infected children.
		The expense of handling a boarder baby can be as high as $200,000 per year and
		as medical expertise in extending the lives of HIV infected children increases,
		the costs for boarder babies in hospitals will increase accordingly. The
		boarder baby problem, however, should not detract from the other, more
		prevalent needs of HIV infected children and their parents.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">D. Financial Resources</H3> 
	 <P>Several medical schools and their affiliated hospitals have sought and
		received federal research grants related to pediatric AIDS and HIV infection.
		Many of these research grants include the delivery of services related to the
		research protocols. This has allowed the medical school/affiliated hospital to
		acquire the services of nurses, social workers, and outreach workers and to
		provide better access to health and social services. The lack of availability
		of professionals in community organizations and agencies willing to provide
		services to HIV infected children has posed a problem to hospital care
		providers. This highlights a need for education and outreach to the community,
		as well as training and retraining of caregivers.</P> 
	 <P>The grant dollars have allowed the recipient hospitals to become
		pediatric AIDS centers with medical and social service expertise. However, the
		grant monies are not a permanent solution. They provide short-term relief for
		selected populations served by the recipient hospitals. Furthermore, the grants
		will not be continued indefinitely and cannot begin to provide all the
		resources necessary for the services needed by the AIDS, ARC and HIV infected
		families.</P> 
	 <P>This study also suggests the importance of enhanced reimbursement rates
		for foster families and enhanced salaries for professionals caring for HIV
		infected children. Reasons cited for enhanced rates and salaries included:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>Compensation for the added precautions necessary to reduce the
			 child's risk of infection</P></LI> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>Compensation for the caregivers increased emotional stress and
			 demands</P></LI> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>To provide a financial incentive to prospective caregivers</P></LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">E. Planning</H3> 
	 <P>Community planning of services for children with HIV infection should
		take into account the special needs of this population. It should consider that
		"AIDS in children is AIDS in families." These families have unique and
		expensive needs requiring specialized medical care, in-home services, and
		income and psychosocial support, to name a few. Some of the current population
		of HIV infected children will die, some will survive and eventually enter the
		school system, and others will manifest severe disabilities and require
		supportive services. All of these groups will pose new sets of issues for
		communities to address. In the future, as these children approach adolescence,
		some will experiment with drugs and sex, thereby placing others at risk. There
		are presently more than 200 adolescents with AIDS. Uninfected adolescents are
		also a potential reservoir for acquiring new infection because of sexual and
		drug abuse experimentation. Specialized educational and outreach programs are
		needed to reach this population. Communities will face the need to plan for
		primary and secondary prevention activities with special emphasis on groups
		that are difficult to reach. Communities need to be aware of the complex
		service needs posed by the AIDS epidemic in infants, children, adolescents and
		their families, and to focus specialized outreach and prevention programs to
		this group.</P> 
	 <P>In addition to planning for the present needs of the current population
		of HIV infected children and their changing needs as they grow older,
		communities must also be prepared to plan for the increasing number of children
		that will be born with HIV infection.</P> 
	 <P>Even in cities that have maximized resources and provided effective
		coordination of services for the present population of HIV infected children,
		any significant increase in AIDS stricken children may have an overwhelming
		impact upon resources and personnel. It may result in an increase of boarder
		babies and create a major additional burden on hospitals, foster care placement
		agencies, and other service providers. It could also magnify the financial
		drain upon Medicaid and other financial aid programs.</P> 
	 <P>As the number of cases rises in cities that have not yet had to deal
		with large numbers of HIV infected children and their accompanying problems and
		needs, plans will have to be made to target resources to address these needs.
		The early experiences of New York, New Jersey and Miami can lend some guidance
		to these cities' planning processes to help alleviate potential problems in
		service delivery.</P> 
	 <P>Miami's planning approach, which includes a centralized regional
		planning group with a broad range of community representatives and one AIDS
		services contracting source, appears to be the best equipped to handle the
		likely increased number of cases. Planning for AIDS in children should be
		included within a community AIDS planning process for all AIDS-stricken
		populations but should focus on the unique issues and circumstances of HIV
		infected children. The planning process should involve those providing direct
		services to children with HIV infection and their families. A planning process
		that is too far removed from the service deliverers may not have the
		appropriate interactions needed to design effective and coordinated responses
		to service needs.</P> 
	 <P>The evolving nature of the epidemic of AIDS in children calls for
		continual monitoring of trends in case numbers, service demands and economic
		impact, as well as changing opinions about testing, screening, confidentiality,
		community acceptance and support. All of these result in shifts that may
		outdate present solutions. Such forces argue for periodically evaluating the
		situation, planning for change, and anticipating increasing or different
		pressures upon the system. It became apparent that these and other issues
		demanded further attention and study. These issues are outlined in
		<A HREF="#appendJ">Appendix J</A>. Each community planning process must have an
		element that relates these continued changes specifically to the service
		delivery approaches for children with HIV infection.</P>

	 <P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG>:</P> 
	 <P>A family with AIDS is usually poor and hispanic at black. They are
		subject to an atmosphere of stigma and condemnation. Caring for children with
		AIDS requires multifaceted assistance to the entire family, including helping
		parents cope with denial, sorrow, guilt; mobilizing family support; making
		child custody arrangements; changing sexual behaviors to prevent transmission;
		and obtaining income support, medical care, and housing assistance. Services
		and education must be given in a culturally sensitive way to be effective.
		Poverty and drug abuse are major contributors to the spread of AIDS and must be
		addressed. Ignorance, fear and discrimination can block the delivery of
		services, once social workers can identify their own concerns they will be
		better able to help other professions.</P>

	 <P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG>:</P> 
	 <P>Pediatric AIDS occurs predominantly in children of poor and minority
		families, where one or both parents are drug abusers. Problems in foster care
		placement have arisen from agencies' reluctance or refusal to place a child
		with AIDS and difficulty in finding parents willing to take a child with AIDS.
		The foster care agency must communicate accurately the nature of the illness
		without overly frightening potential foster parents, yet cannot falsely
		minimize the risks. Foster parents caring for a child with AIDS face special
		challenges:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>ostracism in obtaining needed services (dental, school, etc.)</LI> 
		<LI>ostracism among friends and neighbors</LI> 
		<LI>frequent visits to medical centers and managing medication

		<LI>recurrent and serious medical crises, and potential loss of the

	 <P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG>:</P> 
	 <P>Children with AIDS and their families present challenges to human
		service agencies and the multiple problems produced by AIDS require a high
		degree of collaboration and cooperation among agencies, workers and families.
		25% of children in Children's Hospital in Newark are already in foster care
		before AIDS is diagnosed. Foster care parents need special assistance. Agencies
		often refuse to provide services, and service workers in public and private
		companies often don't understand how AIDS is transmitted. Concealing the
		diagnosis may obtain service but does nothing to improve accessibility.
		Services needed include transportation, respite care, baby sitting, home care,
		help in obtaining benefits, emotional support and counseling, basic training
		and education for service workers, resource materials, recruitment and training
		for foster parents, use of consultants with expertise in Health care for AIDS
		children and support groups for workers and foster parents.</P>

	 <P>Ho <B>et. al.</B> offers an excellent, updated and comprehensive review
		of the mechanism of disease genesis by the Human Immunodeficiency virus. The
		primary clinical syndromes resulting from HIV infection are AIDS and AIDS
		dementia complex (also called subacute encephalitis and AIDS encephalopathy).
		The author's review of the literature demonstrates that approximately 60% of
		AIDS patients have neurologic symptoms, and 80-90% are found to have
		neuropathologic changes at necropsy. Subacute encephalitis is the most common
		neurologic problem in AIDS and is characterized by poor memory, inability to
		concentrate, apathy and psychomoter retardation. In addition, focal motor
		abnormalities and behavioral changes may occur, leading to a full-blown
		dementia complex.</P> 
	 <P>The article also reviews the persistence of HIV, concluding that very
		little cell-free virus is found in infected persons and that less than 0.01% of
		circulating lymphocytes express detectable HIV messenger RNA. Thus, much of the
		HIV appears <B>not</B> to be susceptible to immune clearance!</P>

	 <P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG>:</P> 
	 <P>Guidelines regarding education have been established by NEA, CDC and
		AAP. All three recommend that only those most likely to infect others be
		excluded froin public school. NEA and CDC also have guidelines for foster care
		and day care. Many states have adopted policies on educational placement
		similar to CDC's and NEA's. A few have made sane significant changes (e.g.,
		requiring notification of school system and department of health when a case is
		diagnosed). By 1985, nine states had enacted some form of AIDS legislation, a
		relatively small number deal with pediatric AIDS. Some legal challenges have
		arisen; the NY court decision upholding the cities policy to allow AIDS
		children to attend school is summarized. This is an important case since tne
		policy was modeled after CDC's recommendation.</P> 
	 <P>Issues about public care of children with AIDS have not received as much
		attention. Although CDC's recommendations address day care and foster care,
		they recommend restricted day care for preschool AIDS victims, and screening
		high risk children in foster care of adoption agencies. Several state agencies'
		policies are described.</P>

	 <P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG>:</P> 
	 <P>Data on Medicaid costs are limited. Most cases are paid for by private
		insurance or Medicaid. Drug abusers are more likely to rely on public funding.
		The 1983 SSA directive; person with diagnosis of AIDS is presumed to be
		disabled, makes these persons eligible for Medicaid if they also meet income
		and resource standards for SSI. (Families on AFDC are automatically eligible
		for Medicaid). MI and MD have collected limited data on Medicaid expenditures.
		In MI, the average cost per patient was $52,230 with average of 20-month
		eligibility. In MD average was between $13,000 and $18,800 per patient with
		8-month eligibility. MediCal (CA Medicaid) reported $59,000 average cost per
		patient. Costs can vary between high risk groups and the infections they are
		likely to have. San Francisco General Hospital's low costs of $25-32,000 per
		patient may be attributable to their comprehensive case management approach.
		Two types of Medicaid waivers may improve Medicaid coverage for AIDS patients:
		Freedom of choice waivers and home and community-based model waivers. Both
		require data showing cost savings of alternatives as compared to traditional
		hospital care.</P> 
	 <P><STRONG>Issues/Recommendations</STRONG>:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Impact of AIDS on Medicaid costs is unclear</LI> 
		<LI>As more IV drug users, their spouses and children become infected
		  with AIDS, the Medicaid costs will rise and will impact on state budgets</LI> 
		<LI>States may need to use wavier programs more extensively to provide

	 <P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG>:</P> 
	 <P>Celeste Carrion, age 9 and brother both have AIDS. Mother died of AIDS
		and the father also has AIDS. The children now live with their grandmother.
		They represent the typical pediatric AIDS case--poor, hispanic (or black), and
		drug addicted parent(s) who also have AIDS. Dr. James Okeske, from College of
		Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey estimates that the number of pediatric
		AIDS cases could reach 20,000 by 1991. In New York, an estimated 1,000
		HIV-infected babies will be born this year. In the past year there have been
		nine cases in New York in whicl neither parent abused drugs but the mother's
		former lover did, an indication that the problem could move into the
		heterosexual non drug abusing population.</P> 
	 <P>Those dealing with pediatric AIDS predict that the system cannot handle
		the problem; there has been resistance among health care professionals to
		provide services, and the general public is overreacting with fear. Money is
		needed for medical research, treatment and foster care.</P> 
	 <P>About half of the babies born to AIDS-infected mothers have been
		infected; symptoms often don't appear for 3-4 months. Early treatment is
		important because AIDS tends to cause bacterial infections and babies can die
		from the infection very quickly. Some doctors use gamma globulin treatment;
		others are skeptical of its success relative to its expense--about $18,000 per
		patient per year. Another experimental drug, AZT, is currently being tested in
		30 children. The Einstein College of Medicine in New York and the Newark
		Children's Hospital see many pediatric AIDS cases and sue multidisciplinary
		support teams to treat the many medical needs of the patients, including
		psychologists, physical therapists, speech specialists, and counselors.
		Counseling the family is as important as treating the child.</P>

		among the 35,000 IV drug abuser populations, two out of three are HIV infected.
		Their sexual partners and offspring are at high risk of becoming infected.
		Infants are also at high risk for low birth weight, drug withdrawal and
		environmental and emotional deprivation. The median age of onset of AIDS is six
		months; very few survive over an extended period of time. Educating high risk

	 <P>A number of different bills have been introduced in both the House and
		Senate, some specific to children with AIDS and some in response to the AIDS
		problem in general with provisions that would impact on children with AIDS.
		There have also been several different hearings held.</P> 
	 <P>A variety of issues were identified by the Senate, Representative and
		Committee staff contacted. These included:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Problems with Medicare/Medicaid processing </LI> 
		<LI>Fragmented services, lack of coordination between social services and

		  problems.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Summary--Minority and AIDS Service Organizations</H3> 
	 <P>The National Urban League felt that the public knows little or nothing
		about the pediatric AIDS problem and that there is very little information
		being disseminated to the general public. Minority organizations need
		resources--specifically dollars--for launching an information/education effort
		through their affiliated chapters. In addition, it was felt that the Federal
		Government should provide leadership in this area because of its potential
		magnitude. An invitation was extended to visit the local affiliates in New
		York, Newark and Miami during the site analysis phase of the project.</P> 
	 <P>The Minority Task Force on AIDS of the Council of Churches, City of New
		York is fully involved in delivery of services to AIDS families. There is a
		strong desire to maintain family structure during the management of AIDS in
		families. Suggestions were made for welfare reform to allow case management for
		the family, as opposed to individuals. An "AIDS Care Corps" was recommended
		along the lines of the Peace Corps. The Corps would be federally operated and
		fund local personnel to act as homemakers, counselors, companions, and
		surrogate parents to AIDS families. The primary reason for federal management
		of the program is to bypass the union limitations and job categories which
		presently exist at the local level. In addition, the present system of support
		to AIDS families cannot be sustained by volunteers for an indefinite time
		period. Other suggestions included:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI>Need to allow cross-race adoption</LI> 
		<LI>Need to work with and support women coming out of prison</LI> 
		<LI>Need specially allocated funds for providing appropriate nutrition
		  and food preparation training to women</LI> 
		<LI>Need to make telephone service a necessity</LI> 
		<LI>Need allowances for travel--hospital, day care, etc. </LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>The National Conference of Puerto Rican Women is in the planning stages
		for an adolescent pregnancy media campaign. They have been asked by the federal
		contractor to add in information about AIDS and pediatric AIDS. The
		organization felt very strongly that there is a great need for AIDS awareness
		to at risk females and their partners: at hangouts, methadone programs and via
		specialized media. In addition, there is not enough foster care services for
		children with AIDS.</P> 
	 <P>COSSSMHO, an Hispanic coordinating organization noted that they are part
		of an advisory group for the Ford Foundation for analyzing the pediatric AIDS
		problem into the year 2000. The group has made projections, but no information
		can be released until the Ford Foundation Board of Trustees reviews and
		approves the material. However, site visits to organizations and facilities
		working on the pediatric AIDS problem has led the group to appreciate the fact
		that pediatric AIDS is a family issue, and that the health care system is very
		sympathetic to AIDS babies, but not to their HIV infected, or AIDS parents.
		COSSMHO believes that the system has generally not reached the groups at
		highest risk for health related problems--AIDS only magnifies the problem
		COSSMHO feels that there should be greater work with child abuse and sexual
		abuse groups as well as with the Justice Department which has, and funds, major
		outreach projects.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Summary--Federal Agencies</H3> 
	 <P>The Office of Minority Health of the Office of the Assistant Secretary
		for Health felt that finances were the critical issue related to pediatric
		AIDS. Pediatric AIDS also demonstrates major geographic differences, such that
		cities like New York will, face severe fiscal crises, including hospital
		closings and hospitals picking and choosing AIDS patients. Pediatric AIDS is a
		minority problem. It compounds the many other health related problems already
		facing this group. Pediatric AIDS will have many more survivors than with adult
		AIDS, most will be unprovided for. A recommendation was made to review and
		refer to Secretary Heckler's Report on Minority Health to appreciate the impact
		of other major health problems on the minority communities of the United
		States.</P> 
	 <P>Health Resources and Services Administration has focused its activities
		on planning and holding AIDS meetings for constituency groups, specifically,
		AAP and ACOG. The Surgeon General's "Workshop on Children with HIV Infection
		and their Families" (April 6-9, 1987) offered a series of recommendations.
		Several of the key points are:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>Need ongoing education and training of health professionals</P></LI>
		
		<LI> 
		  <P>The education efforts should not be a "one shot" activity, need
			 ongoing repetitive efforts, which happen to be very manpower dependent (labor
			 intensive).</P></LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P>HRSA outlined four areas of importance in pediatric AIDS:</P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI> 
		  <P>The need for early detection for high risk women. Women should be
			 provided the opportunity for confidential testing.</P></LI> 
		<LI>

	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">A. New York City</H3> 
	 <P>The New York City site visit took place from October 26-29, 1987. The
		site team included Mr. Martin Kotler, Dr. Stephen Margolis and Ms. Lela
		Baughman of MACRO and Mr. Jerry Silverman of ASPE.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">1. Organizations Visited</H4> 
	 <P>Three hospitals/medical centers, in three boroughs of New York were
		visited, including Harlem Hospital in Manhattan, Einstein medical School/Center
		in the Bronx and SUNY Downstate/Kings County Medical Center in Brooklyn.
		Ninety-six percent of New York City's AIDS or AIDS related illnesses in
		children are managed by these units.</P> 
	 <P>The Regional Administrator and staff members of the DHHS Region II
		Office were interviewed because of their interest in the "boarder baby" problem
		related to AIDS. The staff had prepared a report on "boarder babies" in New
		York and New Jersey.</P> 
	 <P>New York City personnel interviewed included the Commissioner of Health,
		the Deputy Commissioner for Community Services, the Director of AIDS
		Surveillance, and the Director of Special Services for Children.</P> 
	 <P>Staff of the State of New York Division of Substance Abuse were
		interviewed because approximately 79 percent of children with AIDS are related
		to a parent who is an IV drug abuser (AIDS Surveillance Update).</P> 
	 <P>The President and Chief Operating officer of Hale House and Hale House
		Cradle, a home for totally abandoned or temporarily placed children and infants
		was visited. in addition, the Leake and Watt's Children's Home, which places
		children in foster care was interviewed by telephone.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">2. Magnitude of the Problem</H4> 
	 <P>As of September 30, 1987, the City of New York reported a total of 221
		cases of AIDS in children, according to the official CDC case definition, of
		which 161 cases, 73 percent had died by the reporting date. Seventy-nine
		percent of the cases were the probable result of maternal transmission where
		one or both parents were IV drug abusers, or the mother was a former sex
		partner of an IV drug abuser. 59 percent of mothers of pediatric AIDS cases are
		black, 32 percent Hispanic and nine percent are white.</P> 
	 <P>The City of New York does not routinely perform HIV antibody tests on
		pregnant women or neonates. All available HIV antibody seropositivity
		information were from small-scale studies currently in progress. According to
		the AIDS Surveillance Unit, there have been approximately 500 case of AIDS
		Related Complex (ARC) and a "guesstimate" of 2,000 seropositive infants and
		children, cumulatively. In addition, the reporting system in place in New York
		City has been checked and found to match in 94 percent of reported cases. Many
		studies are being developed, or have begun that will increase the database
		related to children with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS in New York.</P> 
	 <P>In a pilot, prospective prenatal care study with seropositive, pregnant
		women, only nine percent chose to terminate their pregnancy after counseling
		efforts. Only two measles related deaths in children with AIDS who have been
		immunized with live virus vaccines have been noted.</P> 
	 <P>The City of New York has approximately a total of 18,500 children in
		foster care placement. There are approximately 100 ARC/AIDS children in foster
		care of which 14 died during the last year. During September, 1987, 35 infants
		and children with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS who were medically ready for
		discharge from a hospital were still in residence or "boarder babies." This
		represents 80 percent of all boarder babies in New York City.</P> 
	 <P>Predictions have been made concerning the future magnitude of the
		pediatric HIV/ARC/AIDS problem for New York City. The CDC predicts that by 1991
		there will be a cumulative total of 3,000 officially defined pediatric AIDS
		cases in the United States, approximately 1,000 of which will be in New York.
		The Health Department of the city of New York predicts approximately 10,000
		cumulative pediatric HIV/ARC/AIDS cases in the United States. The State of New
		York Substance Abuse Agency predicts that approximately 2,000 HIV/ARC/AIDS
		children will be born to IV drug abusing mothers by 1991. This projection is
		based upon 50,000 IV drug abusing women and 100,000 sexual partners of IV drug
		abusers in New York City.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">3. Description and Response of the System</H4> 
	 <P>Children with AIDS, ARC or who are HIV antibody seropositive in New York
		City are first managed by one of the major hospital centers. The types of
		services offered to both the children and their parents is a function of the
		staff and resources of the hospital.</P> 
	 <P><B>Harlem Hospital</B>. The Harlem Hospital pediatrics unit has a
		dedicated Chief of Pediatrics and an AIDS team composed of one physician for
		six to eight hospitalized HIV infected children. Harlem Hospital is dependent
		on tax levy funds and is underfunded, and this has led to periodic shortages in
		necessary pharmaceuticals. In addition, it has been very difficult to fill open
		positions for nurses and social workers.</P> 
	 <P>The pediatric unit has 60 beds, and cumulatively, 60 HIV infected
		children have been managed on the unit since 1982. The maximum number of HIV
		infected children on the unit at any one time has been 12.</P> 
	 <P>An analysis of the cost for caring for 37 children with HIV infection
		since 1982, has been $3,362,596, of which 30 percent of the hospital days and
		20 percent of the cost have been estimated as unnecessary for medical reasons.
		The per diem ranged from $300 to $2,400, with an average of $500.</P> 
	 <P>The staff has not been able to plan for increases in HIV infected
		children or increases in boarder babies expected over the next four years. The
		Harlem Hospital AIDS Unit has attracted a lot of recent national attention,
		including a visit by the Administrator of HCFA and the Surgeon General of the
		United States.</P> 
	 <P>Harlem Hospital, serving one of the poorest and most heavily drug
		infected areas in the country, has limited resources to apply to pediatric
		AIDS. In addition to lack of funds, difficulty in recruiting personnel, the
		complexity and intricacies of coordinating Medicaid, AFDC, SSI and other
		financial support programs pose serious obstacles to appropriate care and
		availability of social support for the children and families in desperate need.
		For example, the bureaucratic intricacies in providing appropriate support for
		a grandmother to care for an AIDS infected youngster could not be surmounted,
		and the child has remained in the hospital for over two years. This unfortunate
		outcome occurred despite pleas made by the Chief of Pediatrics to high placed
		city, regional and Federal officials. One official returned to Harlem Hospital
		with $191 and a box of used toys that were the result of a collection taken up
		by office personnel in lieu of an ability to generate and make the system
		responsive to obvious patient and family needs.</P> 
	 <P><B>Albert Einstein Medical School</B>. The Albert Einstein Medical
		School/Center complex handles 34 percent of New York City's HIV infected
		children. There are four hospitals, geographically dispersed within the Bronx,
		that are involved in the Einstein consortium: Montefiore Hospital, Einstein
		College Hospital, Jacobi Hospital and North Central Bronx Hospital. Each
		hospital has different medical specializations and children/infants in need of
		hospitalization are placed in the appropriate facility.</P> 
	 <P>The Einstein consortium has two major AIDS pediatric immunology grants
		from NIH which allow HIV infected children/infants to be enrolled in either an
		immunoglobin therapy study or a perinatal transmission study. They also receive
		funding from the State, and a Robert Wood Johnson Grant for Comprehensive
		Family Care. Physician, nurse and social worker positions are covered by the
		funding sources for the studies and for relevant service delivery.</P> 
	 <P>Approximately 300 seropositive children/infants are presently enrolled
		in the immunoglobin therapy study on an outpatient basis, of which
		approximately 30 symptomatic children require short stay admissions on a
		biweekly basis. Today, if a child/infant is HIV seropositive, a nurse and
		social worker can evaluate the home situation. In addition, there is an AIDS
		pediatric hotline and specialized service delivery components available to
		families and their HIV infected children.</P> 
	 <P>In 1984 there were four to six ARC/AIDS boarder babies, but all of them
		have since been placed in foster care.</P> 
	 <P>The Einstein staff opposes the use of group/congregate care facilities.
		Their feeling is that foster care, with the easing of extended family member
		eligibility, and additional respite care and specialized day care for working
		foster parents could handle the boarder baby problem. They are also concerned
		that group care will increase the likelihood of transmission of opportunistic
		infection among AIDS infected infants.</P> 
	 <P>The staff has planned for the projected increases in HIV infected
		children or boarder babies over the next four years.</P> 
	 <P><B>SUNY Downstate Kings County</B>. The SUNY Downstate/Kings County
		complex has managed 110 pediatric HIV infected children since 1981, of which 44
		have died. Children are admitted to either the King County Hospital or the
		Downstate medical Center. There are three to four children hospitalized at any
		one time; however, there have been as many as eight to nine hospitalized. There
		has been a total of seven boarder babies. Daily costs are $552 per day.</P> 
	 <P>The SUNY Downstate/Kings County group have major pediatric AIDS research
		grants which allows the staffing and servicing of their HIV infected children.
		A study carried out at the medical center revealed that 2 percent of the
		pregnant women coming for prenatal care are HIV seropositive, and 58 percent of
		those infected admitted or knew of any involvement in high risk behavior.</P> 
	 <P>Another study of 28 ARC/AIDS infants, demonstrated that 27 had
		neurological deficits and 85 percent failed to thrive. The staff has not
		planned for the projected increases in the number of HIV infected children, or
		increase in boarder babies over the next four years. There was a general
		feeling on the part of the SUNY Downstate/Kings County Staff that voluntary
		child service agencies and New York City agencies were not actively and
		vigorously dealing with HIV infected, ARC or AIDS children, and that this
		needed to be corrected. In addition, there have been breeches of
		confidentiality within these agencies.</P> 
	 <P>The group felt that there was a need for use of extended family members
		and community members as foster care parents and that there was a need for a
		day care/respite facility near the medical complex. The staff strongly opposes
		the use of congregate care homes.</P> 
	 <P><B>Foster Care Services</B>. The City of New York has approximately
		18,500 children in foster care placement. There are approximately 100 ARC/AIDS
		children in foster care of which 14 died during the last year. The majority of
		HIV positive children in foster care were placed before their seropositivity
		was known. During September, 1987, 35 infants and children with HIV infection,
		ARC or AIDS who were medically ready for discharge from a hospital were still
		in residence or 'boarder babies." This represents 80 percent of all boarder
		babies in New York City.</P> 
	 <P>Foster care is handled by New York City's Special Services for Children
		(SSC). SSC contracts with a number of agencies to assist in foster care
		placement. The primary agencies for foster care placement of children with AIDS
		are the Leake and Watts Children's Home, New York Foundling home, and the
		Archdiocese of New York. New York City has authorized the payment of $1,134 per
		month to foster parents of HIV seropositive children. This compares to the
		regular rate of $165-$342 per month depending upon age, and the special rate
		for special needs children (handicaps, boarder babies, other hard-to-place) of
		$748/month. There are additional allowances for clothing and other
		miscellaneous expenses which are determined on a per child basis by the
		contracting agency.</P> 
	 <P>Two draft documents have been promulgated related to foster care for HIV
		infected children, namely: "New York City HIV Testing Policy for Foster
		Boarding Home Children" and the "Department of Health Protocol for Implementing
		HIV Testing: Policy For Foster Boarding Home Children." These policies mandate
		a training requirement for foster parents of HIV seropositive children; define
		a stringent mechanism for testing of foster children; outline the appropriate
		confidentiality issues related to testing; and ensure that seropositive
		children will be retested every three months.</P> 
	 <P>The SSC is in the process of putting into place alternate models for
		managing families with AIDS, namely: recruiting homemakers for assignment to
		AIDS families; and creating congregate shelters for AIDS families. The City of
		New York is handling social service costs related to HIV infected children, but
		would like to see changes in New York State Medicaid reimbursement, homemaker
		services and foster care funding.</P> 
	 <P>The Leake and Watts Children's Home has created a special division to
		handle foster care placement of HIV infected children. Twenty-four infected
		children have been placed in a 24-month period. The agency was originally
		utilized by the Einstein consortium, but is now under contract to New York
		City's SSC. It receives a stipend of $100/day/child from SSC for administrative
		activities. Each foster parent of a symptomatic HIV infected child receives
		$1,134/month which is a pass through from SSC. The agency determines an
		additional stipend ranging from $400-$800 per month for special needs and the
		placement of a home helper, under special circumstances. This comes out of the
		agencies' administrative reimbursements. The agency social workers dealing with
		HIV infected children are paid an additional $3,000 per year. Leake and Watts
		have been able to find people who are interested in becoming foster parents.
		Their best source has been referral from families who already are foster
		parents.</P> 
	 <P>Hale House and the newly formed Hale House Cradle are designed as
		temporary homes for women and their children, or for the temporary housing of
		infants and children while the mothers are in drug treatment, incarcerated or
		recuperating. Mother Hale and her daughter Dr. Lorraine Hale are opposed to
		foster care because of a study showing the 60 percent of the studied children
		were sexually abused in foster homes. SSC funds Hale House at a rate of
		$161/day/child to manage up to 15 children, although they always have 20
		children in residence. The children range from newborn to three years of age
		and there are four HIV infected children in residence. Hale House does not lack
		finances or personnel, but it is desperately lacking an appropriate facility
		for future activities.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">B. Newark/Jersey City/Trenton</H3> 
	 <P>The New Jersey visit took place on November 2 and 3, 1987 Ms. Lela
		Baughman and Dr. Stephen Margolis conducted the site visit.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">1. Organizations Visited</H4> 
	 <P>Two hospitals in two major New Jersey cities were visited, including
		Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark and the Pediatrics Unit of the
		Jersey City Medical Center. In addition, interviews were conducted with
		personnel from the Community Health Care of North Jersey, a visiting nurse
		service which works very closely with the Children's Hospital of New Jersey and
		carries out home care management of HIV infected children.</P> 
	 <P>The State of New Jersey has a pediatric AIDS committee that deals with
		social service, foster care and funding issues. The committee has the following
		membership who were interviewed: New Jersey Foster Parents Association; New
		Jersey State Central Region Administration; State of New Jersey Division of
		Youth and Family Services; the New Jersey Department of Health; the New Jersey
		Department of Education; and the Hyaninth Foundation.</P> 
	 <P>The St. Claire's Home for Children in Elizabeth, New Jersey is a five
		child group home for HIV infected children. In addition, the organization
		operates the AIDS Resource Foundation for Children, in Newark, New Jersey. The
		personnel were interviewed at the Elizabeth facility.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">2. Magnitude of the Problem</H4> 
	 <P>New Jersey, as of October 1, 1987, had 84 officially reported cases of
		AIDS in children. Seventy-five, or 89 percent of the pediatric AIDS cases were
		from a parent with, or at risk for AIDS. Sixty-two percent of the pediatric
		cases are black, 20 percent are Hispanic and 12 percent are white. The State of
		New Jersey is readjusting its reporting system to account for the expanded CDC
		AIDS definition and a review of the State's ARC registry, which contains
		approximately 3,000 adult and pediatric cases. As the State AIDS surveillance
		report concludes: "Because of the combined influence of these factors,
		predictions of trends are now extremely unreliable. When things settle down, we
		can estimate that there will be 50 percent more AIDS cases reported in any
		given time period than under the old definition. As we gather more data, we
		will be better able to expand our monthly surveillance reports to reflect the
		impact of the new changes."</P> 
	 <P>There are 102 children with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS known to the
		Division of Youth and Family Services. Twenty-two are in foster care, 62 at
		home, 12 in the hospital, five in a group home and one is missing or
		unknown.</P> 
	 <P>The personnel of the Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark,
		calculate that there have been between 150-200 children with AIDS, ARC or
		symptomatic HIV infection treated at Children's hospital since 1981. The
		hospital is following 96 children, of whom 62 percent are black, two percent
		are of Haitian descent, 16 percent are Hispanic and 20 percent are white.
		Ninety percent of the 96 children had mothers who were IV drug abusers or
		sexual contacts to men at risk for AIDS. At any one time, 12-20 of the children
		from Newark with ARC or AIDS are managed by the visiting nurse service. The
		Jersey City Medical Center, the other primary management facility for HIV
		infected children, has registered 20 children with AIDS, of which three have
		died.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">3. Description and Response of the System </H4> 
	 <P><B>Children's Hospital of New Jersey</B>. A great majority of AIDS
		patients in the Essex County area are handled by the Children's Hospital of New
		Jersey in Newark. The pediatric AIDS team of the Children's Hospital is
		composed of a pediatrician, a research nurse, a social worker, an
		administrative assistant and the visiting nurse service liaison.</P> 
	 <P>The Newark hospital has a major AIDS treatment grant from the NIH, which
		supports the staffing of the unit.</P> 
	 <P>There is no HIV testing at the primary delivery hospital, University
		Hospital, thus children are made known to Children's Hospital, mainly when they
		become symptomatic. Although Children's has seen between 150 and 200 children
		with HIV infection since the epidemic began, they are currently managing 90
		children and others are being managed by other facilities in the city. Five of
		the 90 children are HIV antibody positive and 85 have either ARC or AIDS and
		there have been 34 deaths (35 percent). Fifty-five of 60 children with ARC or
		AIDS were shown to have developmental disabilities.</P> 
	 <P>The Children's Hospital Pediatric AIDS team has a very close working
		relationship with the Division of Youth and Family Services and the visiting
		nurse service, which allows for the coordination of medical and social
		services. In general children have rarely been abandoned (only 2-3 occasions),
		most stay with parent(s) or, if the parents are sick, then with extended
		family. There is need for an intermediate care facility, specifically a group
		home for mothers and their babies in need of medical care. In addition, the
		present pediatric facility at Children's Hospital is not large enough for the
		delivery of services.</P> 
	 <P>The Community Health Care of North Jersey, the visiting nurse service,
		carries out an initial home visit with a hospital social worker to evaluate the
		status in the home. The Medicaid reimbursement for a home visit to pediatric
		patients is only $65 a visit. A non-AIDS home visit is usually of 30 minutes
		duration, but an AIDS visit can be 1.5 hours long. There is usually a need to
		offer services to the mother, but reimbursement can occur only under a separate
		referral mechanism and the parent and child home visits cannot be easily
		combined. Thus, there is need for a combined maternal and child health delivery
		approach. In addition, the visiting nurses require personal security because of
		the assault and robbery problems in the neighborhoods they visit. Further,
		hospital supply delivery services will not deliver to many sites without the
		visiting nurse's security guard accompanying them.</P> 
	 <P>The City of Newark administration has until now virtually ignored the
		AIDS problem and the City Health Department has denied that there is a unique
		problem in Newark. These attitudes have a detrimental effect on the
		coordination and delivery of needed services to adults and children with AIDS.
		There is a new health commissioner, who has a community health background. The
		Health Department will be mounting a public education campaign which will be
		delivered with the water bill.</P> 
	 <P>The AIDS Resource Foundation for Children is a Newark-based organization
		that carries on educational outreach in Newark, but has had to establish a
		transitional foster care residence for children with HIV in Elizabeth, Now
		Jersey. This residence, The St. Claire's Home for Children can handle up to
		five infants/children at any one time. There is always a waiting list. The Home
		receives moral and fiscal support form the St. Elizabeth Hospital, the New
		Jersey Department of Health and the Division of Youth and Family Services.
		Since the Home cannot increase above five children at any one time because of
		the prohibitive safety and alteration costs, there are plans to build several
		additional homes to handle children in Newark and in the Monmouth County
		section of New Jersey. It costs approximately $240/day/child ($60,000 per child
		per year). St. Claire's is not yet on a sound fiscal basis.</P> 
	 <P><B>Jersey City Medical Center</B>. Hudson County, the home of the Jersey
		City Medical Center is second to Essex County (Newark) in reported AIDS cases.
		The Jersey City Medical Center handles approximately 3,000 deliveries per year
		and has a diverse patient population which is 40 percent black, 40 percent
		Hispanic and the remainder Indian, korean, Arabic speaking and white. Fourteen
		to 15 percent of this population receives no prenatal care and 60-70 percent
		are high risk deliveries (teenage mother, no prenatal care, drug use, infected
		with an STD). A study, ongoing since July 1985, has found 53 HIV antibody
		positive neonates. The boarder baby problem is not severe. There have been two
		children who spent up to five months in the hospital for non medical reasons.
		One of the children was successfully placed with a male gay foster couple. In
		addition, a media campaign to search for foster parents led to 60
		candidates.</P> 
	 <P>Obtaining Medicaid coverage in Hudson County is a very complicated
		process. Three separate applications are needed and eligibility must be renewed
		every three months. This leads to the finding that 47 out of 100 high risk
		parents do not have Medicaid coverage.</P> 
	 <P>The medical center is involved in a gamma globulin therapy protocol for
		HIV positive children; however, it receives no special compensation or
		additional personal.</P> 
	 <P>The staff of the Jersey City Medical Center felt that there was a lack
		of social service outreach activities, and transportation capabilities for
		their patient's' families.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">C. Miami/Dade County</H3> 
	 <P>The site visit took place on November 17-19, 1987. The site visit team
		included Dr. J. William Flynt, Dr. Stephen Margolis, and Ms. Lela Baughman of
		Macro, and Ms. Ann Segal of ASPE.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">1. Organizations Visited </H4> 
	 <P>The AIDS Program Manager for Dade County and the Executive Director of
		the primary community-based AIDS organization, "Health Crisis Network" were
		interviewed because of their involvement in community outreach programs. The
		Florida State Contracts Office and the South Florida AIDS Network were
		interviewed because of their involvement in the funding and management of AIDS
		programs for Dade County and South Florida. The primary health care facility,
		Jackson Memorial Hospital, and the primary child care/placement organization,
		Children's Home Society were visited to review the status of service delivery
		to children with HIV infection, ARC and/or AIDS. In addition, during the site
		visit, the team became aware of the activities of the Health Council of South
		Florida, and a special visit was arranged.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">2. Magnitude of the Problem </H4> 
	 <P>Florida ranks third in the United States in officially reported
		pediatric AIDS cases. Although the official number of pediatric cases was 82
		(of which 32 have died) as of November 1987, the primary health care facility
		of South Florida has dealt with 190 HIV antibody positive, ARC or AIDS
		children, of which 60 have died. This primary hospital has approximately 14,000
		births per year and a projection of one to two percent HIV antibody positivity
		among pregnant women. AIDS boarder babies are not a major problem--there have
		been five, but one has been in the hospital for 2.5 years.</P> 
	 <P>The vast majority of pediatric AIDS cases are among women of Haitian
		descent, living in Miami. There is very little AIDS related outreach and
		education taking place in the Haitian areas of Miami and many women do not
		understand, or refuse to appreciate their risk for AIDS virus infection and the
		potential for transfer to their offspring. This will have significant impact on
		the number of pediatric AIDS cases in Miami in the future. In addition, today,
		there does not appear to be a significant problem of pediatric AIDS where the
		parent is a drug abuser, or sexual partner of an IV drug abusers. Of the total
		caseload seen at Jackson Memorial, 25 percent are born to IV drug abusing
		women. This finding is somewhat surprising considering that 79 percent of the
		cases in New York are related to IV drug abuse and that Miami is reported to
		have a large IV drug abusing population.</P> 
	 <H4 ALIGN="CENTER">3. Description and Response of the System </H4> 
	 <P>Jackson Memorial Hospital is the primary medical facility for managing
		children with HIV infection, ARC or AIDS. There is a separate inpatient and a
		shared outpatient facility for the management of this patient population.
		Staffing is not a problem, partially because of the funds available from the
		many research studies which have been awarded to Jackson Memorial and its
		affiliated medical school, the University of Miami. There are 15 active
		projects underway, four of which are related to the pediatric AIDS population.
		Approximately 100 Miami high risk families are followed through one of the
		studies, and one family per week is entered into these studies. A social worker
		and nurse routinely make home visits for recruitment and support purposes.
		Hospital social work staff report significant problems in applying for Aid For
		Dependent Children.</P> 
	 <P>The South Florida AIDS Network is the primary funding and coordinating
		unit for AIDS in South Florida and is responsible for (1) care and management
		of patients; (2) education and training; (3) research management; and (4) legal
		and ethical issues. Funds are funneled through the South Florida AIDS Network
		and include: a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant ($400,000), a HRSA Clinical
		Demonstration Site grant ($600,000), and funds from the State of Florida
		($6,800,000). The Network is housed at Jackson Memorial Hospital, which
		facilitates close coordination between the funding management source and the
		service delivery facility.</P> 
	 <P>The South Florida AIDS Network handles all subcontracts for services,
		including foster care and child care. A foster parent is paid $2,700 per month
		for foster care for an AIDS/ARC child. This amount includes all activities and
		is not supplemented, as is the case in other jurisdictions. A foster parent is
		paid the regular foster care rates directly from the State and receives an
		enhanced rate from the South Florida AIDS Network. The State is approximately
		four months behind in issuance of checks to foster parents. There is general
		belief that the success of the Miami pediatric and adult AIDS service
		activities is based upon the planning activity undertaken by the Health Council
		of South Florida. This group facilitated the development and accomplishment of
		a six month planning process which included the input from more than 150 people
		with varied interest in the AIDS problem.</P> 
	 <P>The Health Crisis Network is a community-based outreach organization
		that began its activities in 1983. Its original focus was to the Miami gay
		community, but it has expanded its counseling and outreach activities to the
		heterosexual communities of Miami, specifically to women and to Haitians. It
		receives some of its funding through the South Florida AIDS Network. The
		organization operates a hotline, including a Creole speaking operator, and
		funds a community outreach nurse for a half day per week at a local community
		center in the Haitian part of Miami. A primary concern of the organization is
		the need for counseling and outreach to siblings of HIV infected children. The
		problem of AIDS so devastates a family's structure and functioning that
		multiple social services outreach is needed. The organization operates a
		support group for 28 high risk women, but does not have the staff for
		psychosocial outreach to families with AIDS.</P> 
	 <P>The Dade County AIDS Unit is primarily focused upon providing voluntary
		and confidential testing and counseling. Although the County operates six
		health clinics, any HIV seropositive/ARC/AIDS child coming to these facilities
		is sent to Jackson Memorial Hospital for management. The staffs of these
		clinics do not perceive the black communities to be at risk for AIDS, and this
		has affected their prevention and education activities. There is very little
		AIDS prevention outreach occurring, especially in the Haitian community.</P> 
	 <P>A system is being developed that would link by computer the County
		community health centers to the Jackson Memorial Hospital. This would allow
		better tracking and management of patients.</P> 
	 <P>There have been a variety of foster care approaches in Miami. Foster
		care placement of HIV positive children was initially handled by the State, but
		now the South Florida AIDS Network has contracted with the Children's Home
		Society to handle the foster care placement for this population. As of the site
		visit, no children had actually been placed with foster parents by this agency.
		However, two nurses from Jackson Memorial Hospital have left their nursing
		positions to become foster parents to HIV/ARC/AIDS infants and children, and
		each has several placements living with them. The Society also operates a
		shelter for children and will be handling HIV positive/ARC and AIDS clients.
		The Society is worried about the problem of infected teenagers and how they
		will be handled in the future.</P>
