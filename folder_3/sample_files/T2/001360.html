Subject: Proposed Regulation FD: File No. S7-31-99
------------------------------- Message Contents 
This issue is important to me as an individual investor.              
     
I have read some of the public comments of April 6, 2000, by The Ad 
Hoc Working Group on Proposed Regulation FD and the Legal and 
Compliance Division of the Securities Industry Association ("SIA").   
     
It seems to me the SIA argues that individual investors are not 
intelligent enough to make their own decisions about the value of 
securities and need Wall Street's analysts to hear and interpret 
important information first.                                          
     
I whole heartedly disagree with this assessment.                      
     
I do not feel maintaining the current system is in my own interests and 
support the proposed rule (Proposed Regulation FD) by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the fair disclosure of 
information by publicly traded companies to the public.            
     
Regards,

Subject: Level Playing Field/File No. S7-31-99
------------------------------- Message Contents 
I am only an individual investor but would like to address my support for 
full public disclosure. Analysts' reputations should be built on superior 
education and analytic skills, not receiving information first. Seeing as 
how its OUR money, neither should I nor my peers be subject to anymore 
"stratified" restrictions of information than absolutely necessary. There is 
no way in the world that the current regulations do not cultivate an air of 
distrust and an over-riding suspicion of favoritism towards larger 
institutional investors and those on the inside track. This in turn creates 
a huge schism of unspoken animosity which feeds all sorts of political and 
social friction. That is not good for business or Wall Street.
     
While regulations may be in place to muzzle companies what prevents favored 
clients of analysts and any other number of incidental individuals once 
removed, from catching soon-to-be-released sell or buy recommendations 
before they hit the press?
     
When ever I hear anyone (such as defenders of the current system) speak of 
how they wish to prevent me from hurting myself (Supposedly because I am 
incapable of digesting news without their assistance) I know immediately 
that someone has their hand in my pocket and is bristling at the notion that 
they are not entitled to keep it there. This is classic elitism, essentially 
demonizing the democratic notion of free access to information and 
individual responsibility.
     
I say let the analyst forewarn and interpret all they wish but I strenuously 
object to the notion that they have either the facts or right to determine 
my level of intelligence and comprehension. In my own investing experience 
I've done far better ignoring consensus opinions than following and perhaps 
if they were forced to work with the same info as the rest of us they could 
come to be viewed for their service as practitioners of independent 
viewpoints rather than the unofficial spokespeople they appear to be now. 
One look at the number of stocks recommended vs. those ranked as sells 
against the resultant overall advancers vs. decliners shows that the current 
system is overwhelmingly and inaccurately skewed towards the promotion of 
buying under-performing stocks. A fairer system should and would be more 
objective. That is impossible if the analysts "edge" requires the pampering 
of privilege from the very company they are supposed to be objectively 
evaluating. The argument that companies may be less willing to reveal 
"negatives" if discussions are no longer 'private and confidential" are 
silly, as those who attempt to hide will only risk greater punishment and 
tarnished reputations. If the negatives aren't critical then why should one 
set of individuals outside of the company be "in the know" and not others?
     
It looks to me like the choice to leave the current system unchallenged is 
nothing more than a desire to maintain a hierarchy of privileged 
information. We invest our money in good faith and already have to ferret 
the intentions and futures of the company, fight bid-ask spreads, accept 
market maker shenanigans, pay commissions, be disqualified from the 
lucrative private placements of wealthier individuals, accept extreme option 
packages for employees and officers that further dilute our holdings, 
passively allow ourselves to be pushed and pulled by all manner of federal 
and political shifts, such as money supply and interest rate changes, plus 
withstand various fires fanned by popular press and brace against all the 
normal unknowns- which all work to diminish our returns yet we are somehow 
expected to invest trustingly so that in the end we ideally receive a modest 
profit for our trouble and willingness to lend money. Are we also supposed 
to accept the idea of restricted information interpreted for us as well? 
These are supposed to be PUBLIC Companies, right? I mean I never read a 
prospectus that defined the business as a publicly held company constructed 
with a secondary circle of power entrusted to analysts.
     
Its not an accident that the strength of the current economy goes hand in 
hand with the renewed public willingness to invest. While some may decry the 
volatility of public over-reaction, it is equally true that the level of 
interest and understanding in all manner of American business is at an all 
time high. It is the democratization of this process through the internet 
and information access which has spurred this renaissance and it will be an 
ill advised desire to dampen that spirit by attempting to leash it back 
under the control of a privileged few which will destroy it. Progress 
depends on moving forward with the times over the objections of the 
entrenched few that are always more than happy to keep things as they are.
     
Public companies should report to the public without intervention of 
intermediaries. Let individuals and analysts find out all the facts together 
at the same time and then in the light of day let the chips fall where they 
may. Unlike the patronizing attitudes of brokers, I have a great deal of 
trust in the ability of the common man to sort things out for a better 
future.
     
Thank you for listening to my opinion.

To whom it may concern:
I would encourage you to change rules that currently allow companies to give 
important information to Wall Street analysts without giving the news to the 
general public at the same time.
Increased access to information makes us all better investors. Let analysts 
keep their job as analysts, but don't make them gatekeepers to information we 
can use and interpret for ourselves.

Dear Uncle Sam:
     
I'm a small investor (under $250,000) in the US stock markets, and I think 
that what goes on at the high-roller level is a pile of bullshit.  I 
subscribe to numerous financial publications, have a college degree and 
read prospectuses for all of the companies I invest in.  While I'm 
interested in what the Market Makers think about a given offering, I want 
access to the same information that they have in order to form my own 
opinions.  I also don't like the conflict of interest that the Analysts 
have due to their own company holdings.
     
Give the American public access to the same information as the Market 
Makers and give it to us at the same time and let us use it as we will.

Hello,
     
I am writing to support the SEC's proposal to put an end to selective 
disclosure (Proposed Regulation FD: File No. S7-31-99). In the interest of 
fairness in the open market and respect for the public, it makes little 
sense to oppose this proposal.
     
I have read arguments that analysts, who currently have privileged access to 
corporate information, serve to stabilize the market by filtering this 
information and preventing an uneducated, emotional response from individual 
investors. This is both offensive and untrue. To assume that individual 
investors are the cause of market volatility is to deny the fact that most 
individual investors, and indeed the most successful investors, are those who 
put their money behind strong companies and leave it there throughout the 
peaks and valleys of day-to-day activity. I would argue, rather, that it is 
the Wall Street analyst, whose market "predictions" and "trends" and 
"buy/sell ratings" are quoted in the evening news, who are responsible for 
volatility.
     
Individual investors who have full access to corporate information, the 
ability to research their areas of corporate interest, and a strong interest 
in the results of their investment dollars are going to be far more loyal to 
their investments than the institutions who rely on professional analysts. 
This loyalty will translate into stability for companies who withstand 
public scrutiny.
     
I often watch political debates and speeches. On network news stations, 
these events are inevitably followed by "expert analysis" of what's been 
said. Though occasionally these recaps provide some context and explanation 
for the original speech, they are most often irritatingly simplistic and 
shortsighted. This is analogous to the situation at hand. As a voting 
citizen, I am better informed and more demanding of my representatives in 
government if I hear their words directly. As an individual investor, I am 
better informed and more demanding of my investment if I have equal access 
to corporate information. A fair analyst may help to contextualize this 
information, but without the source data, I have no way of verifying (and 
cannot trust) these opinions.
     
Thank you for reading my opinion in this matter. Please support the SEC's 
proposal for equal disclosure of corporate information.

It is my opinion that information related to company information currently 
provided to only a select few on Wall Street should be open information to 
everyone interested in such.
     
This is too important an issue to leave in the hands of a few Wall Street 
insiders to work with on behalf of the millions of stock market investors.
     
I am in support of making this information available to everyone who wants it 
given the easier ability electronically to access such.
     
Thank You.

I am writing to express my support of Proposed Regulation FD: File No.

professional analyst to do it for me, it is only fair that nobody gets it

I am writing to express my report for changing the selective disclosure 
rules so that companies must make public disclosure, rather than disclosure 
to select groups of analysts.
     
SEC rules currently regulate insider trading within a company, but the 
current rules allow the equivalent by those analysts who have access to 
information withheld from the rest of the market. This places them at a 
distinct advantage compared to other investers.

information by publicly traded companies to the public.  The profit of analysts 
must not come at the expense of the people who they are supposed to be helping.

Proposed Regulation FD: File No. S7-31-99
     
I am greatly in favor of the proposed rule banning the practice of 
selective disclosure.
Particularly in today's market where many investors, like myself, rely 
on their own resources to make investment decisions, having only a 
select group of analysts privy
to important information is a great disservice.  True, analysts may 
provide valuable
insight by filtering the information and providing their opinions, but 
their opinions are
just that: opinions.  I may reach different conclusions from the same 
data - but only if I'm
provided with the data.  Analysts may still provide their services to 
their clients, but they
should not have any exclusive access to material facts.  Otherwise I am 
denied the opportunity to analyze the facts myself and reach my own 
conclusions - which may or may not take into account an analysts opinion 
regarding the same data.

Dear Sirs-
     
As an individual investor, I think it's criminal that a small group of analysts 
get privileged access to company information. As a shareholder in several 
companies, I feel that I should have equal access to the same information so 
that I can make my own interpretation of the information without having it 
filtered through some analyst, who may have another agenda besides fair and full
disclosure.
     
I don't believe that this will cause market volatility. To the contrary. How 
often does a stock move strongly right before some important piece of 
information comes out. It's pretty obvious that someone besides the individual 
investor has access to the information. This leads to speculation and people 
trading stocks based on the stock's movement, with the assumption of some big 
piece of news. Thus, investors trade on little or no information or at best 
rumors. This cannot be healthy for the overall market.
     
I am also insulted that the Wall Street establishment does not believe that I am
qualified to analyze this information myself. I am a buy-and-hold investor, and 
I have done quite well over these last few years by finding good companies, 
often when the analysts are nearly unanimously against a company, and holding on
to them. I am not a day trader, but an investor who has learned to read a 
balance sheet and understand something about business, both by investing in 
several and frankly, working for one.
     
Given the nature of information distribution, it is now feasible for a company 
to release information to analysts as well as the "average" shareholder at the 
same time. Some of the companies I invest in, like Checkfree corporation, open 
their conference calls live to all investors as well as the analysts. I am proud
that some companies are heading in the right direction. Please encourage all of 
them to do the same.
     
Thank you,

In today's fast-moving information environment, a level playing field is 
long overdue.  I don't care if the SIA argues that individual investors are 
not intelligent enough to make their own decisions about the value of 
securities and need Wall Street's analysts to hear and interpret important 
information first.  The SIA and full service brokerages need to go the way 
of the blacksmith and get out of everyone's way.

I understand that this rule would require, among other things, that 
companies no longer engage in the practice of discreetly disclosing 
important information to Wall Street analysts without also giving that 
information to the public at large. It sounds like a pretty commonsense 
rule to   me, one that many investors might logically assume must already 
BE law, but unfortunately isn't.  Pass it.

Dear Sir or Madame:
     
It is essential in a free society that the playing field for financial 
decisions be as level as possible.  The special interests such as analysts, 
etc. should not receive information any earlier than the public.  The 
Internet has made information more accessible, and the SEC has been at the 
forefront to protect the public and the small investor.  Certain Wall Street 
professionals feel the public and small investors are too dumb to understand 
the information, and want to have the information first.  This is dangerous 
for the markets, and the reasons put forth are self serving to say the least. 
 The public and small investors are more knowlegeable than at any other time 
in our history, and it is important not to put them at a disadvantage as 
urged by Wall Street.  Wall Street needs to remember that its analysts are 
often wrong, and there are currently allegations that some analysts give 
their opinions to some of their large customers before rendering their 
decisions to the remainder of their customers and the public.  This is 
reprehensible, and the SEC needs to overcome the possibility of this problem 
by making information available to all.  I make my own investing decisions 
after collecting all the information that I can about a company.  I have been 
investing since I got out of Vietnam in 1969.   I feel I can make good 
decisions, but I want the information at the same time as everyone else. Wall 
Street professionals who want to get the information first are looking out 
for their financial interests, not for the interests of others.  Thank you 
for your consideration.

Dear SEC,
     
I urge you to implement rules against selective disclosure by companies.  It 
is unfair to the owners (shareholders) of companies to have them disclose 
information only to security analysts and/or institutional investors. 
Information should be made available, at the same time, to the public, small 
investors, and the media.  I urge you to put into place rules that encourage 
public disclosure of company information, not selective disclosure.  Thank 
you.
     
Sincerely,

I strongly belive that selective disclosure is wrong and gives investment firms 
a tremendous and unfair advantage over individual investors such as myself. 
Often I feel that what they say does not match what they do with their own funds
and their own analyst portfolio's,ie promote buying while they sell or promote 
selling while they buy. I personally would like to see analyst be required to 
state positions personnally held in stocks being upgraded or downgraded so 
ordinary investors might look for possible bias in the recommendation. Not 
quantity, just held long/short, or not held. Please level the playing field. 
Also take a look at the more recent sites promoting whisper numbers, some seem 
to be easily manipulated by anyone with a desire to influence stock price either
up or down.

SEC,
     
I'm an individual investor and in my opinion, selective disclosure isn't 
much different from a Microsoft or AT&T monopoly. Therefore, I think 
that any and all company info that is disclosed to Wall Street analysts 
should simultaneously be given to the public at large.
     
Thanks for the opportunity to voice my opinion.

I SUPPORT the SEC proposed regulation for fair disclosure of material 
corporate information.  Given a level playing field, the Wall Street 
analysts are going to have to learn how to earn their keep by creating some 
sort of value from their analyses, rather than just being the people who get 
to hear first what's going on with companies.  It's just NOT right to have 
"selective disclosure" to them.
