<a name="1"></a><p><strong>1.&nbsp; AHRQ Study Finds Harmful Medication Errors in Children</strong></p>

<p>Medication errors that harm hospitalized children are common, and the drugs involved in many of these mistakes tend to be some of the oldest and most commonly used painkillers and antibiotics, according to a new AHRQ-supported study.</p>

<p>Published in the August 2006 issue of the <em>Journal of Pediatric Nursing</em>, the study found that from 1999 to 2003, 19,350 pediatric medication error reports were received by the U.S. Pharmacopeia MEDMARX reporting system from 160 U.S. hospitals and health centers. In 4.2 percent of these cases, the records show that medication errors caused harm to the patient. Eleven of the 242 different medications involved in harmful outcomes were involved in more than one-third of the errors. Older, commonly used drugs were also associated with a considerable number of harmful errors. Wrong dosing and omission errors were common and were associated with therapeutic classes such as opioid analgesics, antimicrobials, and antidiabetic agents.</p>

<p>The study was conducted by Rodney W. Hicks, M.P.A., M.S.N., and his colleagues at the United States Pharmacopeia Center for the Advancement of Patient Safety, under a partnership with the AHRQ-sponsored University of North Carolina Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics in Chapel Hill.

<a name="2"></a><p><strong>2.&nbsp; AHRQ Releases Evaluation of Military Medical Team Training Programs</strong></p>

<p>AHRQ released a report evaluating three medical team training programs designed for military hospitals. Prepared by the American Institutes of Research at the request of AHRQ and the Department of Defense's (DoD) TRICARE program, the report is part of an ongoing collaborative effort between AHRQ and DoD to promote patient safety based on principles of good communication and teamwork.</p>

<p>The programs reviewed&#8212;MedTeams&#8482;, Medical Team Management, and Dynamics Outcomes Management&copy;&#8212;are adapted from the U.S. Army's Crew Resource Management training system. Investigators reviewed student and instructor guides and other materials, attended classes, and collected pre- and post-training information on the students' expectations and post-training reactions to the programs. They found that the programs shared several desirable characteristics, notably their use of active learning techniques and interdisciplinary approaches. They suggested several needed improvements, including comprehensive pretraining needs analysis, opportunities for structured practice and feedback, and strategies for post-training reinforcement.</p>

<a name="3"></a><p><strong>3.&nbsp; AHRQ Patient Safety Grantee Ellen Flink and Her Colleagues Work To Improve Adverse Event Reporting Within Hospitals</strong></p>

<p>AHRQ patient safety researcher Ellen Flink, M.B.A., Director of Research in Patient Safety and Quality Initiatives in the Office of Health Systems Management for the New York State Department of Health, and a team of multidisciplinary investigators have been examining ways to improve the reporting of medical errors within hospitals and develop interventions that could improve patient safety. With AHRQ's support, Ms. Flink and her colleagues worked with the New York Patient Occurrence Reporting and Tracking System to develop interventions for three common adverse events: new pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis; peri-operative acute myocardial infarction (unrelated to cardiac procedure); and postoperative wound infections.</p>

<p>To learn more about Ellen Flink's research, access the following <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=15035855">abstract</a> examining the connection between organizational factors, medical errors, and patient safety; and, several articles that appear in <em><a href="/qual/advances/">AHRQ's Advances in Patient Safety: From Research to Implementation</a></em>&#8212;a four-volume set of 140 peer-reviewed articles that represent what federally funded programs have accomplished in understanding medical errors and implementing programs to improve patient safety over the last 5 years.</p>
     
<a name="4"></a><p><strong>4.&nbsp; Institute of Medicine Releases Report on Preventing Medication Errors</strong></p>

<p><em>Preventing Medication Errors</em>, a report issued by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) on July 20, puts forth a national agenda for reducing medication errors based on estimates of the incidence and cost of such errors and evidence on the efficacy of various prevention strategies. The report finds an average of 1.5 million medication errors occur every year, costing the Nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.</p>

<p>The report also outlines a comprehensive approach to decreasing the prevalence of these errors. This approach will require changes from doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and others in the health care industry including, the FDA and other government agencies, hospitals and other health-care organizations, and patients.

<a name="5"></a><p><strong>5.&nbsp; New Regulations To Facilitate Adoption of Health Information Technology</strong></p>

<p>HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt announced last week the final regulations that will support physician adoption of electronic prescribing and electronic health records technology. The final rules create new exceptions and safe harbors to two key Federal fraud and abuse laws for arrangements involving the donation of certain electronic health information technology and services.</p>

<a name="6"></a><p><strong>6.&nbsp; New Statistical Brief Shows Potentially Preventable Hospitalizations Are Common Among Blacks and Hispanics</strong></p>

<p>According to a recent AHRQ report, blacks are almost five times more likely than non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics are almost four times more likely than non-Hispanic whites, to be hospitalized for uncontrolled diabetes and other conditions that good quality outpatient medical care can often prevent or control. This statistical brief is produced by AHRQ's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP).</p>

<p>The statistical briefs are useful to a wide variety of audiences, including policy analysts, decisionmakers, media personnel, and others in need of summary facts and figures on current health care issues. For more information, access the report, <em><a href="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb10.jsp">HCUP Statistical Brief No. 10: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Potentially Preventable Hospitalizations, 2003</a></em>.</p>

<a name="7"></a><p><strong>7.&nbsp; ISMP and FDA Campaign Aims To Eliminate Use of Error-Prone Medical Abbreviations</strong></p>

<p>The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently launched an educational campaign to help eliminate the use of ambiguous and error-prone medical abbreviations, symbols, and dose designations-a practice that contributes to the more than 7,000 medication errors each year, according to the IOM.</p>

<p>ISMP and FDA recommend that ISMP's <a href="http://www.ismp.org/tools/errorproneabbreviations.pdf">list of error-prone abbreviations, symbols, and dose designations</a> (<a href="/news/pdfhelp.htm">PDF Help</a>) be referenced whenever and wherever medical information is being communicated. The campaign seeks to educate health care professionals and students, medical writers, and the pharmaceutical industry, through a variety of targeted educational materials, including a patient safety video and an online toolkit. Select to access the <a href="http://www.ismp.org/tools/abbreviations/default.asp">toolkit</a> and to learn more.</p>

<a name="8"></a><p><strong>8.&nbsp; AHRQ Selects Members for Quality Indicators Risk Adjustment Workgroup</strong></p>
