1.Important Information About the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)

VAERS was created by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to receive reports about adverse events that may be associated with vaccines.  No prescription drug or biological product, such as a vaccine, is completely free from side effects.  Vaccines protect many people from dangerous illnesses, but vaccines, like drugs, can cause side effects, a small percentage of which may be serious.  VAERS is used to continually monitor reports to determine whether any vaccine or vaccine lot has a higher than expected rate of events.

Doctors and other vaccine providers are encouraged to report adverse events, even if they are not certain that the vaccination was the cause.  Since it is difficult to distinguish a coincidental event from one truly caused by a vaccine, the VAERS database will contain events of both types.

In addition, it is often the case that more than one vaccine was administered, making it difficult to know to which of the vaccines the event might be attributed.  In analyzing individual reports, researchers examine the medical information about the event, and obtain more specific information from the reporters whenever necessary.  Patterns of reporting associated with vaccines and vaccine lots are also analyzed.

More than 80% of vaccine adverse event reports concern relatively minor events, such as fevers or redness and swelling at the injection site.  The remaining reports (less than 20%) describe serious events, such as hospitalizations, life-threatening illnesses, or deaths.  The reports of serious events are of greatest concern and receive the most careful scrutiny by VAERS staff.

VAERS researchers apply procedures and methods of analysis to help us closely monitor the safety of vaccines. When a concern arises, action is taken. We hope that this brief explanation of the factors associated with vaccines and adverse events will assist you in understanding the data you are viewing.

2.Brief Description of VAERS

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) established the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is co-administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), to accept all reports of suspected adverse events, in all age groups, after the administration of any U.S. licensed vaccine.  On November 1, 1990 VAERS replaced CDC's Monitoring System for Adverse Events Following Immunization (MSAEFI) for public sector reporting and FDA's Spontaneous Reporting System for private sector and manufacturer reporting.  The primary purpose for maintaining the database is to serve as an early warning or signaling system for adverse events not detected during pre-market testing. In addition, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA) requires health care providers and vaccine manufacturers to report to the DHHS specific adverse events following the administration of those vaccines outlined in the Act.

All reports are coded and entered into the VAERS database.  The adverse events described in each report were coded utilizing the FDA's Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) from November 1990 until January 16 2007.  On January 17 2007 the VAERS coding system was converted to an international coding system that is used worldwide.  This system is called the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The MedDRA coding system uses key words representing the medical condition(s) described in the case report and converts them to standardized codes. An individual VAERS report in these files may include up to a total of 8 vaccines administered and 20 MedDRA terms describing the event. The MedDRA codes provided in the dataset are called the "Preferred Terms"; there are more than 17,000 Preferred Term codes in the MedDRA system. The MedDRA coding system is more detailed than the COSTART system, which is comprised of 5,817 codes.  Therefore the MedDRA system is not only standardized for international use, it is also able to code medical terms in a more exacting manner than the COSTART system design. All the COSTART codes that were used in the VAERS data prior to (January 17, 2007) have been converted to MedDRA coding terms. The MedDRA coding system is updated semi-annually, and terms may be added, deleted or changed with each new release. VAERS reports are coded using the MedDRA version in effect at the time the codes are entered; therefore, different terms may be used to describe similar events in reports coded at different times.

3.VAERS Data Should be Interpreted with Caution

       ·VAERS data are from a passive surveillance system and represent unverified reports of health events that occur after vaccination.  Such data are subject to limitations of under-reporting, simultaneous administration of multiple vaccine antigens, reporting bias, and lack of incidence rates in unvaccinated comparison groups. 
       ·When reporting and evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause and effect relationship has been established.  The event may have been related to an underlying disease or condition, to medications being taken concurrently, or may have occurred by chance.
       ·A report often involves more than one vaccine and may involve more than one reported adverse event.
       ·In certain cases VAERS requests additional information from reporters, healthcare providers and other parties. The status, event description and medical codes associated with a report are subject to change upon receipt of such additional information.
       ·When multiple reports of a single case or event are received, only the first report received is included in the publicly accessible dataset. Subsequent reports may contain additional or conflicting data, and there is no assurance that the data provided in the public dataset is the most accurate or current available.
       ·A given report may meet more than one criterion for classification as "serious."
       ·Accumulations of events reported to a passive surveillance system do not allow incidence rate calculations due to the generally unknown extent of under-reporting as well as lack of information on the number of people being vaccinated.
 

4.Description of Data Files

VAERS data is accessible by two mechanisms: by downloading raw data in comma-separated value (CSV) files for import into a database, spreadsheet or text editing program, or by use of the CDC WONDER online search tool.

The downloadable VAERS public data set consists of two separate data files.  These files are provided by calendar year beginning with the first VAERS reports reported in the latter part of 1990.  The public data set is updated on a monthly basis.  In the following tables, "Box" refers to the numbered items or "boxes" on the VAERS form.  Comma-separated-value (CSV) files are industry-standard text files compatible with most of the major database or statistical analysis products on the market.  Each data set is available for download in 2 formats: as a pair of CSV files, or as a compressed Zip file that contains the two CSV files listed for the specific year.

CDC WONDER, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is an easy-to-use, menu-driven system requiring no computer expertise or special software, that provides access to a wide array of public health information. With CDC WONDER you can produce tables, maps, charts and data extracts showing the incidence of vaccine adverse events, and select specific event, vaccine and demographic criteria to produce cross-tabulated incidence measures. You can also limit and index your data by several variables. VAERS data is available on CDC WONDER at http://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html. Additional information about CDC WONDER is available at http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html. 

4.1 VAERSDATA.CSV

The following table provides a detailed description of the data provided in each field of the VAERSDATA.CSV file.  Each row in the table refers to a separate field (or column) in the data.  The "Header" provides the field name or column "header."  "Type" describes the type of data contained in the data field.  The information in parenthesis specifies the data format or number of digits or characters contained in the field.  There are three data types: NUM = numeric data;  CHAR = text or "character" data; and DATE = date fields in mm/dd/yy format.  With the exception of the first two fields, each row in the table pertains to information recorded in (or derived from) the various numbered sections of the VAERS-1 form.  No data is provided that would allow identification of any individuals associated with these reports.
