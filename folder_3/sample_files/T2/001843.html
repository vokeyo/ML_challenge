A
 federation of the colonies had first been considered in the 1840s but it was
 not until the end of the century that sufficient unity on such subjects as
 defence and trade was finally realized. The achievement seems even more
 remarkable if one goes back another 100 years and considers the state of the
 embryo colony in 1801. The small population, living in an alien environment,
 included large numbers of convicts; crime, corruption, disease and squalor
 were rife. By the end of transportation on the East Coast in the 1840s the
 Colony of New South Wales was well established. More and more free settlers
 were involved in trade and agriculture, helping to bring some success and
 stability. At the same time a number of former convicts were, through their
 ability and determination, making substantial contributions to the colony's
 development. By the 1850s 165 000 convicts had been transported to Australia
 while well over 200 000 free migrants arrived between 1825 and 1850.<p>The First Fleet, as it later came to be known, arrived on Australia's East
 Coast in 1788. It comprised eleven ships bearing around 1400 people, half of
 whom were convicts. Between 1788 and 1868, when the last convict ship docked
 in Fremantle, over a hundred medical men are known to have arrived as
 transportees<sup><a href="#ref1" class="cite-reflink">1</a></sup>. With
 no standardization of medical qualification in the early nineteenth century,
 many would have been unqualified. Of those who came during this period three
 men, well known to each other in Sydney, are recognized for their medical
 abilities and as founding fathers of several respected institutions which
 developed as the settlement turned from a gaol into a colony. Many of those
 transported were not criminals in the true sense, but found themselves
 crossing the oceans as a result of some youthful, impetuous statement or
 action<sup><a href="#ref2" class="cite-reflink">2</a></sup>.</p><p>William Redfern, who has been called the father of Australian medicine,
 arrived as a convict in 1801 and was given an absolute pardon three years
 later. D'Arcy Wentworth barely escaped conviction, and was forced to embark
 for Australia in 1790 aboard the <em>Neptune</em>, one of the three ships of
 the notorious Second Fleet, in which just under a third of the voyagers died
 during the journey<sup><a href="#ref3" class="cite-reflink">3</a></sup>.
 William Bland arrived as a convict in 1814 and was pardoned a year later. All
 three were well known to Lachlan Macquarie, the longserving Governor who held
 office from 1810 until
 1821<sup><a href="#ref4" class="cite-reflink">4</a></sup>. Macquarie,
 born on the Isle of Mull, governed as a paternalistic autocratic laird and
 brought discipline and some order to the chaos he found in New South Wales.
 His predecessor, William Bligh, already known for his bravery after the mutiny
 on HMS <em>Bounty</em>, had attempted to control the import of large
 quantities of rum, traded by the New South Wales Corps. Furious with Bligh,
 members of the &#x02018;Rum Corps&#x02019;, as they were known, arrested him, and
 wielded considerable power until the arrival of Macquarie. The new Governor
 was not popular with those who had come as free men, among whom was the
 arrogant pastoralist John Macarthur. They were known as the
 &#x02018;exclusives&#x02019; while ex-convicts, however successful they became,
 never lost the stigma of being &#x02018;emancipists&#x02019;. The latter were
 considered beyond hope by many, but Macquarie felt they might have talents
 which could be of great use to the
 colony<sup><a href="#ref5" class="cite-reflink">5</a></sup>. He employed
 the ex-convict Francis Greenway, a former pupil of Nash, to design
 distinguished buildings in the growing town of Sydney, and he chose Redfern as
 his family doctor.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>WILLIAM REDFERN</a></div><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id122015" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">D'ARCY WENTWORTH</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id122094" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">WILLIAM BLAND</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id558009" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id121745">WILLIAM REDFERN</div><div class="section-content"><p>William Redfern, from a Trowbridge family, was born in 1778, and may have
 received some surgical training in Edinburgh. He did not collect his diploma
 after passing the examination of the Company of Surgeons. Joining the Navy in
 1797 he was appointed assistant surgeon on HMS <em>Standard</em>. He
 encouraged the sailors to present a united front at the Mutiny of the Nore
 and, as a result, was sentenced to death with 59
 others<sup><a href="#ref6" class="cite-reflink">6</a></sup>. On account
 of his youth, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was
 transported in 1801 aboard <em>Minerva</em> to the penal colony at Norfolk
 Island. He impressed the Governor with his medical skills, was pardoned in
 1803 and in 1808 became assistant surgeon at the Dawes Point Convict Hospital
 in Sydney. To prove his abilities he agreed to appear before three of the
 colony's doctors, and so became the first Australian medical
 graduate<sup><a href="#ref5" class="cite-reflink">5</a></sup>.</p><p>He spent his mornings in the hospital and saw private patients in the
 afternoons. His knowledge and skills soon won him a high reputation, though
 his manner could be brusque, especially when reference was made to his
 emancipist status. Even John Macarthur, the most powerful exclusive, entrusted
 his family to Redfern's
 care<sup><a href="#ref7" class="cite-reflink">7</a></sup>. In 1813
 Lachlan Macquarie declared, &#x02018;I consider Mr Redfern as a professional man
 a very great acquisition to the Colony&#x02019;. A year later he asked Redfern
 to examine convict health&#x02014;an invitation that further enhanced the
 doctor's reputation. While the health of those who came with the First Fleet
 had been surprisingly good, this was not the case with subsequent voyages.
 Convicts were housed on board in appallingly cramped conditions, and
 dysentery, scurvy, typhus, typhoid and venereal disease were rife. Those who
 survived the voyage often remained too weak to make a useful contribution to
 the growing colony<sup><a href="#ref8" class="cite-reflink">8</a></sup>.
 In 1814 the <em>General Hewit</em>, the <em>Three Bees</em> and the
 <em>Surrey</em> arrived with a terrible record of illness. On the
 <em>Surrey</em> 50 people had died of preventable disease, including the
 captain. Redfern's report <em>Medical Aspects of Convict Transportation</em>,
 published in 1814, was a model of its kind, impressing the authorities in
 England, and laying the foundations of public health in Australia. He covered
 five main topics&#x02014;fresh air, clothing, diet, cleanliness and medical
 health. He recommended that, instead of men chosen by the shipowner,
 well-trained naval surgeons should be appointed, who could also act as
 government agents to oversee conditions on board. With implementation of his
 ideas, deaths were reduced by
 three-quarters<sup><a href="#ref3" class="cite-reflink">3</a></sup>.</p><p>Macquarie was appalled at the Dawes Point Hospital, which he described as
 in a &#x02018;ruinous state and very unfit for the reception of the
 sick&#x02019;<sup><a href="#ref6" class="cite-reflink">6</a></sup>.
 Without reference to the Colonial Office he financed the building of a new
 hospital by making the contractors sole importers of 45 000 (later 60 000)
 gallons of spirits for three years. This also allowed the Governor to exert
 some control over the importation of rum. Illegally imported spirit, which was
 used as barter in the colony, had caused great concern to the British
 Government, which had asked Macquarie to attempt some regularization of
 imports. After many delays the new building finally opened in May
 1817<sup><a href="#ref8" class="cite-reflink">8</a></sup> and became
 known as the Rum
 Hospital<sup><a href="#ref9" class="cite-reflink">9</a></sup>. Redfern,
 as its medical officer, lived in one of the detached staff wings, while the
 colony's Principal Surgeon, D'Arcy Wentworth, lived in the other. The Rum
 Hospital was replaced by Sydney Hospital in 1894.</p><p>Bitterly disappointed not to be chosen to replace D'Arcy Wentworth in 1818,
 Redfern decided to relinquish medicine and turn his attention to farming. He
 introduced merino sheep from Madeira in 1824, and was to play a leading part
 in the growth of Australia's wool
 industry<sup><a href="#ref5" class="cite-reflink">5</a></sup>. He also
 brought back vines and was the first in a long line of distinguished medical
 vignerons. He was a founder and director of the Bank of New South Wales and,
 as a spokesman for less fortunate emancipists on a trip to Britain, he
 achieved the granting of equal rights. With the eventual end of transportation
 the term emancipist ceased to be used. Redfern died in Edinburgh in 1833,
 where he was supervising the education of his young son William.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id121745" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">WILLIAM REDFERN</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>D'ARCY WENTWORTH</a></div><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id122094" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">WILLIAM BLAND</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id558009" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id122015">D'ARCY WENTWORTH</div><div class="section-content"><p>D'Arcy Wentworth was born in Northern Ireland, son of an unsuccessful
 barrister with aristocratic connections. Service with the Irish Volunteers,
 whose young men came from very different social backgrounds, instilled liberal
 views which he held throughout later
 life<sup><a href="#ref7" class="cite-reflink">7</a></sup>. While
 pursuing medical studies in London he mingled with members of high society and
 was soon living beyond his means. Attempts at highway robbery resulted in
 three charges, on two of which he was found not guilty. On the third he was
 acquitted for lack of evidence, though the victim, a distinguished man,
 claimed to recognize him. He was advised to leave the country and go to Botany
 Bay as assistant surgeon on a convict fleet. After four years working in
 Norfolk Island, where his skills were recognized, he took a post in Sydney.
 Putting his youthful exuberance behind him, he inspired increasing respect,
 particularly after the arrival of Lachlan Macquarie who appointed him Chief of
 Police and Treasurer of the Police Fund, describing him as &#x02018;a man on
 whose rectitude of conduct and zealous attention to his duties I could safely
 rely&#x02019;<sup><a href="#ref10" class="cite-reflink">10</a></sup>.</p><p>In 1809 Wentworth was appointed Principal Surgeon, a post he held for nine
 years. As one of the contractors of the Rum Hospital, and through other
 business deals, he acquired very considerable wealth, though he was probably
 one of many entrepreneurs in the fast-growing
 town<sup><a href="#ref1" class="cite-reflink">1</a></sup>. With William
 Redfern he was a founder of the Bank of New South Wales and became one of its
 largest original shareholders. Despite his success D'Arcy Wentworth always
 retained his humanity and, remembering his own past, gave constant support to
 emancipists, thus incurring criticism from the exclusives.</p><p>Little is known of D'Arcy Wentworth's medicine apart from a necropsy he
 conducted in 1813 on a man who had been attacked by two drunk young officers.
 Wentworth recorded no visible marks on the body and, in view of this, was
 surprised at the violence of the attack, though others claimed to have seen
 similar cases. He found &#x02018;a very considerable effusion of blood in both
 lobes of the lungs&#x02019;. Death was attributed to &#x02018;spasm of the heart
 occasioned by violent agitation&#x02019;, and Wentworth was commended for his
 careful and detailed
 evidence<sup><a href="#ref11" class="cite-reflink">11</a></sup>. D'Arcy
 Wentworth died at his property &#x02018;Homebush&#x02019; in 1827, leaving 22 000
 acres of land to his family. He had served thirty-seven years as a government
 official, but his eldest son William Charles made an even greater
 contribution. A brilliant lawyer, he was one of the architects of
 self-government, the first Legislative Council being established in 1843. By
 the early 1830s free colonists had been putting pressure on Britain for some
 form of representative government. WC Wentworth led the emancipist party known
 as Botany Bay Whigs while John Macarthur headed the exclusives or Botany Bay
 Tories. In 1835 a public meeting was held and established the Australian
 Patriotic Association. This worked towards the constitution which was finally
 granted by Britain after the end of transportation on the East Coast.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id121745" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">WILLIAM REDFERN</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id122015" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">D'ARCY WENTWORTH</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>WILLIAM BLAND</a></div><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id558009" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id122094">WILLIAM BLAND</div><div class="section-content"><p>William Bland, born in London in 1789, son of a distinguished obstetrician,
 passed the examination of the College of Surgeons in 1809. He joined the Royal
 Navy where his high principles and impetuous character soon led him into
 trouble. On HMS <em>Hesper</em> bound for India, he was challenged to a duel
 after throwing a glass of water at a very unpopular purser who, Bland felt,
 had unfairly criticized another officer. Bland pleaded with the purser not to
 pursue the challenge but was forced to a confrontation with pistols, as a
 result of which Case, the purser, was wounded in the abdomen and died shortly
 afterwards. The Recorder of Bombay recommended mercy, and Bland was sentenced
 to seven years'
 transportation<sup><a href="#ref12" class="cite-reflink">12</a></sup>.</p><p>Bland arrived in Sydney in 1814 and was freed almost immediately by
 Governor Macquarie, who knew of the urgent need for qualified doctors. Bland
 worked as medical officer of the Castle Hill Asylum, and, on receiving his
 absolute pardon a year later, was examined in accordance with the regulations
 in force for all doctors wishing to work in the colony. The three examiners,
 D'Arcy Wentworth, William Redfern and Major West, considered him better
 qualified than any of
 them<sup><a href="#ref2" class="cite-reflink">2</a></sup> Bland turned
 down an official appointment in favour of private practice. At the time
 Sydney's young men amused themselves writing scurrilous verse about leading
 figures. Bland, who was critical of Macquarie's autocratic governorship, wrote
 some anonymous lines in 1818 on Macquarie's habit of attaching his name to
 geographical features and monuments. Bland was arrested, charged and spent a
 year in goal. He emerged considerably matured and decided to devote the rest
 of his life to helping the oppressed and improving the colony. Bland was
 involved with WC Wentworth and others in the foundation of the Australian
 Patriotic Association, becoming its secretary. In 1839 he published the first
 paper putting forward the colony's right to
 self-rule<sup><a href="#ref12" class="cite-reflink">12</a></sup>. He and
 Wentworth, who had deep respect for each other, were both elected to the first
 Legislative Council.</p><p>Since he enjoyed a good income as a private doctor Bland gave his time to
 several philanthropic institutions. For forty years he was honorary surgeon to
 the Benevolent Asylum, Australia's first free hospital for the sick poor.
 Bland's work there attracted international recognition when, in 1832, he
 operated on a patient with an aneurysm of the innominate artery. This was one
 of the first such operations in the world, and took place twenty years before
 anaesthesia was introduced to Australia. The patient lived for 18 days after
 surgery, and later that year Bland's detailed description of the case and the
 aneurysm needle he invented was published in <em>The
 Lancet</em><sup><a href="#ref13" class="cite-reflink">13</a></sup>. His
 other surgical procedures included cataract operations, removal of tumours and
 amputations. Unlike many surgeons at the time, Bland was known to resort to
 the knife only when he felt there was no other option.</p><p>William Bland, an eloquent speaker and writer, included subjects as varied
 as &#x02018;Dislocations&#x02019;, &#x02018;Sanitary Reform&#x02019; and &#x02018;Bites
 of Venomous snakes in Australia&#x02019; among his published work. He was very
 involved with the foundation of the Sydney Dispensary in 1826 and worked there
 for the next twenty years. The Dispensary provided the poor with treatment at
 home or as outpatients, and carried out Australia's first vaccination
 programme on over 400 children. Bland was aware of the importance of education
 to the future success of the colony. In 1830 Sydney College, which later
 became the grammar school, was founded with William Bland as president. He was
 also a generous benefactor to the Sydney Mechanics School of Arts founded
 three years later. In February 1859 the Australian Medical Association held
 its first meeting with Bland as its enthusiastic
 president<sup><a href="#ref14" class="cite-reflink">14</a></sup>.
 Despite having 87 Fellows it lasted only eleven years, and the present AMA
 grew out of a second attempt by the British Medical Association.</p><p>A man of great energy and originality of thought, Bland was responsible for
 some remarkable inventions. There had been much concern about spontaneous
 combustion in the holds of ships carrying wool. He suggested flooding the hold
 with carbon dioxide gas, and a working model was on show at the 1851 Great
 Exhibition in London. His method was successfully used in several coal mines
 in Britain<sup><a href="#ref11" class="cite-reflink">11</a></sup>.
 Another invention was his &#x02018;atmotic ship&#x02019;&#x02014;a balloon inflated
 by hydrogen gas &#x02018;for the navigation of the atmosphere&#x02019;. He foresaw
 developments in aeronautics including reduction of travel times and
 exploration of some of the world's remotest regions. William Bland died at the
 age of 79 in 1868; he saw patients to the last and eventually succumbed to the
 influenza he was treating in others. The skills, humanity and public service
 of this great patriot were recognized by a state funeral.</p><p>William Redfern, D'Arcy Wentworth and William Bland are representative of a
 group who arrived despised and disadvantaged in an alien land. In spite of
 their handicaps they not only succeeded in proving themselves to be upright
 and reliable citizens of their adopted country but also contributed enormously
 to its development. Though always sensitive to personal insults regarding
 their past, they gained great respect as the colony became established and
 achieved self-government. The exuberance that led to their transportation,
 once tempered, helped lay the foundations of one of the six colonies that
 became the Commonwealth of Australia a hundred years ago.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id121745" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">WILLIAM REDFERN</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id122015" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">D'ARCY WENTWORTH</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id122094" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">WILLIAM BLAND</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>References</a></div></div></td><td class="content-cell"><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id558009">References</div><div class="section-content"><div class="back-matter-section"><div class="ref-cit-blk" id="ref1"><div class="ref-label">1.</div><div class="ref-cit">Richards D.
