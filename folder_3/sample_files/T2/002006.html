<br>
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
        laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
        <br>
<br>
</span><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino,"Caslon", serif" class="text"><span class="bold"><strong>Section 1.</strong></span><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino,"Caslon", serif" class="text"><span class="text"> <strong>Establishment. </strong>
        There is established the President's Council on Bioethics (the &quot;Council&quot;). 
        <br>
<br>
</span><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino,"Caslon", serif" class="text"><span class="bold"><strong>Section 2. Mission</strong>.</span><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino,"Caslon", serif" class="text"><span class="text"> <br>
<br>
a. The Council shall advise the President on bioethical issues that may 
        emerge as a consequence of advances in biomedical science and technology. 
        In connection with its advisory role, the mission of the Council includes 
        the following functions: <br>
<br>
1. to undertake fundamental inquiry into the human and moral significance 
        of developments in biomedical and behavioral science and technology; <br>
2. to explore specific ethical and policy questions related to these developments; 
        <br>
3. to provide a forum for a national discussion of bioethical issues; 
        <br>
4. to facilitate a greater understanding of bioethical issues; and <br>
5. to explore possibilities for useful international collaboration on 
        bioethical issues. <br>
<br>
b. In support of its mission, the Council may study ethical issues connected 
        with specific technological activities, such as embryo and stem cell research, 
        assisted reproduction, cloning, uses of knowledge and techniques derived 
        from human genetics or the neurosciences, and end of life issues. The 
        Council may also study broader ethical and social issues not tied to a 
        specific technology, such as questions regarding the protection of human 
        subjects in research, the appropriate uses of biomedical technologies, 
        the moral implications of biomedical technologies, and the consequences 
        of limiting scientific research. <br>
<br>
c. The Council shall strive to develop a deep and comprehensive understanding 
        of the issues that it considers. In pursuit of this goal, the Council 
        shall be guided by the need to articulate fully the complex and often 
        competing moral positions on any given issue, rather than by an overriding 
        concern to find consensus. The Council may therefore choose to proceed 
        by offering a variety of views on a particular issue, rather than attempt 
        to reach a single consensus position. <br>
<br>
d. The Council shall not be responsible for the review and approval of 
        specific projects or for devising and overseeing regulations for specific 
        government agencies. <br>
<br>
e. In support of its mission, the Council may accept suggestions of issues 
        for consideration from the heads of other Government agencies and other 
        sources, as it deems appropriate. <br>
<br>
f. In establishing priorities for its activities, the Council shall consider 
        the urgency and gravity of the particular issue; the need for policy guidance 
        and public education on the particular issue; the connection of the bioethical 
        issue to the goal of Federal advancement of science and technology; and 
        the existence of another entity available to deliberate appropriately 
        on the bioethical issue. <br>
</span><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino,"Caslon", serif" class="text"><span class="bold"><br>
<strong>Section 3. Membership.</strong></span><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino,"Caslon", serif" class="text"><span class="text"> <br>
<br>
a. The Council shall be composed of not more than 18 members appointed 
        by the President from among individuals who are not officers or employees 
        of the Federal Government. The Council shall include members drawn from 
        the fields of science and medicine, law and government, philosophy and 
        theology, and other areas of the humanities and social sciences. <br>
<br>
b. The President shall designate a member of the Council to serve as Chairperson. 
        <br>
<br>
c. The term of office of a member shall be 2 years, and members shall 
        be eligible for reappointment. Members may continue to serve after the 
        expiration of their terms until the President appoints a successor. A 
        member appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve only for the unexpired 
        term of such vacancy. <br>
<br>
</span><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino,"Caslon", serif" class="text"><span class="bold"><strong>Section 4. Administration.</strong></span><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino,"Caslon", serif" class="text"><span class="text"> <br>
<br>
a. Upon the request of the Chairperson, the heads of executive departments 
        and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Council 
        with information it needs for purposes of carrying out its functions. 
        <br>
<br>
b. The Council may conduct inquiries, hold hearings, and establish subcommittees, 
        as necessary. <br>
<br>
c. The Council is authorized to conduct analyses and develop reports or 
        other materials. <br>
<br>
d. Members of the Council may be compensated to the extent permitted by 
        Federal law for their work on the Council. Members may be allowed travel 
        expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by 
        law for persons serving intermittently in Government service (5 U.S.C. 
        5701-5707), to the extent funds are available. <br>
<br>
e. To the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability of 
        appropriations, the Department of Health and Human Services shall provide 
        the Council with administrative support and with such funds as may be 
        necessary for the performance of the Council's functions. <br>
<br>
f. The Council shall have a staff headed by an Executive Director, who 
        shall be appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in consultation 
        with the Chairperson. To the extent permitted by law, office space, analytical 
        support, and additional staff support for the Council shall be provided 
        by the Department of Health and Human Services or other executive branch 
        departments and agencies as directed by the President. <br>
<br>
</span><span class="bold"><strong>Section 5. General Provisions.</strong></span><span class="text"> <br>
<br>
a. Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 
        App.), may apply to the Council, any functions of the President under 
        that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed 
        by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in accordance with the guidelines 
        that have been issued by the Administrator of General Services. <br>
<br>
b. The Council shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order unless 
        extended by the President prior to that date. <br>
<br>
c. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the 
        executive branch and it is not intended to create any right, benefit, 
        trust, or responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law 
        or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, 
        or any person. <br>
