HOLMBERG: Good morning. Welcome to<br />5 the 27th meeting of the Advisory Committee for<br />6 Blood Safety and Availability. In just a few<br />7 minutes we will have roll call. As you have seen<br />8 the agenda for this meeting, we have purposely<br />9 dedicated a lot of time for deliberation, for<br />10 discussion. We have had many speakers over the<br />11 last couple of times and I think it is time that we<br />12 sit down and just really deliberate on some of<br />13 those discussions.<br />14 First of all, I want to introduce<br />15 everyone--probably she doesn't need any<br />16 introduction--but Dr. Pearl Toy is with us today.<br />17 She is a new member of the committee. She could<br />18 not be at the spring meeting, and we are pleased to<br />19 have you with us. Very good.<br />20 Now if I can go through the roll call,<br />21 Judy Angelbeck?<br />22 DR.

On an annual basis we do a review of<br />18 the conflict of interest from each one of the<br />19 committee members for the special government<br />20 employees. However, I would recommend and advise<br />21 that any person that speaks at the microphone, if<br />22 there is a potential conflict of interest, I would<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (7 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />8<br />1 appreciate you declaring that and also stating your<br />2 affiliation.<br />3 The minutes of the last meeting have been<br />4 posted on the web site. I have already introduced<br />5 the new committee member, Dr. Pearl Toy. Also to<br />6 let you know, I know that we have had a lot of<br />7 discussion about the membership and the change in<br />8 membership effective at the end of this meeting.<br />9 Once again, I do want to remind the people that<br />10 will be rotating off the committee that if the<br />11 bureaucracy does not move as fast as we would like<br />12 it to move, we do have, according to our charter,<br />13 the opportunity to ask you to return for the next<br />14 time until we can get a replacement for your<br />15 position. Once, again, our meeting will be in<br />16 January, our next meeting after this, and we will<br />17 reconfirm those dates at the end of the meeting<br />18 tomorrow. But if, for some reason, you get a phone<br />19 call from us, we may ask you to come back. I will<br />20 turn the meeting over to Dr. Brecher.<br />21 Chairman's Comments<br />22 DR. BRECHER: I would like to welcome<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (8 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />9<br />1 everybody to the meeting. I am just going to<br />2 quickly review the recommendations from the last<br />3 meeting. When we last met, May 16-17, we<br />4 considered three topics. The first was strategic<br />5 actions for emerging infectious disease to reduce<br />6 the risk of transfusion-transmitted disease and its<br />7 impact on availability. The second was an update<br />8 on current status of bacterial detection methods as<br />9 a release platelet concentrate procedure. The<br />10 third was an update on current issues, including<br />11 access and availability to IGIV products.<br />12 Taking them one at a time, in terms of the<br />13 strategic actions, the committee decided that<br />14 numerous questions surrounding that needed to be<br />15 resolved prior to making a specific recommendation<br />16 and the issue was tabled until this meeting. So,<br />17 we will hear a lot more about this.<br />18 In terms of bacterial detection, the<br />19 discussion on the FDA position to require bacterial<br />20 testing as release criteria--we thought that there<br />21 was no recommendation needed and the manufacturers<br />22 of various platelet collection systems presented<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (9 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />10<br />1 their approach to FDA-required testing and<br />2 postmarket surveillance. Actually, that is moving<br />3 along nicely I think right now. Actually, the New<br />4 York Blood Center will be the first to go live with<br />5 seven-day platelets next week.<br />6 An update on current issues, including<br />7 access and availability to IGIV products, was the<br />8 third topic. The committee found that, one, since<br />9 our prior recommendation of January, 2005 there was<br />10 a worsening crisis in availability of access to<br />11 IGIV products that is affecting and placing<br />12 patients' lives at risk, e.g., patients with<br />13 immunodeficiency.<br />14 Two, changes in reimbursement of IGIV<br />15 products under MMA since January, 2005 have<br />16 resulted in shortfalls in reimbursement of IGIV<br />17 products and their administration.<br />18 Three, immediate interventions are needed<br />19 to protect patients' lives and health, the<br />20 committee, therefore, urged the Secretary to, one,<br />21 declare a public health emergency so as to enable<br />22 CMS to apply alternative mechanisms for<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (10 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />11<br />1 determination of the reimbursement schedule for<br />2 IGIV products and, two, otherwise to assist CMS to<br />3 identify effectively short- and long-term solutions<br />4 to the problem of unavailability of and access to<br />5 IGIV products in those settings.<br />6 The Acting Assistant Secretary for Health,<br />7 Dr. Beato, responded to those recommendations on<br />8 August 8. Clearly, you cannot read that letter but<br />9 she thanked us for the letter. She was encouraged<br />10 by the progress reports on standardization of<br />11 protocols for detection of bacterial contamination<br />12 and the extension of platelet product dating. She<br />13 said this is an excellent example of the private<br />14 sector and the Department working together to<br />15 increase product safety and efficacy. The<br />16 committee's continued evaluation of strategies for<br />17 vigilant detection and management of emerging or<br />18 reemerging infectious diseases is a necessary first<br />19 step toward the goal of reducing the risk of<br />20 transfusion-transmitted diseases. The work has<br />21 potential impacts on blood and blood products, as<br />22 well as other vital products such as bone marrow,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (11 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />12<br />1 progenitor cells, tissues and organs. Please<br />2 continue your discussions and deliberations on this<br />3 important issue.<br />4 In terms of IGIV, she wrote that we--being<br />5 HHS--have investigated the current status of IGIV<br />6 highlighted in your comments. After extensive<br />7 discussions, we have concluded that at this time<br />8 there are sufficient supplies available to<br />9 patients. However, there do appear to be ongoing<br />10 marketplace adjustments related to how<br />11 manufacturers and distributors are managing their<br />12 respective inventories and we will continue to<br />13 monitor the situation. Our examination of the<br />14 allocation process indicates that physicians and<br />15 providers might best serve the patients by<br />16 communicating supply needs directly to<br />17 manufacturers and distributors. Review of the<br />18 current utilization of IGIV also indicates that<br />19 there is increased use of this product for<br />20 off-label use that may also be increasing pressure<br />21 on supplies. Therefore, we believe that physicians<br />22 should ensure that priority be given to IGIV<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (12 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />13<br />1 treatment for FDA-labeled uses in those diseases or<br />2 clinical conditions that have been shown to benefit<br />3 from IGIV based on evidence of safety and efficacy.<br />4 While HHS has no control over the prices<br />5 manufacturers or supply distributors may charge,<br />6 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,<br />7 CMS, will continue to monitor the average sales<br />8 price on a timely basis, as mandated by Congress,<br />9 to ensure that the reimbursement reflects 106<br />10 percent of manufacturers' average sales price.<br />11 She then wrote that she was encouraged by<br />12 the price reports on standardization of protocols<br />13 for detection of bacterial contamination--we<br />14 already went through that one. Then, she wished to<br />15 express her appreciation to the committee.<br />16 A few days after that letter, on the web<br />17 site of this committee a status of immune globulin<br />18 intravenous IGIV products was posted, and we are<br />19 going to hear more about this from Dr. Holmberg in<br />20 a little bit. Basically, the position that was<br />21 presented in the letter was reiterated and there<br />22 was a section at the bottom that spoke to where to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (13 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />14<br />1 report acute problems to the FDA.<br />2 So, we are now going to move on to the<br />3 rest of our agenda. We will fist hear about<br />4 varicella zoster immune globulin, VZIG, from Dr.<br />5 Dorothy Scott, from the FDA.<br />6 Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG)<br />7 DR. SCOTT: Good morning. I am just going<br />8 to give you a brief update on the availability of<br />9 varicella zoster immune globulin. I think this is<br />10 a new topic for this committee and we do have a<br />11 potential problem with shortage of this product.<br />12 Just a very brief background on VZIG--<br />13 DR. HAAS: Dr. Scott, excuse me for a<br />14 second. That mike is not at all clear. We are not<br />15 hearing well.<br />16 DR. SCOTT: Is that better? Can you hear<br />17 me better? Not really? How is this? Better?<br />18 Well, starting back again, I will give you<br />19 a brief update on this product, varicella zoster<br />20 immune globulin. It was licensed in 1981. It is<br />21 an intramuscular preparation that is made from<br />22 selected high anti-varicella zoster virus plasma<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (14 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />15<br />1 units from normal donors. The indications for this<br />2 are prevention and modification of severe varicella<br />3 disease. This includes pneumonia, hepatitis,<br />4 encephalitis and mortality. The people who are<br />5 predisposed to this, and for whom this product is<br />6 indicated, are immune compromised children and<br />7 adults, premature infants, infants less than one<br />8 year of age because they are at greater risk of<br />9 severe disease, and selected non-immune pregnant<br />10 women and healthy adults that have never had<br />11 varicella, again, because they are at greater risk<br />12 of severe complications. It should be administered<br />13 within 96 hours of exposure to varicella. I didn't<br />14 mention that varicella is really chicken pox. It<br />15 also causes shingles.<br />16 We have only had one manufacturer of this<br />17 product, Massachusetts Public Health Biological<br />18 Laboratories. They are scheduled to close their<br />19 plasma fractionation facility and they are not<br />20 making anymore VZIG. They have a number of other<br />21 products. We are also working with them on these<br />22 other products to provide supply through other<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (15 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />16<br />1 companies.<br />2 The VZIG supply that we have, based on<br />3 usage in the past several years, is anticipated to<br />4 last until 2006. The approximate number of vials<br />5 per year that are used are 10,000 of the smaller<br />6 vial, so larger size for adults which is 625 units.<br />7 It is a weight-based dosing scheme so 10,000 vials<br />8 treat, at a minimum, 2000 adults or 10,000 of the<br />9 smallest patients, and that would be 10 kg or less.<br />10 What have we done so far? We have<br />11 encouraged new INDs and BLA submissions for VZIG.<br />12 There are several companies not licensed in the<br />13 U.S. that make this product already. We defined a<br />14 path to licensure, or at least discussed it at the<br />15 Blood Products Advisory Committee meeting on July<br />16 21 of 2005. I will go into that in just a moment.<br />17 We are monitoring the supply. Fortunately, there<br />18 is only one distributor so that is easy to do, and<br />19 they are familiar with shortages of other products.<br />20 We are in communication with CDC to look at other<br />21 options and to help them make decisions about VZIG<br />22 and IGIV usage in substitution and we have a public<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (16 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />17<br />1 communication effort.<br />2 Very briefly, these are the Blood Products<br />3 Advisory Committee meeting questions. We asked<br />4 them to discuss what laboratory and clinical data<br />5 would be sufficient to demonstrate efficacy of a<br />6 new product. The subset questions are which target<br />7 populations would be most informative to study? I<br />8 think I have shown you that there are a number of<br />9 indications for this in different patient<br />10 populations. What surrogate markers might be<br />11 appropriate for assessment of efficacy? We also<br />12 asked for other considerations about how to do a<br />13 clinical trial for licensure. In addition, we<br />14 asked them to comment on whether the available data<br />15 support use of IGIV or acyclovir as a substitute<br />16 for VZIG for prophylaxis against severe infection.<br />17 This is the outcome of their discussion.<br />18 The target populations are only present in low<br />19 numbers because there are not a lot of susceptible<br />20 people anymore due to childhood vaccination against<br />21 varicella with the vaccine. It is also difficult,<br />22 therefore, to study this in a short time frame due<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (17 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />18<br />1 to the variety of clinical situations but small<br />2 numbers of any particular kind of subject.<br />3 They discussed the use of surrogate<br />4 markers for licensure, and the committee agreed<br />5 that a PK equivalence in normal subjects compared<br />6 with the licensed product, combined with a<br />7 laboratory demonstration of equivalence compared to<br />8 the licensed product, would be sufficient for<br />9 licensure under a surrogate marker strategy. And,<br />10 this comes with a Phase 4 commitment to further<br />11 study for its efficacy and validation of the<br />12 surrogate marker. A surrogate marker, for example,<br />13 would be anti-varicella zoster titers in people who<br />14 received this product.<br />15 The other question was could IGIV<br />16 substitute. Obviously, people are being vaccinated<br />17 and there are still plenty of donors that have been<br />18 naturally infectsed So, what are the titers<br />19 against varicella in IGIV? We were able to help<br />20 CDC look at this, and it looks as if they are<br />21 somewhere around 4-8-fold lower than what is seen<br />22 in the licensed product. But from lot-to-lot there<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (18 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />19<br />1 is no particular titer tested for any of the immune<br />2 globulin products. That makes sense because they<br />3 don't carry this indication. However, there is<br />4 variation between manufacturers and among lots<br />5 within the same manufacturer so it would be<br />6 difficult to give IGIV as a substitute unless you<br />7 knew the titer and could give the right dose.<br />8 In addition, titers of IGIV in general may<br />9 diminish as vaccinated donors replace naturally<br />10 infected donors. The titers in general in<br />11 vaccinated people are lower than they are in people<br />12 who are naturally infected.<br />13 The other question was could acyclovir<br />14 just be a substitute for prophylaxis of severe<br />15 disease? There is not sufficient efficacy evidence<br />16 for this particular indication with acyclovir. It<br />17 may be helpful, but it appears to be more helpful<br />18 in later stages of the disease, whereas VZIG is<br />19 expected to prevent the viremia in these patients.<br />20 These were the speakers we had from<br />21 Massachusetts come to speak about the VZIG<br />22 manufacture or potency testing and the current<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (19 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />20<br />1 supply status. Dr. LaRussa came and talked about<br />2 the disease correlates of protection and the<br />3 different options of post-exposure prophylaxis and<br />4 antivirals in immune globulin. CDC also provided a<br />5 speaker, Mona Marin, who talked about the<br />6 recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis of<br />7 severe varicella. In addition, we had a special<br />8 member of the committee, Jane Seaward, also from<br />9 CDC.<br />10 So, what is the current situation? We do<br />11 have ongoing supply monitoring. We are in<br />12 communication with the distributor, FFF Enterprises<br />13 and Massachusetts. We believe we have enough<br />14 supply to last at least through January. We are<br />15 requesting that only people who need this product<br />16 order it. It can be shipped right away and arrive<br />17 within 24 hours. In other words, of those 10,000<br />18 vials that were used last year, it seems that<br />19 people believe that a lot of that sat around in<br />20 pharmacy inventories and was never used. So, it is<br />21 important to get this product to people who need it<br />22 and not to have it sitting around outdating in<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (20 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />21<br />1 somebody's inventory.<br />2 FFF Enterprises has agreed to do this,<br />3 that is, to inquire whether or not the product is<br />4 needed for a specific patient in order to ship.<br />5 This was their decision but it seems like a wise<br />6 choice from the standpoint of preserving supply as<br />7 long as possible.<br />8 We have agreed to review INDs and BLA<br />9 submissions. I would note that this product would<br />10 be eligible for orphan drug classification. There<br />11 is a very small number of people that need this in<br />12 the U.S. relative to regular IGIV. They would be<br />13 eligible to request cost recovery for an IND<br />14 product and we will consider treatment protocols.<br />15 In other words, we want to get a product to people<br />16 before January, a new product, and one of the ways<br />17 to do that, even if the license is not yet<br />18 approved, is to have a treatment protocol under an<br />19 IND.<br />20 We also have a web site posting planned.<br />21 We expect it will be up this week, and this will<br />22 tell everybody about the licensed uses; request<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (21 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />22<br />1 them to only use it for specific patients and not<br />2 to order for inventory; and give the information on<br />3 how to obtain VZIG.<br />4 Clinicians and pharmacies should only<br />5 order for identified patients. This product can be<br />6 ordered from FFF Enterprises at this number, and it<br />7 can be delivered quickly. FFF Enterprises is also<br />8 keeping track of which hospitals they have sent<br />9 inventory to in the past, which gives us the<br />10 potential for hospital-hospital transfer of VZIG if<br />11 needed. In other words, there is some product out<br />12 there. It has already been shipped and there is<br />13 probably a way to move it around. They have agreed<br />14 to track this.<br />15 So, thank you for your attention and I<br />16 will take any questions.<br />17 DR. BRECHER: Art?<br />18 DR. BRACEY: Yes, I had a question in<br />19 terms of the amount of product that may be outdated<br />20 and, therefore, gone to waste. It strikes me that<br />21 in terms of the need for resource sharing I think<br />22 one option, of course, is the option that you<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (22 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />23<br />1 presented, but the regional blood centers are<br />2 pretty good resources for sharing inventories and I<br />3 wonder if you, all, had given that some thought in<br />4 terms of making these regional blood centers<br />5 depositories of product.<br />6 DR. SCOTT: That is a very good point I<br />7 think and maybe we should talk about it a little<br />8 more afterwards because I am not sure I understand<br />9 what would be involved. But FFF right now is the<br />10 sole repository and they do have a very rapid<br />11 shipping plan for this and for other products.<br />12 They have worked on shortages before. But I think<br />13 we should consider all options and I would like to<br />14 discuss that further.<br />15 DR. BRECHER: Jay?<br />16 DR. EPSTEIN: Thank you for the update.<br />17 Another issue on which we have been getting inquiry<br />18 is whether it is reasonable for pharmacies to<br />19 aliquot smaller quantities from these larger vials<br />20 since really only the adult size vials are<br />21 available. Do we have any opinions about the<br />22 safety of that practice, and can it be frozen after<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (23 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />24<br />1 it is aliquot'd?<br />2 DR. SCOTT: Right. Thanks, Jay. I should<br />3 have mentioned that there are only 625 unit vials<br />4 left, which is the dose for an adult. The doses<br />5 for children come in 125 and you give 1-4 of those<br />6 to a child depending on its weight. We think that<br />7 it is reasonable to consider aliquot-ing the<br />8 correct dosage amount if you receive this product<br />9 for a child. The other question was about freezing<br />10 of the material.<br />11 DR. EPSTEIN: Well, if you aliquot it,<br />12 then there is always the risk of breaking<br />13 sterility.<br />14 DR. SCOTT: That is right.<br />15 DR. EPSTEIN: Which is the question of<br />16 whether you should freeze the aliquots.<br />17 DR. SCOTT: I think it is a good question,<br />18 but we tend to hesitate when it comes to<br />19 manipulating a product that way and it is supposed<br />20 to be used within a certain period of<br />21 reconstitution.<br />22 DR. BRECHER: Is there any way to extend<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (24 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />25<br />1 the outdate? Is it stored liquid or is it frozen<br />2 normally?<br />3 DR. SCOTT: It is not frozen. It is 2-8<br />4 storage and, actually, I don't think the outdate<br />5 will be a problem because we expect to run out of<br />6 this before the outdate. But is there a way to<br />7 extend the outdates in general? Absolutely there<br />8 is. We just need a submission and the data on<br />9 potency and other aspects of the product. It is<br />10 not difficult to do at all.<br />11 DR. BRECHER: Celso?<br />12 DR. BIANCO: Thank you for the update. Is<br />13 there hope to have companies approach FDA that<br />14 could replace the Massachusetts Lab?<br />15 DR. SCOTT: We have two companies that<br />16 have approached FDA and expressed interest, and we<br />17 are working hard with these companies so that we<br />18 can have product provided before we run out of it.<br />19 DR. BRECHER: If there are no further<br />20 comments or questions, thank you, Dr. Scott. We<br />21 are now going to move to an update on IGIV supply<br />22 and reimbursement. First we will hear from DHHS,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (25 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />26<br />1 Dr. Holmberg.<br />2 Update on IGIV Supply and Reimbursement<br />3 Update from DHHS<br />4 DR. HOLMBERG: Well, part of my update was<br />5 to go through some of the recommendations but this<br />6 has already been done by Dr. Brecher. You have the<br />7 committee recommendations from the last time, and<br />8 from the recommendations that were put forward I<br />9 have to say that the Secretary and the various<br />10 agencies such as CMS were very concerned about the<br />11 recommendations and how do we move forward with<br />12 these recommendations.<br />13 What we did shortly after the<br />14 recommendations were received, we did have<br />15 discussion with the distributors. We talked not<br />16 only at the distributors but we also talked to the<br />17 manufacturers. We have had discussions with the<br />18 Plasma Protein Therapeutic Association, CMS, Immune<br />19 Deficiency Foundation, various providers and the<br />20 pharmacist groups and, of course, patients.<br />21 The providers indicated difficulty in<br />22 obtaining specific brands of IGIV for some<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (26 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />27<br />1 patients. This is not only for the privately<br />2 insured but also the Medicare. A lot of the<br />3 concerns that came from the providers was the fact<br />4 that rates that were set by Medicare were quickly<br />5 accepted by the other insurers and that this was<br />6 having a great impact on the location of where the<br />7 product was being infused.<br />8 The shift in treatment location, of<br />9 course, followed. We saw that very quickly after<br />10 January 1, and the pharmacists were the first--I<br />11 should say the healthcare providers--to really feel<br />12 the effects of this. Once the physicians moved the<br />13 patients over to the hospital outpatient setting,<br />14 the hospitals that did not have an allocation or<br />15 had a lower allocation than in previous years were<br />16 starting to really scramble to try to get their<br />17 product. Hospitals have reported difficulty in<br />18 obtaining physician IGIV product of choice for the<br />19 patient and we have followed up on many, many of<br />20 those calls and comments. There is an upward trend<br />21 in the price, most notably in the secondary market.<br />22 Some of the findings that we uncovered<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (27 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />28<br />1 were that there was an increase in off-label use of<br />2 IGIV. This was as a result of our discussion with<br />3 the industry. We came to the realization that<br />4 there was a consolidation of the market; that there<br />5 are now five manufacturers. The American Red Cross<br />6 is shortly going to be removing itself from the<br />7 business. Change in business practices was that<br />8 companies had decided that they did not need to<br />9 keep a large inventory on the shelf and that they<br />10 could meet the needs with a shorter inventory.<br />11 This shorter inventory then had direct impact on<br />12 the distributors' quantity. So, there was an<br />13 overall reduction in inventory, smaller numbers to<br />14 the distributors.<br />15 As I already mentioned, the MMA, effective<br />16 January, 2005, changed the Medicare Part B to 106<br />17 percent of the manufacturer's average sales price.<br />18 I stress that that is the manufacturer's average<br />19 sales price plus 6 percent. That does not take<br />20 into consideration what the distributor adds on.<br />21 So, my understanding in investigating this is that<br />22 the 6 percent is for the physician storage and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (28 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />29<br />1 maintenance of the product. We also have seen that<br />2 the Medicare payment rate is updated quarterly and<br />3 that there was an increased nine percent for<br />4 lyophilized IGIV in July of 2005.<br />5 What we also uncovered was that there were<br />6 sufficient supplies of IGIV for patients who needed<br />7 the treatment. From our discussions with the<br />8 manufacturers we also came to the conclusion that<br />9 it was under the manufacturers' allocation process<br />10 that sometimes there were shortages at the<br />11 hospitals and that the physician would do best in<br />12 communicating that supply need directly to the<br />13 manufacturer. If there was an emergency need, the<br />14 manufacturers were very willing to establish an<br />15 emergency supply.<br />16 I know that PPTA is going to be talking in<br />17 a few minutes. I will let them talk a little bit<br />18 more about that, but with my colleagues in the Food<br />19 and Drug Administration, Dr. Weinstein and Dr.<br />20 Nippon, we did contact the manufacturers. We<br />21 talked to many of the executives at the<br />22 manufacturers for the fractionators and discussed<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (29 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />30<br />1 some of the concerns out there that we were hearing<br />2 and seeing, and one of the things that we stressed<br />3 upon them was a need for an emergency inventory<br />4 supply being available for patients that truly<br />5 needed it.<br />6 We also found with the pharmacy groups<br />7 that to ensure that IGIV treatment was prioritized<br />8 correctly many pharmacies have established a<br />9 prescription review, and they prioritize towards<br />10 the FDA-labeled use in those diseases or clinical<br />11 conditions that have been shown to benefit from<br />12 IGIV based on evidence of safety and efficacy.<br />13 One of the things that I can mention here<br />14 is that there is only a handful of labeled<br />15 indications for use and, yet, the CMS does<br />16 permit--I think it is 30 different clinical<br />17 entities for reimbursement of IGIV.<br />18 Some of our action plan that we did was,<br />19 as Dr. Brecher mentioned, shortly after the letter<br />20 that he received from Dr. Beato, we did post on our<br />21 web site a report of our view of the status of<br />22 IGIV. When people ask me to really talk about<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (30 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />31<br />1 this, I think that I use the phrase that maybe<br />2 somebody brought up at one of the last meetings,<br />3 "the perfect storm." I think that that was the<br />4 phrase that was coined at the advisory committee,<br />5 but it was a perfect storm in the fact that we had<br />6 a difference in supply; we had an increased demand,<br />7 and we also had a change in the reimbursement<br />8 process.<br />9 The web posting states that if there is a<br />10 report of a denial of treatment or delay of<br />11 treatment or forced reduction in dosage, we want to<br />12 hear about it. We have put in there the FDA web<br />13 site and also the 800 number. Dr. Nippon is<br />14 responsible for monitoring that and she keeps me<br />15 posted on a regular basis as far as what the status<br />16 is of the calls that have come through. CMS also<br />17 has an 800 Medicare number that they have a script<br />18 written for that they can start collecting data on,<br />19 and they have been collecting for several months<br />20 the information on any denial.<br />21 On top of that, I have to say that any<br />22 time somebody calls in with a complaint to my<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (31 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />32<br />1 office, I personally have followed up on it. It is<br />2 very interesting going back and talking to the<br />3 pharmacists, and also people at CMS have talked<br />4 directly to CEOs of different medical facilities<br />5 and have gotten care to the patients that are<br />6 needing it. So, there is merit in making sure that<br />7 the government is aware of any denial of service,<br />8 especially for Medicare patients.<br />9 As I mentioned before, I will leave it for<br />10 PPTA to discuss but the supply channel and the<br />11 emergency reserves have been identified with PPTA.<br />12 Also, each one of the manufacturers has established<br />13 a 1-800 number, a toll-free number, for the<br />14 physician that is having difficulty in obtaining<br />15 the product to talk to the medical director of the<br />16 fractionation company.<br />17 Another aspect, and this is more of a<br />18 long-term approach, is that we are seriously<br />19 looking at an evidence-based study to try to<br />20 determine what are the clinical uses of IGIV and<br />21 what are the data out there to support the clinical<br />22 use. So, that is an ongoing study that I am in<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (32 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />33<br />1 discussion about with CMS and the agency for Health<br />2 Research and Quality.<br />3 CMS has been challenged by Dr. Beato to<br />4 continue to monitor the cost. As I have mentioned,<br />5 it is monitored on a quarterly basis. Something<br />6 else that we have initiated internally is IG<br />7 assistance, Inspector General assistance, in<br />8 looking at the IGIV problem. This has been<br />9 reiterated by support by Congress. I am aware of<br />10 at least two congressmen, and I believe I<br />11 incorporated those letters in your package. I have<br />12 requested that Secretary Leavitt enlist the help of<br />13 the Inspector General. This has been one of our<br />14 long-term or our investigational approaches also.<br />15 So, that is a quick update on the status.<br />16 As I can tell you, this is the letter that Dr.<br />17 Brecher has already mentioned. This was our web<br />18 posting of the situation, the status of the IGIV.<br />19 So, if anybody has not been to our web site, I<br />20 would encourage you to go to that. We have not<br />21 posted the 1-800 numbers on the government web<br />22 site. I refer people to the PPTA web site to get<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (33 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT</p><p>34<br />1 the 1-800 numbers.<br />2 Then also, just to give you a quick<br />3 update, and maybe Dr. Bowman could probably speak<br />4 to this a little bit better than I could but, Jim,<br />5 if you would like to jump in at any point, please<br />6 feel free to. The 2006 acute hospital inpatient<br />7 payment, the final ruling is out. The date of<br />8 publication was August 12. The 2006 HOPPS proposed<br />9 rule was out July 25 and the comments were to be<br />10 back last week, on September 16. Then also, the<br />11 2006 HOPPS correction went out on August 26 and,<br />12 again, the comments to those corrections were to be<br />13 back in the middle of September.<br />14 The 2006 physician fee schedule proposed<br />15 went out on August 8 and comments are due back on<br />16 September 30, as well as the corrections that were<br />17 published on September 1.<br />18 There are also some locations where you<br />19 might want to get some more information. For the<br />20 audience, they may want to take this information<br />21 down, the web site for CMS for the providers and<br />22 also the federal registry notice. You can go to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (34 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />35<br />1 the GPO access.gov/federalregistry. If you ever<br />2 want to find a federal registry, that is a good<br />3 place to look for it. Then also, payment for Part<br />4 B drugs, there is a web site listed there also. I<br />5 believe that is in your handouts. Are there any<br />6 questions for me or for Dr. Bowman?<br />7 DR. BRECHER: Sue?<br />8 DR. ROSEFF: I have a question, Jerry.<br />9 When I read the letter that was in our packet that<br />10 you just talked about, the physicians are supposed<br />11 to directly feed back to the manufacturers. That<br />12 is recommended. Is there a mechanism to make that<br />13 easy and to track the physicians giving input to<br />14 the manufacturers?<br />15 DR. HOLMBERG: Well, from the government<br />16 side, you know, what they report back to the<br />17 manufacturer is really out of our domain. But the<br />18 800 numbers have been provided and they can call<br />19 back and talk directly to the medical directors<br />20 there. However, if there are problems, especially<br />21 with a Medicare patient, then we strongly encourage<br />22 that that gets funneled through 1-800 Medicare and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (35 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />36<br />1 that way we can keep track of it and we can<br />2 follow-up on it. The other mechanism, as I<br />3 mentioned, is the FDA and this would be both for<br />4 Medicare and privately insured people if they are<br />5 experiencing some delay in getting product. But<br />6 direct input from the manufacturers, I don't get<br />7 that unless the manufacturers offer it directly to<br />8 me.<br />9 DR. BRECHER: Merlyn?<br />10 DR. SAYERS: How much traffic did that web<br />11 site pick up that you posted?<br />12 DR. HOLMBERG: That is a good question and<br />13 I don't have the answer for that, but I have heard<br />14 a lot of people refer to it and I have referred it<br />15 to the press wanting to know a little bit more of<br />16 what is going on in the status. As I mentioned, I<br />17 have not posted the 1-800 numbers for the<br />18 manufacturers and, you know, that is probably<br />19 something that we need to do, to put that on our<br />20 web site so that there is greater dissemination of<br />21 those telephone numbers, but I have been directing<br />22 people to the PPTA.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (36 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />37<br />1 DR. BRECHER: Thank you, Jerry. Now we<br />2 can hear from the PPTA.<br />3 PPTA IGIV Summit<br />4 MS. BIRKHOFER: Thank you and good<br />5 morning. It is a pleasure to be here in Bethesda<br />6 again before the advisory committee to talk about<br />7 the reimbursement issues. The topic today is<br />8 intravenous immune globulin access. Dr. Holmberg<br />9 did an excellent job providing a summary of where<br />10 we are currently. I was asked to talk about a<br />11 summit meeting that PPTA convened on September 7.<br />12 Even though I am not an attorney, I just<br />13 want to start with a disclaimer. The summit<br />14 meeting was not intended to be a defined group that<br />15 PPTA, you know, is sanctioning as the IVIG group.<br />16 This was done rapidly, in about a ten-day period,<br />17 where PPTA went out and took a cross-sector of the<br />18 IVIG community and invited leaders from those<br />19 organizations. So, I just want to be really clear<br />20 that the summit group participants that were a<br />21 cross-section of the physicians, the consumers,<br />22 industry and distributors, was in no way meant to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (37 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />38<br />1 be perceived as the be-all and the end-all of a<br />2 defined group. It was simply a working group that<br />3 convened on an issue-specific Hospital Outpatient<br />4 Prospective Payment System, short-term, to address<br />5 the access in the hospital outpatient system. So,<br />6 I just want to really be clear on that.<br />7 Just to give you a sense of the impact of<br />8 the new proposed reimbursement in the hospital<br />9 outpatient rule, you can see there the rates as<br />10 they impact lyophilized, the powder and the liquid.<br />11 PPTA submitted comments on Friday, the 16th, and<br />12 this joint summit group also submitted comments.<br />13 As you can see, there is a short window period<br />14 between the 16th and November 1 but realistically<br />15 by mid-October CMS will begin to make decisions.<br />16 So, PPTA and interested parties are working to<br />17 impact the agency to have them focus on the need to<br />18 assure the adequacy of the rates to sustain patient<br />19 access.<br />20 Currently, we have seen the impact of the<br />21 Medicare Modernization Act's broad, sweeping<br />22 legislation. When we were here in May we focused<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (38 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />39<br />1 on the impact of that legislation in the physician<br />2 office, which is Part B. HOPPS technically is Part<br />3 B as well. But we see a switch in the Hospital<br />4 Outpatient Prospective Payment System of 83 percent<br />5 of ASP, which is currently the $80.68<br />6 reimbursement, to an ASP plus 8 percent. Again,<br />7 looking at lessons learned from the physician<br />8 office, will the ASP plus 8 percent be sufficient<br />9 to sustain patient access to care? That is really<br />10 what this discussion is all about.<br />11 We have looked at the definition of ASP<br />12 and we have tried to offer some insight into what<br />13 may be the cause of the limitations of ASP, and<br />14 there is a lag time. Currently, there is a<br />15 six-month lag time in physician office and a<br />16 nine-month lag time in the hospital outpatient. We<br />17 just had a meeting with CMS on September 15 and we<br />18 were able to clarify that they do intend to balance<br />19 or equalize that lag time, which should have a<br />20 positive impact on the calculation.<br />21 Additionally, as has been discussed, this<br />22 is a very fluid and very dynamic market. You know,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (39 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />40<br />1 prices may fluctuate. They can, and they do,<br />2 fluctuate within a six-month period and a CMS<br />3 calculated ASP may not always reflect the current<br />4 market dynamics. We have also respectfully asked<br />5 for validation or verification of the rates by a<br />6 third-party auditor simply because we see the<br />7 immediate impact these rates have on the ability of<br />8 Medicare beneficiaries to access therapy, and we<br />9 all know from previous presentations that there are<br />10 no generics; there are no alternatives; there are<br />11 no substitutes. It is not a one-size-fits-all<br />12 therapy.<br />13 So, lessons learned: We have seen that<br />14 ASP plus 6 percent and likely plus 8 percent has<br />15 restricted the physician/patient freedom of choice,<br />16 and that is really what PPTA and its member<br />17 companies are all about. PPTA member<br />18 companies--Baxter, Talecris, Octapharma, Grifols,<br />19 ZLB Behring, those are the five companies that<br />20 manufacture IVIG and Bayer is also a member. They<br />21 are currently manufacturing a recombinant factor.<br />22 But those five companies are committed to making<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (40 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />41<br />1 therapy. They are committed to making product<br />2 available. They leave the decision to the<br />3 physician and the patient and that is the sanctity<br />4 of that relationship that my member companies are<br />5 committed to preserving.<br />6 Providers currently are reporting that ASP<br />7 plus 6 percent is not a sustainable business model<br />8 and there are reported disruptions in site of<br />9 service. Marsha Boyle, from the IDF, will give you<br />10 further detail on a more current survey but there<br />11 is plenty of data from the IDF that show 67 percent<br />12 of patients receive IVIG under the physician<br />13 payment system in the physician office.<br />14 So, what has been the impact on consumers?<br />15 Who are we talking about? Let's really put a face<br />16 to Medicare beneficiaries that use IVIG. We are<br />17 talking about 7,000 human lives, 7,000 people that<br />18 need access to this life-saving therapy. There are<br />19 no alternatives. Again, 67 percent of those<br />20 receive infusions in the physician office; 32<br />21 percent receive infusions in the hospital<br />22 outpatient setting.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (41 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />42<br />1 So, when you look at consumers and what<br />2 the impact has been--my column should be aligned; I<br />3 apologize it is not--we see in 2005 a shift from<br />4 the physician office to the hospital setting, and<br />5 in 2006 we can predict a volume of<br />6 patients--migration if you will--from home care,<br />7 from physician offices, into the hospital<br />8 outpatient setting and that is an immediate problem<br />9 and the opportunity to fix it is now. Again, CMS<br />10 is in the rule-making period. They do have<br />11 discretion.<br />12 So, how can they fix it? What can be<br />13 done? PPTA, working in unison with the IVIG<br />14 community--and these proposals are not anything<br />15 that PPTA has come up with on their own. There is<br />16 a group of people that all deserve credit for these<br />17 recommendations. We recommended classifying IVIG<br />18 as a biologic response modifier. That would affect<br />19 the physician payment side. That would get it into<br />20 a higher category. Right now IVIG is classified in<br />21 a low complexity category, similar to that of<br />22 saline. Those of you on the advisory committee<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (42 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />43<br />1 that are physicians know that IVIG is a complex<br />2 therapy. Infusions need to be monitored. Expert<br />3 nurses deliver that infusion. It is a four- to<br />4 eight-hour process. There is the chance that<br />5 during an infusion there could be reactions. This<br />6 is not a low complexity drug. It is high<br />7 complexity and should be classified as a BRM. We<br />8 are working on that.<br />9 There are political hurdles. Everything<br />10 is political when it comes to this issue. The AMA<br />11 is involved. The AMA has issues with physician<br />12 payment reform if they classify IVIG as a BRM and<br />13 reduce the rate for something else. Congress has<br />14 told CMS to look at it. CMS says we can't decide<br />15 if it is a BRM unless we hear from the AMA. So, it<br />16 is this real classic game of political ping-pong.<br />17 At the same time, the imperative need is to assure<br />18 consumer, patient access. So, this back and forth<br />19 needs to stop and IVIG should be classified as a<br />20 biologic response modifier.<br />21 In addition, we are recommending that the<br />22 HCPC codes be de-bundled; that you have<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (43 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />44<br />1 product-specific reimbursement based on the NDCs,<br />2 the National Drug Codes. Some groups have said,<br />3 you know, classify IVIG as a blood product. Again,<br />4 to you experts in blood- and plasma-related issues,<br />5 it is probably very apparent to you that IVIG is a<br />6 blood product. However, there is a disconnect.<br />7 Although the FDA recognizes and regulates IVIG as a<br />8 blood product, CMS does not because they say IVIG<br />9 is so highly manufactured that the end product is<br />10 not a blood product. I think they are thinking<br />11 along the lines of platelets, red cells, more of<br />12 the pure--although albumin is a blood product.<br />13 Again, it is a little bit of a disconnect but that<br />14 is what makes this reimbursement issue fascinating<br />15 and complex.<br />16 Additionally, we have suggested that a<br />17 demonstration project be conducted--similar to what<br />18 was done for chemotherapy, done for dialysis,<br />19 renal--that would result in additional payments to<br />20 providers that participated in conducting the<br />21 survey.<br />22 CMS did take action. You know, they are<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (44 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />45<br />1 trying to solve the problem. It is a complex<br />2 problem. If any of us had the solution that was<br />3 easy maybe we wouldn't all be here talking about<br />4 IVIG on a quarterly basis. But CMS divided codes,<br />5 liquid versus lyophilized. It is not a complete<br />6 fix. That is why the industry and the IVIG<br />7 community, recognizing the distinct, unique nature<br />8 of each brand of IVIG think the better solution<br />9 would be to de-bundle entirely and to again have<br />10 the NDC-based reimbursement.<br />11 Of course, all of these recommendations we<br />12 have raised with CMS in comments; we have raised<br />13 with CMS at meetings. I know Dr. Holmberg has had<br />14 several discussions with CMS. They tell me now<br />15 they call him Jerry and they see Jerry all the<br />16 time.<br />17 The 2006 HOPPS impact on access--again, I<br />18 don't have a crystal ball. I can only look at the<br />19 experiences from the physician office and predict<br />20 it will be negative. The window of time to act is<br />21 now. Medicare is seen as a model, also Medicaid.<br />22 You know, let's not forget CMS has jurisdiction<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (45 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />46<br />1 over Medicaid. And, we know that Congress is<br />2 looking at a ten billion dollar package of savings,<br />3 reductions in Medicaid, and we know that Medicaid<br />4 will likely move to an ASP model. So, the<br />5 reverberations negatively on patient access to care<br />6 could be catastrophic.<br />7 So, we want to draw upon conclusions from<br />8 the physician office. We ask ourselves the<br />9 question, you know, can or will ASP plus 8 percent<br />10 be sufficient to sustain access to care in the<br />11 hospital outpatient settings, which is clearly not<br />12 the optimal setting for someone who is immune<br />13 compromised and it is also the setting of last<br />14 resort. As I showed you in that chart earlier, the<br />15 hospital outpatient setting will soon be<br />16 over-saturated and the question is and then what?<br />17 So, collectively PPTA convened a summit on<br />18 September 7 to come up, as I said, with a<br />19 short-term solution, issue specific, and to<br />20 immediately focus on the Hospital Outpatient<br />21 Prospective Payment System. Some major outcomes of<br />22 are that--aside from the fact that 30, 40 people<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (46 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />47<br />1 were able to sit in a room and come to consensus<br />2 and act in a unified voice, which was I think<br />3 unprecedented--there was a recommendation that<br />4 there should be an add-on for IVIG. There should<br />5 be a dampening provision applied that some<br />6 calculations with regard to ASP should be modified<br />7 to include the prompt pay discount; and that IVIG<br />8 should be classified as a biologic response<br />9 modifier.<br />10 Additionally, there is precedent for this<br />11 group recommending that there be an increased<br />12 reimbursement or an add-on for IVIG. MedPAC, the<br />13 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, recommended<br />14 25-30 percent of ASP. CMS, their own APC<br />15 committee, recommended that the 2 percent add-on<br />16 would not be sufficient and that industry data on<br />17 additional reimbursements on the pharmacy overhead<br />18 should be considered.<br />19 So, the 2006 HOPPS situation does present<br />20 an urgency and opportunity. Dr. Holmberg mentioned<br />21 PPTA's companies' commitment to access and the fact<br />22 that the companies have made manufacturer toll-free<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (47 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />48<br />1 numbers available. Manufacturers are reporting a<br />2 robust emergency supply. But, again, the<br />3 reimbursement situation is really defining the<br />4 ability for Medicare beneficiaries dependent upon<br />5 life-saving IVIG to access care. If there are any<br />6 questions I would be happy to address them.<br />7 DR. ANGELBECK: Could you just expand a<br />8 little bit for me? Your statement about providers<br />9 reporting ASP plus 6 percent is not a sustainable<br />10 business model, and even potentially at the plus 8<br />11 percent level it is questionable, is that providers<br />12 throughout the whole system? Does that include<br />13 physicians? Does that include companies? Can you<br />14 just define that a little bit more for me, please?<br />15 MS. BIRKHOFER: When I use the term<br />16 providers I am really meaning physicians and maybe<br />17 home care companies to a certain extent. But in<br />18 the Medicare settings I do know that in the<br />19 physician office that is causing a migration to the<br />20 hospital setting. The ASP plus 6 is not sufficient<br />21 to cover the cost of the drug.<br />22 DR. ANGELBECK: What about the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (48 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />49<br />1 manufacturers? Do you think that they are<br />2 beginning to look at this and wondering if it is a<br />3 sustainable business model for them for this<br />4 product?<br />5 MS. BIRKHOFER: The companies are<br />6 committed to manufacturing life-saving therapies<br />7 and, you know, we have had some consolidations,<br />8 some shifts, some changes in the market. I would<br />9 like to think that there has been an equilibrium or<br />10 a balance brought to the market but, you know, I<br />11 certainly can't predict what the future will be.<br />12 But I can say with certainty, based on our supply<br />13 data, that the companies are manufacturing to<br />14 capacity.<br />15 DR. BRECHER: Mark?<br />16 DR. SKINNER: I guess two things, I am<br />17 curious about the system where physicians are urged<br />18 to contact the manufacturers to report shortage of<br />19 use, how you see that system working and if PPTA<br />20 has any kind of aggregate information from its<br />21 members from the reports that doctors are making to<br />22 your member companies.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (49 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />50<br />1 MS. BIRKHOFER: PPTA does not interject<br />2 themselves into the relationship between the<br />3 manufacturer and the customer. These numbers were<br />4 put out there very publicly, and because it is<br />5 customer information the companies have numbers<br />6 available, not just for IVIG but for each and every<br />7 therapy that they manufacture. The situation<br />8 currently with IVIG is not any different than other<br />9 therapies, the factor, the alpha-1, and the need to<br />10 have access to care. So, we don't see a role for<br />11 PPTA as an association, for any variety of reasons,<br />12 interjecting into that customer/manufacturer<br />13 relationship.<br />14 DR. BRECHER: Jerry?<br />15 DR. HOLMBERG: Julie, I saw on your slide<br />16 that there was one comment about the NDC-based<br />17 reimbursement. Can you explain that a little bit<br />18 more?<br />19 MS. BIRKHOFER: Sure. Medicare and<br />20 Medicaid, the federal payers, have systems in<br />21 place, coding systems. They have HCPC codes,<br />22 Healthcare Common Procedure Codes; they have<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (50 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />51<br />1 Ambulatory Payment Classification codes, APCs.<br />2 Each drug, each brand, each dosage size has a<br />3 specific National Drug Code, an NDC. It is down to<br />4 the incremental level of vial sizes. That is why<br />5 we think to assure access and the adequacy of<br />6 reimbursement to have an NDA-based reimbursement,<br />7 rather than everything under one HCPC code where it<br />8 is susceptible to volume-weighted averages, and<br />9 that can impact access by brand. We know that<br />10 consumers need access to the brand that works best<br />11 for them. We would like to get it down to the very<br />12 specific NDC-based reimbursement. So, it is really<br />13 a coding issue.<br />14 DR. BRECHER: Art?<br />15 DR. BRACEY: Could you clarify one thing<br />16 for me? Has the industry looked at the actual cost<br />17 of producing the product? In other words, we know<br />18 what the sales prices are and the wholesale prices<br />19 but what does it cost actually to make the product?<br />20 MS. BIRKHOFER: Well, I can tell you that<br />21 for plasma-derived therapies such as IVIG it is a<br />22 very capital-intensive investment. It is very<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (51 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />52<br />1 costly from the raw material that is used, the<br />2 source plasma, through the manufacturing and the<br />3 fractionation process there are a series of steps.<br />4 These facilities are huge structures that require<br />5 filtration HEPA filters; the infrastructure of<br />6 employees, the range of employees that you need to<br />7 have from highly skilled down to people that keep<br />8 things absolutely clean so that you can be in a<br />9 clearance 1, air clearance 2 zone.<br />10 So, I can tell you that these therapies<br />11 are very different than traditional chemical<br />12 synthetic therapies and they are very costly to<br />13 manufacture, again, from the starting material<br />14 through the process. The regulatory environment<br />15 constantly impacts the cost and, again, there is a<br />16 good reason for that just to assure the safety and<br />17 quality of therapy. So, the companies totally<br />18 align themselves with the process of the regulatory<br />19 hurdles and thresholds and there are costs involved<br />20 with that.<br />21 Specifically, again from an association<br />22 perspective, I can't speak to price but I can tell<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (52 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />53<br />1 you that it is a costly therapy. Depending on the<br />2 weight of the person and the amount of IVIG they<br />3 need, it can be approximately a $5,000 infusion<br />4 every three weeks. And, we don't hide behind the<br />5 fact that it is costly or expensive. It saves<br />6 lives. It is necessary. And, again, the entire<br />7 process--there are reasons for these costs. It is<br />8 very, very different from manufacturing pills and<br />9 tablets.<br />10 DR. BRECHER: Jerry?<br />11 DR. HOLMBERG: Julie, I have two<br />12 questions. Let me give you the first question and<br />13 then I will come back and ask you the second<br />14 question. Back at the May meeting of the Advisory<br />15 Committee for Blood Safety and Availability there<br />16 was a web posting from the FDA on the use of<br />17 albumin. Has that influenced the demand of albumin<br />18 and improved any of the use of the product or the<br />19 quantities, and also the manufacturers' production<br />20 of this to offset the cost of some of the other<br />21 products?<br />22 MS. BIRKHOFER: Yes, the information<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (53 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />54<br />1 posted on the FDA site was helpful. I have not<br />2 seen an immediate impact but it has been<br />3 incremental, as would be expected. As you note,<br />4 the integrated product portfolio within the plasma<br />5 therapy products, the alpha-1, the albumin, the<br />6 IVIG, the plasma-derived blood clotting factor--how<br />7 much you can manufacture of one depends, you know,<br />8 on the economics of how much you can sell of the<br />9 other because there are storage costs, handling<br />10 costs. You know, you can't manufacture IVIG and<br />11 what do you do with the paste? What do you do with<br />12 the proteins that you have taken from the plasma<br />13 for the other therapies? But, clearly, the need to<br />14 have a strong albumin demand and market would<br />15 impact in a positive manner the IVIG situation.<br />16 So, we do appreciate what the FDA did and we are<br />17 hoping to see an upswing.<br />18 DR. HOLMBERG: My other question is a<br />19 question that I ask a lot of pharmacists when I<br />20 talk to them. They comment about their allocations<br />21 and most recently I heard from a pharmacist that<br />22 was responsible for two hospitals. One hospital<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (54 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />55<br />1 had a small amount of allocation; the other<br />2 hospital had zero allocation and, yet, they saw an<br />3 influx of patients in both of the hospitals. The<br />4 pharmacists are very concerned. They get the<br />5 physician banging at their door and the<br />6 complaints--and the question that I have,<br />7 especially from the infusion services, is what is<br />8 happening to the allocations? If the physician is<br />9 no longer infusing in the infusion center or in the<br />10 physician's office, what is happening to<br />11 allocation? Is it being moved over to the hospital<br />12 where it is now being infused?<br />13 MS. BIRKHOFER: Well, I do know that some<br />14 distributors, and that is really where this<br />15 question gets to, do have mechanisms in place where<br />16 the product tracks with the user. Again, I think<br />17 that is kind of a function of the market, if you<br />18 will, as to how those determinations are made.<br />19 Allocation, as we have talked about in the past, is<br />20 an effort to assure that there is sufficient<br />21 product where it needs to be and it takes into<br />22 account historical order volumes. So, currently if<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (55 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />56<br />1 a hospital or an entity has not, for their own<br />2 business practice decisions, chosen to engage in<br />3 contracts it is difficult at this time, given the<br />4 dynamics of the market, to get the therapy. But,<br />5 again, some distributors do have, from what I am<br />6 aware of, mechanisms in place where the product<br />7 tracks with the patient.<br />8 DR. BRECHER: Paul?<br />9 DR. HAAS: Julie, as a follow-up to<br />10 Jerry's first question, if there is an increased<br />11 demand for albumin I would assume that would help<br />12 spread the capital cost between albumin and IVIG.<br />13 Does that then have a lowering effect upon the IVIG<br />14 price?<br />15 MS. BIRKHOFER: I really can't comment on<br />16 what impact that would have on pricing.<br />17 DR. BRECHER: Merlyn?<br />18 DR. SAYERS: Thanks. I didn't hear all of<br />19 your talks so if I missed this, my apologies. But<br />20 do you know what proportion of the overall use of<br />21 IVIG is for off-label indications, and to what<br />22 extent that segment of the market has grown?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (56 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />57<br />1 MS. BIRKHOFER: I know those figures from<br />2 data from the Immune Deficiency Foundation and I<br />3 have ranges that anywhere from 40-60 percent of the<br />4 IVIG is for off-label use. But, as an association,<br />5 we work with the consumer groups and we work with<br />6 the users of the labeled indications so I don't<br />7 really, you know, track that.<br />8 DR. BRECHER: Thank you, Julie. We are<br />9 now going to hear from Marsha Boyle, from the<br />10 Immune Deficiency Foundation.<br />11 Immune Deficiency Foundation<br />12 MS. BOYLE: While this is being set up I<br />13 just want to thank the committee so much for paying<br />14 attention to this issue. I am the president of the<br />15 Immune Deficiency Foundation. I am a co-founder.<br />16 And, I have an adult son who is married and<br />17 healthy, working very hard, a productive member of<br />18 society because he was diagnosed early. He gets<br />19 his IVIG and his immunologist dictates how much he<br />20 should get; where he should get it; and how often<br />21 he should get it. Not reimbursement. So, this is<br />22 something necessary for every patient who requires<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (57 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />58<br />1 IVIG.<br />2 Thank you so much for acknowledging the<br />3 crisis that many Medicare patients are facing and<br />4 not being able to get IVIG. It is a life-saving<br />5 therapy, as you know. I know you took a rather<br />6 controversial position in May in recommending a<br />7 public health emergency. We know that no one likes<br />8 this terminology but, as far as I understand, it is<br />9 one of the only mechanisms to allow CMS to increase<br />10 reimbursement rates for IVIG to a purchasable rate<br />11 and to allow patients to receive the appropriate<br />12 brand at the most appropriate site of care by the<br />13 best trained professionals in the administration of<br />14 IVIG.<br />15 You are certainly not alone in this<br />16 recommendation. Over 30 members of Congress have<br />17 recently signed a letter to Secretary Leavitt that<br />18 follows your recommendation to ensure patients<br />19 receive access to IGIV in all sites of care. We<br />20 have a little packet. That letter is enclosed, if<br />21 you would like to look at it. So, thank you again.<br />22 Congressman Israel and other members of<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (58 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />59<br />1 Congress have contacted CMS about patients not<br />2 being able to receive IVIG in their physician's<br />3 office. The first response was to have the<br />4 constituents call the 1-800 Medicare or go on-line<br />5 to find another physician to administer IVIG. That<br />6 really was not a successful response. When CMS was<br />7 further pressed by continued inquiries from<br />8 senators and congressmen, CMS wrote back to members<br />9 of Congress to have patients go to hospitals. That<br />10 also is not acceptable. The problem certainly is<br />11 not getting better.<br />12 As you have heard from Julie, PPTA did<br />13 host an IVIG summit to develop recommendations to<br />14 prevent the reimbursement crisis from occurring<br />15 under the hospital outpatient setting. IDF is very<br />16 supportive of these recommendations and is proud to<br />17 be part of this group. But as we work to prevent<br />18 access to care in the hospital patient setting from<br />19 being reduced for so many patients, we must not<br />20 forget that the other important sites of care, such<br />21 as physician offices, infusion suites and home care<br />22 settings, need to be available to our patient<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (59 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT</p><p>60<br />1 population immediately.<br />2 For many of our patients these really are<br />3 the most important settings for care and for the<br />4 ability to lead healthy and productive lives.<br />5 Aside from undue stress and negative health<br />6 outcomes from being switched, in my opinion the<br />7 long-term impact of physicians not being reimbursed<br />8 to cover the cost of treating patients is that<br />9 fewer specialists will be available in the future<br />10 to provide proper diagnosis and treatment to<br />11 patients whose health depends upon early diagnosis<br />12 and state-of-the-art care.<br />13 At IDF, since January 1, we have been<br />14 getting daily phone calls about this situation, but<br />15 we wanted to quantify the impact this has had on<br />16 the community. Therefore, we did survey our<br />17 community, both physicians and patients, Medicare<br />18 patients. I personally want to thank Jerry<br />19 Holmberg who has been in touch with us regularly<br />20 and has followed up on many of the phone calls and<br />21 problems that we have seen that have been quite<br />22 upsetting, to put it mildly.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (60 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />61<br />1 First I would like to spend a couple of<br />2 slides going back to a survey that we did in 1997<br />3 that really shows the impact of IGIV on the primary<br />4 immune deficiency community. This was a national<br />5 patient survey that was a follow-up to another<br />6 survey, a survey of patients who are treated with<br />7 IVIG.<br />8 As you can see, prior to diagnosis 90<br />9 percent had unusual or repeated infections. This<br />10 is not your typical situation. As far as the<br />11 health impact before diagnosis, something like 44<br />12 percent had irreversible, permanent functional<br />13 impairment before diagnosis and the onset of<br />14 therapy. As far as the health status before<br />15 treatment, in less than 20 percent was it good to<br />16 excellent after you show the impact of<br />17 intramuscular, which certainly was an improvement,<br />18 but after being on IVIG almost 75 percent indicated<br />19 good to excellent health. I think this is<br />20 self-evident but I think at times we just need to<br />21 be reminded of the tremendous impact of this<br />22 wonderful therapy for our patients.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (61 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />62<br />1 What we did, we conducted a telephone<br />2 survey of Medicare patients. These patients had<br />3 been selected from our 2002 national patient survey<br />4 that we knew were on IGIV and also were Medicare<br />5 patients. The response rate was very good, as good<br />6 as any survey you will find conducted by the<br />7 government. Really only 9 percent declined. We<br />8 think the results are quite indicative of the<br />9 impact of this reimbursement problem. Of these<br />10 Medicaid patients, 81 percent are now on IVIG. As<br />11 you can see, their current source of health<br />12 insurance is Medicare but some certainly do have<br />13 alternate sources of health insurance.<br />14 This is a summary of several slides, but<br />15 of this patient population, patients who have any<br />16 problems with their health because of reimbursement<br />17 problems is 39 percent, so almost 40 percent of<br />18 Medicare patients surveyed. Some of the problems<br />19 include less tolerated product; lower dose; less<br />20 frequent; changed locations, 12 percent; stopped<br />21 infusions, 3 percent. We receive calls on every<br />22 one of these.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (62 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />63<br />1 This slide was a single slide kind of at<br />2 the end of many of the questions, just kind of<br />3 asked a little differently and of these, 22 percent<br />4 have had to pay more; had their doses reduced;<br />5 interval increased; switched to less preferred<br />6 brand; postponed infusions. Again, we have had<br />7 many phone calls on postponing infusions; having to<br />8 pay more. In many cases in the private pay or in<br />9 the physician office or in the home care setting,<br />10 the co-pay is not taken. In the hospital it is<br />11 always taken and we know of patients who no longer<br />12 can afford to have therapy because of that<br />13 situation.<br />14 Change in site I think is rather dramatic.<br />15 As you can see, of the people who had reported<br />16 changing site, 51 percent had been in physician<br />17 offices, with 9 percent since January 1. Then, the<br />18 other slide is the increase in hospital outpatient.<br />19 So, we know where our patients are going and what<br />20 is happening to them.<br />21 Why do they change the site of infusion?<br />22 It is pretty self-evident. We have had quite a few<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (63 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />64<br />1 verbatims but the one I like is the explanation I<br />2 got from my doctor which is that Medicare had<br />3 started not reimbursing enough to cover the<br />4 doctor's office cost. That sort of floored me<br />5 because Medicare and my insurance is paying about<br />6 $648 more than they were paying to the doctor's<br />7 office so, certainly, this is not saving money and<br />8 it is causing undue stress to the patients.<br />9 Why less frequent infusions? Now some<br />10 local carriers are dictating that trough levels be<br />11 at a certain amount--"because the hospital was<br />12 having problems with Medicare for this and they<br />13 would not treat me unless my level was below 600<br />14 and normal is 1,000. My doctor decided to extend<br />15 it to eight weeks, hoping levels would stay below<br />16 600 but I am having sinus infections," and it goes<br />17 on. Less frequent infusions--well, they are going<br />18 to get sick and now some carriers are, you know,<br />19 trying to practice medicine.<br />20 Why they were changed to a less tolerated<br />21 product, "well, because I had to change locations<br />22 because of the Medicare pricing. I also didn't<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (64 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />65<br />1 react well to the last medication at the doctor's<br />2 office which was changed due to pricing." So, you<br />3 know, when they go into the hospital, you have<br />4 heard Julie talk about the allocations. If they<br />5 can get the product, they are getting a different<br />6 product and they are having reactions.<br />7 Some of the side effects from new<br />8 products, as you can see, that were reported in the<br />9 survey are high blood pressure; rashes; headaches,<br />10 85 percent; nausea; fever; shortness of breath.<br />11 Again, this is all because they had to change<br />12 product from the one that, you know, was safe for<br />13 them and that they were used to.<br />14 Negative health effects as a result of<br />15 problems in getting IVIG, of those who had problems<br />16 which was 15 percent of all Medicare patients, 40<br />17 percent reported having negative health effects.<br />18 Some of these health effects--they went on for<br />19 pages but trying to get it down to one slide,<br />20 although I don't think many people can read this,<br />21 but the one I highlighted is, "before I went to<br />22 Criticare I went to another hospital for treatment<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (65 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />66<br />1 and they gave me the wrong kind and I had little<br />2 spots on me. I had a really bad reaction and the<br />3 doctor mentioned kidney failure." Other infections<br />4 are pneumonia, bronchial infections, stomach<br />5 infections--you know, it goes the gamut. Again,<br />6 this product is important for our patients and if<br />7 they have to delay getting it or not receiving it<br />8 their health is going to be compromised<br />9 dramatically.<br />10 Well, this is kind of scary. Who is<br />11 responsible for the problem in getting IVIG?<br />12 Forty-four percent blamed the government in one way<br />13 or another, and I don't think the government likes<br />14 to be in that position.<br />15 As far as confidence in future treatment<br />16 by experience of IGIV problems, less than half who<br />17 have had treatment experience are confident that<br />18 they will be able to get their product in the<br />19 future.<br />20 Rating of the U.S. healthcare system by<br />21 experience with IVIG problems, again, less than<br />22 half the patients who have had problems think the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (66 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />67<br />1 U.S. healthcare system is doing a good job in<br />2 getting proper treatment to the patient.<br />3 Now, these results closely reflect our<br />4 fact survey that we did earlier in a national<br />5 sample of 558 physicians who reported having<br />6 primary immune deficient patients in our 2003<br />7 physician survey. As you can see, the number of<br />8 patients treated by these physicians who responded<br />9 to our facts survey was over 4,000 primary immune<br />10 deficient patients and about 935 other patients<br />11 receiving IVIG.<br />12 As far as asking if they had significant<br />13 difficulty obtaining IVIG products for patients<br />14 because of reimbursement, 33 percent reported<br />15 having difficulty and this corresponds with the 39<br />16 percent that we reported in our patient<br />17 survey--significant difficulty in obtaining IVIG<br />18 products by number of PID patients. I think it is<br />19 no surprise. It tends to go up with the number of<br />20 patients.<br />21 Patient impact of problems because of<br />22 availability, again, these are quite reflective of<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (67 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />68<br />1 what was reported by the Medicare<br />2 patients--postponed infusions; different site of<br />3 care; interval increase; brands less preferred;<br />4 alternate therapy.<br />5 Adverse health events, 18 percent of all<br />6 doctors reported them but 43 percent of doctors had<br />7 patients with reimbursement problems and this,<br />8 again, corresponds to the patient survey with 40<br />9 percent of all patients having problems and 15<br />10 percent of all patients.<br />11 So, you know, with this survey we are<br />12 trying to give information that is not just<br />13 anecdotal. Our anecdotal stories are<br />14 heart-breaking and they are not going away. I<br />15 think you can see that the health of patients is<br />16 being needlessly compromised. Although we know it<br />17 certainly wasn't the government's intention, it is<br />18 the unacceptable outcome.<br />19 Patients should not have to die to get<br />20 attention, which has already been reported in one<br />21 case. We are certainly working within the system<br />22 to bring about change for our patients and we will<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (68 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />69<br />1 continue this effort. However, we can't do it<br />2 alone. We need your help. We need the help of<br />3 this committee. We will do whatever it takes to<br />4 get the attention of the American public that an<br />5 FDA-approved product is being denied to some<br />6 patients who have federal insurance because of<br />7 reimbursement rates. This isn't acceptable and we<br />8 all know that private payers tend to follow<br />9 Medicare rates, as does Medicaid, and that<br />10 jeopardizes even a larger percent of our very<br />11 fragile population.<br />12 So, thank you for your concern, and we<br />13 hope that you will continue working on this and<br />14 recommend solutions to ensure that our patients and<br />15 all patients who require IGIV are able to obtain it<br />16 in all sites of care and all brands. Thank you<br />17 very much, and do you have any questions?<br />18 DR. BRECHER: Marsha, I noticed from you<br />19 slides that in your survey of the doctors it<br />20 implied that 20 percent of the patients were for<br />21 other indications. What is your estimate of<br />22 off-label use?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (69 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />70<br />1 MS. BOYLE: Again, I can't say I know.<br />2 Generally, for the primary immune deficient<br />3 patients the figure is usually around 30, 34<br />4 percent. Off-label, we have heard from other<br />5 sources that it is over 50 percent or close to 50<br />6 percent. I don't think anyone really knows. We<br />7 have a sense of our population and I actually think<br />8 it is larger than what the estimates have been.<br />9 DR. BRECHER: Other questions or comments?<br />10 MS. BOYLE: Thank you very much.<br />11 DR. BRECHER: We are now going to enter<br />12 one of our public comment periods. I guess we will<br />13 first hear about the medical needs of<br />14 Katrina-affected areas, Ms. Jan Hamilton, from the<br />15 Hemophilia Federation of America.<br />16 Public Comments<br />17 Hemophilia Federation of America<br />18 MS. HAMILTON: Good morning and thank you<br />19 for the opportunity to tell you a little bit about<br />20 what is really going on in Louisiana. Some of the<br />21 comments that I am going to make, you may wonder if<br />22 that really has anything to do with healthcare and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (70 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />71<br />1 I am going to tell you that it really does because<br />2 I want you to really think as I mention each one of<br />3 these things what would really happen under these<br />4 kind of circumstances.<br />5 First of all, there are things in the 21st<br />6 century that we take for granted--a roof over our<br />7 heads; food to eat; ability to earn a living;<br />8 access to healthcare; transportation to wherever we<br />9 want to go whenever we want to do it or whenever we<br />10 need it. Up until now no one has ever experienced<br />11 the wrath of a hurricane like Katrina. I have been<br />12 in the hurricane belt virtually all of my life. I<br />13 have heard the warnings. We have all heard the<br />14 warnings. We all know how to go out and buy<br />15 batteries and do all that kind of stuff, and we<br />16 have a tendency to feel complacent about what we<br />17 know we can handle and what we can't. No one has<br />18 ever experienced anything like what Katrina brought<br />19 to the Gulf Coast. I heard Sen. Mary Landrieu say<br />20 she had been to the tsunami area and there was a<br />21 difference. With the tsunami the water came and it<br />22 left. With Katrina it came and it stayed and it<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (71 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />72<br />1 created havoc.<br />2 The reaction and response to the<br />3 hurricane--warnings were given. Evacuation--we had<br />4 a beautiful evacuation route planned. We had<br />5 widened highways. We had made contra-flow. We had<br />6 done all these kinds of things and some people<br />7 followed the advice and left early. Others had no<br />8 means of transportation. The City of New Orleans<br />9 had access to hundreds of school buses and MTA<br />10 buses. They didn't move them to higher ground.<br />11 They were under water at the time they needed to be<br />12 used for evacuation.<br />13 I have heard a lot of people say it is a<br />14 black/white issue. It is not a black/white issue.<br />15 The mayor of New Orleans is black. The fire chief<br />16 is black. The police chief is black. But 67<br />17 percent of the population is black. So, you know,<br />18 with that kind of percentage there are going to be<br />19 a lot of those people that are not able to be<br />20 reached. The problem is they didn't start soon<br />21 enough. President Bush started asking on<br />22 Wednesday before the storm for Governor Blanco to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (72 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />73<br />1 allow them to move in and start helping. She<br />2 declined until well after the storm. So, that is<br />3 part of the problem.<br />4 For the people that left on time it went<br />5 pretty well. For others that waited, the two-hour<br />6 drive as far as Lafayette turned into a 14-,<br />7 16-hour drive. People ran out of gas. The gas<br />8 stations along the way didn't have any gas because<br />9 there had been so many people that needed to take<br />10 advantage of it. They didn't take enough food or<br />11 water or even flashlight batteries with them so<br />12 that created a problem.<br />13 Again, when you think of the population of<br />14 New Orleans, and everybody says around 500,000,<br />15 that is just New Orleans. That is not St. Bernard<br />16 Parish or Plaquemine's Parish or all those other<br />17 parishes that were involved in the evacuation.<br />18 State leaders really delayed in asking for federal<br />19 help, causing all kinds of delays in assistance.<br />20 Communication didn't exist. Telephone towers were<br />21 wiped out. There were no cell phones. There was<br />22 no way to communicate. We knew and the rest of the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (73 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />74<br />1 state knew what was going on because we could watch<br />2 in on TV. The people in New Orleans couldn't watch<br />3 it on TV and many of them didn't have radios. With<br />4 communication gone, how do you even find patients?<br />5 This is a really strange story. There was<br />6 one hospital that continued to operate even long<br />7 after the hurricane had hit. Nobody knew there was<br />8 anybody in that building, treating patients.<br />9 Finally, about three days later, one of the nurses<br />10 went to the window and was just waving out the<br />11 window and finally they realized that there were<br />12 people in there. There were actually still<br />13 patients in this hospital, working on just<br />14 batteries.<br />15 Another thing that happened, and this is<br />16 not funny; it is really kind of stupid and I hate<br />17 to say this but a lot of hospitals had generator<br />18 power. Guess where the generators were--in the<br />19 basement. It makes a lot of sense, doesn't it for<br />20 a city that is as far under sea level as New<br />21 Orleans is.<br />22 I am going to use an example, a model set<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (74 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />75<br />1 up at the Cajun Dome in Lafayette. That is my home<br />2 and I do know a lot about what happened there. I<br />3 talked with all of the leaders, Lafayette Medical<br />4 Society, American Red Cross, churches, United Way,<br />5 Salvation Army, city parish government. All of<br />6 them got together and they put things into motion.<br />7 In the beginning it worked really well. The first<br />8 shelter was set up at the Cajun Dome and it was for<br />9 people. Then they realized that a lot of people<br />10 had brought their pets and, for sanitary reasons,<br />11 they couldn't allow the pets to stay there. So,<br />12 they took another facility, another arena, and set<br />13 it up for the pets and they got the SPCA involved,<br />14 all the animal care people, and everything, and<br />15 people were donating all kinds of cages, and<br />16 everything, so people could get pets over there.<br />17 Dog food was donated. Veterinarians were there.<br />18 This is very important because of the mental health<br />19 of these patients and they had lost everything,<br />20 they needed their pets with them. Some of them<br />21 even smuggled them inside their clothes on the<br />22 buses that were allowed to leave with them.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (75 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />76<br />1 Members of the medical society I am very<br />2 proud of. They were able in some way to get in<br />3 touch with the interns and residents from LSU in<br />4 Tulane that were evacuated to Lafayette and they<br />5 put them to work immediately, along with volunteers<br />6 from the parish medical society. They emptied all<br />7 of their sample closets. They got donated<br />8 supplies, compassionate care supplies from the<br />9 manufacturing companies and they set up a beautiful<br />10 triage clinic in the Cajun Dome. You can imagine<br />11 the kinds of things--infections, asthma, along with<br />12 the just day-to-day things that people deal with<br />13 like diabetes, dialyses, heart patients, cancer<br />14 patients, all these kinds of things. Then there<br />15 was a special needs center that was set up in<br />16 another facility that was right next door to a<br />17 hospital so those patients who needed even stronger<br />18 care could be treated there.<br />19 A lot of the chain pharmacies even agreed<br />20 to fill prescriptions. They would take on some of<br />21 these compassionate care products and use them to<br />22 fill prescriptions for people because they didn't<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (76 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />77<br />1 have any money. Many of them thought they were<br />2 leaving home for two or three days. It has now<br />3 been three weeks and some of them will never go<br />4 back and some of them may be able to go back at<br />5 some time or another.<br />6 The university hospital system in Tulane<br />7 lost all their records. They didn't lose them all,<br />8 they just couldn't be accessed. So, you have<br />9 patients presenting with--yes, I take this little<br />10 white pill in the morning for my blood pressure,<br />11 and then there's this little red pill that I take<br />12 for this. Oh, there's this little yellow one that<br />13 I take for this. You have no records. You have<br />14 nothing to go on by what they are telling you. The<br />15 more educated people were able to--some of them<br />16 even had their bottles of medicines on them or a<br />17 list but, sadly, the majority of them, really they<br />18 didn't know. So, these physicians were starting<br />19 from ground zero.<br />20 This is the first part where I just want<br />21 to cry. There was friction between the Red Cross<br />22 and the medical volunteers because the kind of<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (77 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />78<br />1 treatment they were giving didn't fit the protocol<br />2 of American Red Cross so they made them leave. Now<br />3 there were these thousands of patients who were<br />4 being cared for beautifully within this shelter who<br />5 are now--they have no cars and they now have to<br />6 access the emergency rooms and the walk-in clinics<br />7 to get care. It is really sad. For instance, in<br />8 our city we experienced in 15 days the growth that<br />9 any city is expected to do in 15 years. So, just<br />10 think about that, and think about the fact that<br />11 even to get a prescription filled in a pharmacy<br />12 sometimes took as much as 24-36 hours because they<br />13 just couldn't get enough of the drugs.<br />14 Our office happens to be in Lafayette. It<br />15 is right on I-10, the southern part of the state<br />16 between Mississippi and Texas, and a lot of people<br />17 came there. There were a lot of people that had<br />18 relatives there and our office is set up there.<br />19 So, we set up a conference call with clotting<br />20 factor manufacturers, along with representatives<br />21 from NHF, and we identified what to do with some of<br />22 the hemophilia patients. We identified United<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (78 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />79<br />1 Blood Services in Lafayette to house and distribute<br />2 compassionate factor. They already have an<br />3 existing system, delivery system set up and they<br />4 carried some product anyway so it was a natural<br />5 for them to do it, at no charge. And, the Gulf<br />6 States treatment center in Houston was identified<br />7 for those people there. There was also a place in<br />8 Dallas they could go and a place in San Antonio.<br />9 They could go to treatment centers there. In our<br />10 treatment center we couldn't even find Dr.<br />11 Lessinger from Tulane for a while. Then she showed<br />12 up and guess where she showed up. In Lafayette.<br />13 So, we opened our doors to her and she and her<br />14 social worker and her staff were housed in our<br />15 offices. And, we seem to have become the center<br />16 for distributing all of these goods and services<br />17 that are coming in from anywhere and we truly,<br />18 truly, truly appreciate it.<br />19 In the time that we couldn't locate Dr.<br />20 Lessinger we contacted two groups of hematologists<br />21 in Lafayette who treat patients with hemophilia,<br />22 one group at University Medical Center and another<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (79 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />80<br />1 in private practice. They agreed to do whatever<br />2 they could do for those patients within that area.<br />3 In our area the city limits are 100,000 but our<br />4 trade area is 500,000 so there were a lot of people<br />5 in the surrounding towns that were able to get care<br />6 that way.<br />7 Then on September 12 Dr. Lessinger and her<br />8 staff moved in. We gave them telephones, desks,<br />9 and so forth, and they have been set up there in<br />10 our offices. We have also set up a hemophilia<br />11 disaster relief fund for patients who have needs<br />12 other than medical. If you can just imagine trying<br />13 to start over--one day you wake up and your house<br />14 is two sticks and you have nothing. You don't have<br />15 a family picture. You have some of the pictures on<br />16 TV that showed the missing children and it is just<br />17 a little black profile. Some of them have nothing.<br />18 They had nothing when they left.<br />19 Even connecting family members separated<br />20 during the evacuation became a major problem. Ham<br />21 radio operators have been a big, big, big help but<br />22 they were also located in the Cajun Dome and the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (80 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />81<br />1 Red Cross asked them to leave because they wouldn't<br />2 allow the room that they were working out of to be<br />3 locked at night when they weren't there. If I was<br />4 a ham radio operator I wouldn't want to leave my<br />5 tens of thousands dollars worth of equipment there<br />6 either with about 10,000 people in the building.<br />7 During all this time, I guess it was about<br />8 the day after the hurricane, Rep. Bobby Jindal's<br />9 office called me and asked for input on the<br />10 healthcare needs in the face of Katrina, and they<br />11 helped put together the next phase of relief,<br />12 actually tried to cut through as much red tape as<br />13 possible. This, again, doesn't really have<br />14 anything to do with healthcare treatment and, yet,<br />15 it does because the results of not doing it do<br />16 result in healthcare, and that is the fact that<br />17 those buses sat there in New Orleans without any<br />18 drivers, the metropolitan buses and the school<br />19 buses that should have been moved to higher ground,<br />20 and the answer was that the reason they weren't<br />21 used is that they couldn't find any drivers. Well,<br />22 hello! In times of an emergency you shouldn't have<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (81 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />82<br />1 to have a CDL to be able to drive a bus to get<br />2 people to safety and drive them as far as need be.<br />3 So, this began my survey of all of the<br />4 things that we saw as obstacles. Here are some of<br />5 the obstacles: Defiance of individuals not wanting<br />6 to leave their affected areas. This was home. It<br />7 is New Orleans and it is home. The same thing with<br />8 Biloxi. There is sort of a compassionate feeling;<br />9 generations had been there.<br />10 Lack of adequate search and rescue<br />11 personnel and delay in requesting federal aid. The<br />12 delay in requesting federal aid from the state was<br />13 a big, big, big mistake and that is another place<br />14 where we feel that the red tape should be cut. I<br />15 do know that at one time President Bush was<br />16 considering evoking the Insurgency Act and maybe<br />17 there should be something that could be done to not<br />18 have to wait for a governor to come in to help in a<br />19 situation like that. In the first place, just in<br />20 an everyday situation, you don't have enough people<br />21 to be able to deal with this sort of immense<br />22 emergency. In the second place, when a lot of them<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (82 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />83<br />1 have already left you sure don't have the<br />2 facilities. So, you need help from somewhere.<br />3 There was a very slow response in our area<br />4 of the state by FEMA and the Red Cross to get the<br />5 individuals registered and get aid to the evacuees.<br />6 Not until a couple of days ago did the Red Cross<br />7 start distributing any finances to the people, and<br />8 it was $350 per person or up to $1,500 for a<br />9 five-member family.<br />10 The clothing and all of the other things<br />11 were being done by the Salvation Army and by local<br />12 organizations. FEMA was absolutely non-existent in<br />13 Lafayette. We knew that there was FEMA in Baton<br />14 Rouge. We could not find any FEMA in Lafayette.<br />15 They were in Houston. They were all over Texas but<br />16 they weren't in Lafayette where we had about 40,000<br />17 to 50,000 worth of evacuees.<br />18 Then my answer was, well, I will start<br />19 sending out e-mails to the delegation and say, you<br />20 know, find them. Where are they? And the next<br />21 day, on Sunday, I got a call from a lady in Baton<br />22 Rouge who was with FEMA and she said, well, we have<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (83 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />84<br />1 60 contract employees in Lafayette but none of them<br />2 really work for FEMA. So, there was no one that<br />3 was calling the shots. It was just a bunch of<br />4 hired help and they didn't know what to do.<br />5 There needs to be some sort of better<br />6 screening process to identify the people with<br />7 medical problems and to keep families together.<br />8 There are still children who don't know where their<br />9 mothers are, and mothers and grandmothers who don't<br />10 know where their children and grandchildren are.<br />11 Parents of hospitalized newborn babies weren't<br />12 notified where their babies were air-lifted to and<br />13 it has taken until this past week--actually, I<br />14 think there is still one baby that has not been<br />15 united with its parents. If you can imagine going<br />16 through a birth during that kind of a situation and<br />17 then having your baby taken from you and flown out<br />18 some place and you are not even told where they<br />19 are!<br />20 The evacuees were not given a choice of<br />21 which city to go to. They were just put on a bus<br />22 and sent somewhere. A lot of the families were<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (84 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />85<br />1 separated and put on different buses.<br />2 All of these things lead to mental health<br />3 issues. They may not be actual medical issues but<br />4 they are mental health issues that really create a<br />5 major problem. I just can't even imagine, you<br />6 know, losing everything you have and then not<br />7 knowing where the rest of your family is. The<br />8 special needs portions of the population, whether<br />9 it is hemophilia, diabetes, high blood pressure,<br />10 multiple sclerosis, immune deficiency, alpha-1,<br />11 whatever it is, it has a major impact upon their<br />12 condition just under normal conditions. But if you<br />13 can imagine going through this and still having<br />14 that problem!<br />15 So, what do we do next time? Make sure<br />16 that the state officials invite federal help<br />17 immediately, before the storm hits. Mayor Nagin<br />18 said that he did not really want to make the<br />19 evacuation mandatory because some of those people<br />20 had been there all their lives. But nobody had<br />21 ever seen anything like this. The levee was built<br />22 for category 3 hurricanes and nobody knew what<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (85 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />86<br />1 would happen. They should have been made<br />2 mandatory. There should be a sound plan in place<br />3 prior to onset and started at least two to three<br />4 days earlier. You know, it is better to be safe<br />5 than sorry.<br />6 Some kind of backup communication methods.<br />7 The TV stations had satellite communication. Why<br />8 couldn't that have been used by the people who were<br />9 in charge? Each vulnerable state, Atlantic Coast,<br />10 Gulf Coast, West Coast, wherever they are should<br />11 have in place a really good plan in order to be<br />12 prepared and to not face the kinds of things that<br />13 are being faced right now.<br />14 And to be sure to incorporate outside<br />15 help, be ready to incorporate outside help. For<br />16 instance, from our city there were 100 boats and<br />17 300 people that left at 4:30 one morning to go down<br />18 there to try to help evacuate the people. They got<br />19 down there and they weren't allowed to go because<br />20 they didn't have anybody to direct them where to<br />21 go.<br />22 There needs to be mass transportation<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (86 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />87<br />1 strategy for evacuation beyond the areas of the<br />2 storm's path, and I don't mean just 30 miles<br />3 outside but far enough away that it doesn't have<br />4 such a tremendous impact on the population,<br />5 especially for those that don't have access to<br />6 personal transportation, and identify in advance<br />7 medical centers outside of the storm's path to be<br />8 designated as the triage centers for the various<br />9 patient populations and have computer backup<br />10 available. Every hospital should have off-campus<br />11 backup somewhere safe, in a vault, doctors' offices<br />12 in hospitals, somewhere where that can be reached<br />13 when it needs to be.<br />14 In a recent statement released by the OMB,<br />15 they stated that proper response to disaster relief<br />16 should be unified, coordinated and effective. Boy,<br />17 that sums it up and that is what it has not been.<br />18 Some of the things that have happened--I<br />19 mentioned that I had e-mailed the delegation with<br />20 the problems and gotten responses. The first<br />21 response came back from FEMA. Then I got a call<br />22 just a few days ago from the Vice President for the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (87 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />88<br />1 Quality Assurance for the Red Cross. He said,<br />2 "I've gotten all these e-mails with your name on it<br />3 that said to call you and find out what was going<br />4 on," and I kind of let her have it about some of<br />5 the things, even the distribution of food that was<br />6 going to the outlying centers. It was being<br />7 prepared in Lafayette and taken in a U-haul truck<br />8 with no refrigeration, no heat control, very<br />9 unsanitary conditions, and that was being taken out<br />10 to the outlying centers. There you have another<br />11 health problem. What is going to happen from these<br />12 people eating food that hasn't been properly<br />13 handled from the time it was prepared? Sometimes<br />14 it was as much as three or four hours before that<br />15 food was consumed by the people in the centers.<br />16 There is still a lack of coordination<br />17 between the city officials and the federal<br />18 officials on what should be done and what is next.<br />19 Just today I heard on the news this morning that<br />20 there is a difference of opinion. The mayor really<br />21 wants to get the city back up and running.

There<br />5 is no infrastructure. The joint commission of<br />6 healthcare organizations has stated that there is<br />7 no New Orleans hospital infrastructure right now.<br />8 It is gone. It doesn't exist. There are one or<br />9 two hospitals operating but they have minimal<br />10 staff. There is no 911 situation. How do you send<br />11 a population back in to pick up and start over<br />12 again when you don't have grocery stores that are<br />13 open? You don't have pharmacies that can give<br />14 drugs? It is just not there. So, it needs to go<br />15 much, much, much slower.<br />16 There is just a lot of disappointment in<br />17 what happened. Do you remember 9/11? Do you<br />18 remember when this group got together and we talked<br />19 about what would be the actions taken if we had<br />20 another terrorist attack? Katrina was not a<br />21 terrorist attack; it was an attack by Mother<br />22 Nature. But some of those same plans could have<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (89 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />90<br />1 been put to use. We still have a lot of work to do<br />2 and I would hope that this group could be involved<br />3 in any emergency planning process for the future.<br />4 The healthcare, the access to blood and blood<br />5 products, the access to physicians, access to<br />6 hospitals is absolutely imperative in a disaster of<br />7 this type.<br />8 I know you have all been inundated where<br />9 you live with the accounts of what is happening in<br />10 that area, in the affected area. Let me tell you,<br />11 you are only seeing a microcosm of what is<br />12 happening. I also distributed to you an eyewitness<br />13 account of a friend of mine from White Charles who<br />14 went down later and was able to go in and help<br />15 rescue people and it shows you all the stumbling<br />16 blocks that even this just one person came across,<br />17 and they were with a group as well. It is sad. It<br />18 shouldn't happen. And I am hoping that if nothing<br />19 else comes out of it, in the future, the next time<br />20 North Carolina or Florida or Mississippi or<br />21 Louisiana get hit with anything close to this<br />22 immenseness, there are better plans in place to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (90 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />91<br />1 help.

JOECKEL: Lack of planning, lack of<br />10 timely response, lack of coordination--interesting,<br />11 that is what happened with Katrina and I guess what<br />12 I am here to talk to you about, and be a little bit<br />13 redundant, are the issues surrounding IVIG and<br />14 access to care. I don't have a presentation to<br />15 project, I just have the speech.

Well, we are the<br />2 distributor community and we would be happy to work<br />3 with any of you to gather any level of data that<br />4 you need to evaluate this crisis that is happening<br />5 in our industry.<br />6 We do ask for your assistance once again<br />7 in helping us convey and urgent message to CMS<br />8 about this issue related to both patient care and<br />9 quality of life. We ask that CMS reevaluate the<br />10 impact of both the Part B and the January, 2006<br />11 Medicare reimbursement changes that are related to<br />12 IVIG. It is not just the cost of the drug; it is<br />13 the cost of the services reimbursement that needs<br />14 to be reevaluated as well.<br />15 Currently, Medicare reimbursement rates<br />16 and the required infusion services have<br />17 dramatically changed the landscape of our industry<br />18 and our patient access to care. Because the<br />19 reimbursement rates by Part B do not cover the<br />20 actual costs of the drug or services physicians and<br />21 home care providers have been forced to shift<br />22 Medicare patients to the hospital outpatient<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (93 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />94<br />1 setting. I receive those calls every day. For a<br />2 long time I only received calls from providers. I<br />3 am now receiving calls--as a distributor, I receive<br />4 calls from patients and, obviously, it is a<br />5 violation of HIPPA that I even engage in those<br />6 conversations but, you know, the issue has<br />7 escalated to the level that we have the patients<br />8 themselves calling us, begging us to help them<br />9 continue to receive their care in a physician<br />10 office.<br />11 We feel that the quality of care<br />12 accessible by Medicare patients has significantly<br />13 eroded, and it is going to continue on this<br />14 downward spiral if we don't do something about it.<br />15 To make matters worse, the redirection of patients<br />16 into the hospital outpatient setting has caused<br />17 supply issues. Hospitals traditionally contract<br />18 with manufacturers for pre-established allocations<br />19 of IVIG based upon their historical demand. This<br />20 new, unplanned drain on their supplies has caused<br />21 considerable issues with access to the drug.<br />22 While we feel that some of the supply<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (94 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />95<br />1 issues will self-correct because manufacturers are<br />2 increasing their production of the drug, the<br />3 reimbursement rate deficit between what the therapy<br />4 costs versus what they are reimbursed remains an<br />5 issue. So, we feel that that redirection of<br />6 patients into the hospital outpatient setting, in<br />7 the hospital setting, is going to continue.<br />8 Infusing IVIG is a complex undertaking.<br />9 Conversations that we have with our physician<br />10 providers speak to the unplanned incidence of<br />11 life-threatening adverse events. You have to have<br />12 medical supervision throughout an infusion, and an<br />13 infusion can be, as earlier referenced, as short as<br />14 two to three hours but as long as eight hours,<br />15 depending upon the patient, depending upon the<br />16 drug. Reimbursement rates have to cover those<br />17 costs.<br />18 I know that the IDF--Marsha spoke to you<br />19 about some of the surveys that they did. I<br />20 received some information from Dr. Orange about an<br />21 IDF survey that they did of 1,070 patients as it<br />22 related to adverse events. It found that 61<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (95 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />96<br />1 percent of patients have infusion rate-related<br />2 adverse events and 44 percent have had serious<br />3 adverse events. Unfortunately, the incidence of<br />4 these adverse events is not predictable. The IDF<br />5 survey also found that 34 percent of adverse events<br />6 occurred during the first infusion with a new<br />7 product, but the remainder occurred in patients who<br />8 previously tolerated that particular brand of IGIV.<br />9 I think that speaks a little bit to Julie's point<br />10 about possibly looking at un-bundling the<br />11 reimbursement and having and NDC-specific<br />12 reimbursement rate.<br />13 But today we know that reimbursement rates<br />14 are dictating where Medicare patients receive<br />15 therapy. Patient migration from a nurse- or<br />16 physician-supervised home therapy and physician<br />17 office therapy to the hospital outpatient settings<br />18 has the potential to increase adverse event risks<br />19 to patients. Prior to the implementation of the<br />20 Medicare Modernization Act, according to IDF, about<br />21 30 percent of the PID patients relied on hospital<br />22 outpatient facilities and, you know, anywhere from<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (96 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />97<br />1 60-70 percent were actually--I think Marsha used 67<br />2 percent--were actually receiving their infusion in<br />3 a physician office. Since the implementation of<br />4 MMA, we know that that number is reportedly<br />5 increased due, at least in part, to the fact that<br />6 the cost of the drug and the services are not being<br />7 covered by reimbursement.<br />8 When you look through the primer--and I<br />9 kind of have that as an IVIG primer to talk to you<br />10 about some of the distribution and some of the<br />11 manufacturing costs--the economics of IVIG, there<br />12 are some physician testimonials in there that talk<br />13 to the point of how they, in fact, have had to stop<br />14 treating Medicare patients. Some of them are not<br />15 for-profit; some of them are for-profit physician<br />16 offices. But even the non-profit providers have<br />17 basically said they have had to use a financial<br />18 model to establish how many Medicare patients their<br />19 practice or their cost and overhead can absorb.<br />20 So, they kind of have an allocation of we can only<br />21 have X number of Medicare patients, and they have<br />22 to turn away and redirect the balance of those.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (97 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />98<br />1 We have to get the message that CMS has to<br />2 prevent the elimination or the restriction of<br />3 access to care, to all of these other sites of<br />4 care--home care, physician office inclusive. It is<br />5 our belief that CMS has the authority and<br />6 flexibility to address the existing reimbursement<br />7 problems that are going to continue to escalate,<br />8 especially if the proposed HOPPS reimbursement<br />9 rates are implemented.<br />10 We know that CMS has taken the latitude<br />11 and has worked with other industries to help carve<br />12 out their drugs to change reimbursement rates, and<br />13 we hope that IVIG is going to be able to obtain<br />14 that same latitude.<br />15 I had the unfortunate personal experience<br />16 of witnessing a patient being turned away.<br />17 Unfortunately, I was at the multiple sclerosis<br />18 research and treatment center in New York and,<br />19 basically, that particular practice had reached<br />20 their quota. This was not a PID patient. It was<br />21 an off-label indication that was being treated, but<br />22 the woman was sobbing and had basically indicated<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (98 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />99<br />1 that since she had been receiving the IVIG it meant<br />2 the difference between her being wheelchair bound<br />3 versus being able to walk, albeit with the<br />4 assistance of a walker. But that mobility was<br />5 going to be lost if she did not receive that<br />6 treatment.<br />7 I know that there has been a lot of<br />8 discussion about off-label indications. We have<br />9 been doing a little bit of a survey of our own for<br />10 some of the patients and would volunteer that we<br />11 would be happy to assist you in helping obtain some<br />12 of that data but, you know, at what point does<br />13 Medicare insurance reimbursement dictate whether a<br />14 treatment is medically necessary if it improves, in<br />15 fact, the quality of life of a patient?<br />16 All of these patients deserve treatment,<br />17 and they deserve to choose their site of care. So,<br />18 we ask once again that this committee help us<br />19 convey the sense of urgency to CMS. Thank you for<br />20 your past efforts and, again, we don't want it to<br />21 be lack of planning, lack of timely response and<br />22 lack of coordination that prevents us from<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (99 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />100<br />1 addressing this very important issue. Thank you.<br />2 Are there any questions?<br />3 DR. BRECHER: Questions? Comments?<br />4 Merlyn?<br />5 DR. SAYERS: Thanks. Can I ask you a<br />6 question about some of the information you have in<br />7 this booklet?<br />8 MS. JOECKEL: Yes.<br />9 DR. SAYERS: There really is some valuable<br />10 news here. One of the illustrations though speaks<br />11 to the expense associated with testing for<br />12 hepatitis D. What did you mean by excessive<br />13 production waste driving up the price of IVIG?<br />14 MS. JOECKEL: Well, again, I am not the<br />15 expert and this is information that we use to<br />16 illustrate the fact that we know that there has<br />17 been, for instance, with recombinant factor demand<br />18 versus plasma demand for these other products that<br />19 are made from a liter of plasma. You know, the<br />20 manufacturer has to recover those manufacturing<br />21 costs somewhere. I know there were a lot of<br />22 questions about why is the cost of IVIG continuing<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (100 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />101<br />1 to go up, and why the ASP look-back period<br />2 sometimes--you know, 90 days may not be sufficient<br />3 because the market is dynamic. It is changing and<br />4 it is changing rapidly. These are businesses after<br />5 all. They have to cover their overhead.<br />6 I happen to be a CPA who runs a sales<br />7 organization, but I understand PNLs and I<br />8 understand the fact that you have direct and<br />9 indirect costs of manufacturing. You have to be<br />10 able to cover those costs. If your byproducts or<br />11 the finished goods that you are manufacturing--and<br />12 in this case a liter of plasma and there are<br />13 multiple finished goods that are derived from that<br />14 and if all of a sudden the demand for one of those<br />15 finished goods start diminishing you have to recoup<br />16 those costs somewhere.<br />17 DR. BRECHER: If there are no other<br />18 questions or comments, thank you. Are there any<br />19 other comments from the public?<br />20 Immune Deficiency Foundation<br />21 MS. VOGEL: Hi, I am Michelle Vogel, from<br />22 the Immune Deficiency Foundation. First, I want to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (101 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />102<br />1 echo Marsha Boyle by commending this committee for<br />2 its continued support to improve access to IVIG. I<br />3 would like to underscore IDF's data on the switch<br />4 and location for treatment for patients. Prior to<br />5 January 1, 51 percent of these patients were being<br />6 treated in physicians' offices and 17 percent were<br />7 in the hospitals. Now only 9 percent are in the<br />8 physicians' offices and 49 percent are in the<br />9 hospitals. These numbers are increasing every day<br />10 because the physicians and the home care companies<br />11 that had been holding onto the patients, hoping to<br />12 see the reimbursement rates increase are not seeing<br />13 those numbers and are trying to transfer them at<br />14 this point. But hospitals at this point are<br />15 over-burdened, and either they do not have enough<br />16 IVIG, they don't have enough staff to administer<br />17 it, or the facilities or personnel aren't qualified<br />18 to administer IVIG, which is leading to waiting<br />19 periods and denial of coverage or care. This<br />20 includes the unlabeled patients and the primary<br />21 immune deficient patients. We get calls every day<br />22 that a patient is being put on waiting lists of up<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (102 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />103<br />1 to six months. They can't wait for six months to<br />2 get product.<br />3 This is under the current reimbursement<br />4 rate. When the rates drop in the hospitals--I<br />5 mean, the hospitals are being reimbursed at $80.68<br />6 and can't take care of these patients. When they<br />7 drop to match the physician's office I don't know<br />8 what is going to happen to these patients.<br />9 I know your recommendation for a public<br />10 health emergency was controversial, but I applaud<br />11 you for trying to do the right thing for patients<br />12 and make sure that they receive the life-saving<br />13 therapy and the right site of care. I think many<br />14 members of Congress have joined in your efforts,<br />15 not only with that one letter that had over 30<br />16 signatures but phone calls and individual letters<br />17 going in.<br />18 I can't tell you how many letters we are<br />19 seeing from individual patients going to CMS with<br />20 phone calls and getting feedback saying call 1-800<br />21 Medicare. Marsha said this but I have to reinforce<br />22 this. They are saying, well, if your doctor won't<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (103 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />104<br />1 treat you, find another doctor that will. There<br />2 aren't any. Saying to the members of Congress we<br />3 will have the patient go to the hospital, they<br />4 can't. There is not enough product in the<br />5 hospitals to treat these patients or there are not<br />6 enough people to administer it.<br />7 So, this is just going to escalate on<br />8 January 1. I think it is important for this<br />9 committee today to continue to show its concern<br />10 over the growing problem and the catastrophic<br />11 outcome pending if the hospital reimbursement drops<br />12 to the same rates as the non-hospital provider<br />13 settings. I know you guys have taken a lot of heat<br />14 for your recommendations. But I really, really<br />15 think it is important for you to continue, and I am<br />16 not saying coming out with another public health<br />17 emergency but making a statement showing your<br />18 growing concern that access is continuing to be an<br />19 issue and that we are going to have a serious<br />20 problem come January 1 if the HOPPS rates go<br />21 forward that Julie Birkhofer showed you on that<br />22 slide.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (104 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />105<br />1 We have proposed some solutions and the<br />2 whole group has come together with those solutions.<br />3 If CMS doesn't accept those solutions we are in<br />4 trouble. These patients are in trouble.<br />5 Therefore, I am requesting that this committee<br />6 sends a letter to Secretary Leavitt regarding your<br />7 continued concern, as well as the need to keep the<br />8 hospital reimbursement for IVIG as stable as<br />9 possible by not dropping to the level of Medicare<br />10 Part B or ASP plus 8 percent. Thank you.<br />11 DR. BRECHER: Comments? Questions? Yes?<br />12 Advanced Medical Technology Association<br />13 MS. LEE: Hi, good morning. My name is<br />14 Theresa Lee, I am with the Advanced Medical<br />15 Technology Association, representing our blood<br />16 products and technology sector. My member<br />17 companies manufacture a wide variety of blood<br />18 products that screen and process blood.<br />19 This morning's discussion on IVIG<br />20 reimbursement has highlighted, at least for me, the<br />21 significant impact that Medicare reimbursement has<br />22 on patient access and the availability of blood and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (105 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />106<br />1 blood products overall. In that vein, my members<br />2 continue to have significant concerns about overall<br />3 Medicare reimbursement for blood and blood<br />4 products, and we have been working in coalition<br />5 with the American Association of Blood Banks, the<br />6 American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers in<br />7 pursuing appropriate reimbursement for blood and<br />8 blood products.<br />9 Dr. Holmberg mentioned several recently<br />10 published Medicare payment regulations either in<br />11 proposed or final form at this juncture. I would<br />12 like to bring just three developments to your<br />13 attention in those regulations.<br />14 First, I would note that in the inpatient<br />15 final regulation the Medicare program rolled blood<br />16 and blood products, which had previously been a<br />17 separate category, into sort of a catch-all<br />18 category of miscellaneous items. Previously, you<br />19 may recall, blood and blood products had been<br />20 attached as an index to blood derivatives, and I<br />21 think some of the fluctuations in the plasma<br />22 derivatives market caused blood reimbursement to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (106 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />107<br />1 decline in that context. Now they have attached it<br />2 to a separate producer price index that is<br />3 completely unassociated with blood and the concern<br />4 is that fluctuations in that index could lead to<br />5 further cuts. I wanted to just bring it to your<br />6 attention.<br />7 It also highlights the fact that we need<br />8 to stay on top of the issues related to blood<br />9 reimbursement, particularly in the inpatient<br />10 setting where, as I understand it, over 80-90<br />11 percent of all blood and blood products are used.<br />12 Second, I would note that in the<br />13 outpatient proposed rule the Medicare program has<br />14 proposed to cut leukoreduced red blood cells by<br />15 approximately 10 percent. I would note that the<br />16 APC advisory panel, which is an advisory panel that<br />17 specifically advises CMS on outpatient<br />18 reimbursement, has proposed that CMS freeze blood<br />19 and blood product payment at 2005 levels. As I<br />20 understand it, the American Red Cross and AABB and<br />21 America's Blood Centers are also behind that<br />22 recommendation, and I hope that this committee<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (107 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />108<br />1 would support that recommendation to have payment<br />2 levels frozen.<br />3 Finally, I would like to thank CMS and<br />4 this committee for issuing transmittal 496 which<br />5 has attempted to provide additional consolidation<br />6 clarification in blood reimbursement guidance to<br />7 hospitals and billers and coders nationwide. I<br />8 would note that we are working in coalition with<br />9 ABC, AABB and the Red Cross to provide some<br />10 additional recommendations to refine that guidance<br />11 and further clarify the regulations. Thank you<br />12 very much for your time.<br />13 Committee Discussion<br />14 DR. BRECHER: Thank you. Any additional<br />15 public comments? If not, the committee will go<br />16 into a discussion period regarding the morning<br />17 presentations. Before we begin, I want to stress<br />18 that I think it is clear that HHS has heard the<br />19 message about IVIG. They are continuing to monitor<br />20 the situation. I don't want to speak for CMS, but<br />21 I think that they are also hearing the message.<br />22 So, comments? Questions? Proposals?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (108 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />109<br />1 I guess one question is does the committee<br />2 need to send another message to the Assistant<br />3 Secretary and the Secretary, or has the message<br />4 already been delivered? Jay?<br />5 DR. EPSTEIN: I can't answer your second<br />6 question. I think the committee might have to<br />7 discuss that a bit. I guess my take on what is<br />8 going on is that the problem hasn't been solved. I<br />9 think what we have heard is that patients are<br />10 continuing to suffer the kinds of disruptions in<br />11 care that were described to us months ago and,<br />12 although there has been movement at CMS to update<br />13 the reimbursement schedule, there are underlying<br />14 problems that remain to be solved.<br />15 I guess one question in my mind is how one<br />16 might react to the consensus proposal that was<br />17 brought forward by the PPTA. I personally do not<br />18 feel sufficiently expert--in fact, I am totally<br />19 ignorant--to understand how these might help the<br />20 situation, but it does strike me that if a<br />21 thoughtful group got together and looked from a<br />22 collective standpoint among stakeholders on how to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (109 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />110<br />1 make things better, that these suggestions warrant<br />2 some consideration.<br />3 DR. BRECHER: Karen?<br />4 MS. LIPTON: I agree with Jay. I don't<br />5 feel competent myself to evaluate the proposals. I<br />6 think we do need to send a message that the issue,<br />7 even though they are taking steps, isn't resolved<br />8 and perhaps we could specifically request that they<br />9 sit down and look at some of the proposals that<br />10 have been put forward. I think there is something<br />11 going on that is a lot bigger. And, I do think it<br />12 was very interesting, looking at the ASD, and I was<br />13 trying to run through it very quickly while she was<br />14 speaking, but it does appear to me that we are also<br />15 seeing a shift in manufacturing and I don't totally<br />16 understand how switching the recombinant is<br />17 affecting all of this, but I suspect that we are<br />18 stuck in a place perhaps where the model and the<br />19 return for these companies is shifting dramatically<br />20 and we don't understand how that is affecting both<br />21 the reimbursement policies and the effect on<br />22 patient accessibility to these products. But I<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (110 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />111<br />1 think it is something that we need to pay attention<br />2 to, and I think in looking at the reimbursement<br />3 they really do need to go deeper and look at how<br />4 the market is shifting.<br />5 DR. BRECHER: Celso?<br />6 DR. BIANCO: Well, I want to support Jay<br />7 and Karen and say that we should send a message or<br />8 at least a reminder that this is unresolved.<br />9 DR. BRECHER: It sounds like that, at a<br />10 minimum, what we are going to do is at least say<br />11 that the problem is ongoing and requires further<br />12 attention and consideration of other solutions,<br />13 such as perhaps what PPTA has suggested. Do we<br />14 want to draft that at this time, or do we want to<br />15 save the draft wording until tomorrow? Tomorrow?<br />16 Okay. So, why don't we take a break now, a<br />17 15-minute break?<br />18 [Brief recess]<br />19 DR. BRECHER: We are going to resume if<br />20 everyone will take their seats. We are now going<br />21 to move on to a strategic plan for improving blood<br />22 safety in the 21st century. This is in some ways a<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (111 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />112<br />1 continuation of topics covered in our last two<br />2 meetings. We will start with a subcommittee report<br />3 from Jeanne Linden.<br />4 Strategic Plan for Improving Blood Safety<br />5 in the 21st Century<br />6 Report of Subcommittee Activity<br />7 DR. LINDEN: If you recall from the<br />8 previous meeting, the subcommittee had been<br />9 established to look at infectious risks--<br />10 DR. BRECHER: If everyone in the back<br />11 could, please, sit down and be quiet so we can hear<br />12 the speaker? Thank you.<br />13 DR. LINDEN: The subcommittee was also<br />14 tasked with looking at some of the issues about<br />15 risk reduction in blood safety and availability<br />16 that had broadly been discussed by this committee<br />17 on several different occasions at different<br />18 meetings. The subcommittee looked at these issues<br />19 and pondered discussions of would it be most<br />20 productive to write sort of a report; what sorts of<br />21 actions could we take given the resources that we<br />22 have? It was thought that really what we needed<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (112 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />113<br />1 was a strategic plan that would supplement the<br />2 existing FDA blood action plan that has been in<br />3 existence for several years to be more current, and<br />4 specifically address s some of the issues that had<br />5 arisen, both in the area of infectious diseases,<br />6 both in known pathogens and unknown agents that may<br />7 be emerging, as well as some of the non-infectious<br />8 risks which continue to be out there.<br />9 We took the basic issues that had come up<br />10 before and looked at eight different issues that<br />11 had been identified. One, the need for a<br />12 structured, open and transparent process for policy<br />13 and decision-making; the integration of the blood<br />14 system in the public health infrastructure; the<br />15 surveillance of adverse events related to blood<br />16 transfusion and blood donation, including the known<br />17 infectious diseases, the unknown or emerging<br />18 infectious diseases, as well as non-infectious<br />19 adverse reactions. A question for this was should<br />20 focus on blood only also include tissues, organs,<br />21 HPCs and coordination of risk communication to be<br />22 effective, accurate and timely; error prevention<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (113 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />114<br />1 and other non-infectious risks and, in terms of<br />2 blood availability, donor recruitment and retention<br />3 issues and coordination of those. Also, clinical<br />4 practice standards to address the judicious use<br />5 and, therefore, availability issues, as well as,<br />6 obviously, decreasing risks if people are not<br />7 transfused as much. Also, the importance or a<br />8 research agenda to address a variety of relevant<br />9 issues, including measuring outcomes of any<br />10 strategies that are taken to address risks. Also,<br />11 disaster planning and what further efforts could<br />12 supplement the existing task force.<br />13 What we did was take these eight items and<br />14 each member of the subcommittee was tasked with<br />15 specifically reviewing those particular<br />16 subjects--some of the things we learned; some of<br />17 the things we might already know from other<br />18 sources; some of the issues and questions that have<br />19 come up. So, the idea of what we wanted to do<br />20 today is recommend that the committee consider a<br />21 recommendation of putting together a strategic plan<br />22 and considering what elements might be in that<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (114 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />115<br />1 plan, and who would be involved, and what role HHS<br />2 could play in the committee possibly. So, that is<br />3 what we sort of wanted to put on the table.<br />4 Some of the members are going to be making<br />5 very brief presentations of the issues, posing some<br />6 questions which are not intended to be answered at<br />7 this committee or we would be here for weeks, but<br />8 really just to provoke some thought and discussion<br />9 for consideration in the overall scheme of what we<br />10 are talking about. So, our thought was, with the<br />11 Chair's permission, to take questions on the<br />12 presentation for, say, something that wasn't<br />13 understood without getting into discussion at this<br />14 time of the individual presentations. So, that was<br />15 our recommendation to the committee.<br />16 DR. BRECHER: Thank you, Jeanne. First we<br />17 will go to Jerry Holmberg.<br />18 Review of January and February 2005 Meetings<br />19 DR. HOLMBERG: My task on this was to go<br />20 back through and try to identify and review for you<br />21 the activities of the last couple of meetings. But<br />22 I do want to raise the questions that the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (115 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />116<br />1 subcommittee has put together to address this<br />2 issue. We will be discussing these at the very end<br />3 but I wanted you to start thinking about these<br />4 questions.<br />5 Does the committee believe that there is a<br />6 need for the Department to develop a strategic plan<br />7 for detecting and preventing<br />8 transfusion-transmitted complications? That<br />9 includes both infectious and non-infectious<br />10 complications in the 21st century.<br />11 If a strategic plan is recommended by the<br />12 committee, what scope of issues does the committee<br />13 believe that the plan should address, and what role<br />14 should the ACBSA and its subcommittees play in the<br />15 development of the strategic plan?<br />16 Jeanne already mentioned the HHS blood<br />17 plan that has been in effect for several years, and<br />18 one of the things that the strategic plan has<br />19 really helped was to really pave a path for future<br />20 direction. So, if we go back and even look at the<br />21 HHS strategic plan that was first initiated by the<br />22 Food and Drug Administration and then taken on by<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (116 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />117<br />1 the HHS, you can see that many of those things have<br />2 been accomplished. I did put that in your<br />3 handouts, to take a look at that because, by no<br />4 means, I don't think what we want to do is to take<br />5 away from what has already been done but I think it<br />6 has come to a point where we need to look, for the<br />7 future, where do we move from here.<br />8 I just want to go pack to August of 2004,<br />9 over a year ago, and I know that we have on the<br />10 committee several people that have experience now<br />11 with the transfusion-<br />12 related acute lung injury and we did talk about<br />13 TRALI at that time; the implementation of clinical<br />14 education; the model for impact of deferral on<br />15 screening interventions and the research that may<br />16 come along with that. So, I bring that out and I<br />17 think that Dr. Bracey will talk a little more about<br />18 that in his presentation of clinical outcomes and<br />19 then maybe also in the research and this may be<br />20 discussed also.<br />21 The response from the Secretary was to<br />22 continue to monitor progress of the scientific<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (117 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />118<br />1 community. Some of the action that has already<br />2 been taken is that the National Heart, Lung and<br />3 Blood Institute has moved TRALI to a top priority<br />4 of all non-infectious transfusion complications and<br />5 there are two institution-supported investigations<br />6 that are currently being pursued.<br />7 The other recommendation from August, 2004<br />8 was access to treatment for individuals with rare<br />9 bleeding disorders. From there, we have actually<br />10 looked at some of the research. We have also<br />11 developed a workshop. Not only did FDA develop a<br />12 workshop, HHS helped support it in trying to<br />13 determine what kind of pathways needed to be put<br />14 into place and then what kind of new products<br />15 needed to be out there. Then, of course, the<br />16 reimbursement issue.<br />17 The recommendations are being considered.<br />18 As mentioned numerous times last year, just before<br />19 Secretary Thompson left his position he did sign<br />20 off on his medical innovation process and each one<br />21 of the agencies has a part in this medical<br />22 innovation process. For instance, the FDA has the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (118 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />119<br />1 Critical Pathway and also, as I mentioned, we did<br />2 have a workshop put on by the FDA on this issue of<br />3 rare blood disorders.<br />4 In 2004 we also looked at bacterial<br />5 detection in plasma concentrations and seven-day<br />6 platelets. I don't really think we need to spend<br />7 much time on that. We have seen progress over the<br />8 last year and it was good to hear today that the<br />9 New York Blood Center is moving forward with this.<br />10 The recommendations on platelet detection<br />11 were that--of course, the Secretary's response was<br />12 that recommendations are being considered. The FDA<br />13 innovative regulatory pathway allowed collection of<br />14 post-approval information on the QC data, and they<br />15 modified the field study. AABB task force put<br />16 together two guidance documents and also put<br />17 together a survey, which Dr. Brecher is one of the<br />18 primary authors on that will be considered for<br />19 transfusion. I think it was very enlightening,<br />20 that survey, to see the impact of this and also<br />21 some business model changes that took place within<br />22 the blood field. Then, of course, we had activity<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (119 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />120<br />1 with the manufacturers.<br />2 One of the things too in August, just to<br />3 reflect back, in August, 2004 we talked about the<br />4 minipool nucleic acid test for blood donor testing.<br />5 This was a topic that was discussed at BPAC. It<br />6 was discussed at our internal blood safety<br />7 committee, and then also the Acting Assistant<br />8 Secretary referred this to the Advisory Committee<br />9 for Blood Safety and Availability.<br />10 The recommendation or the actions that<br />11 took place, as I already mentioned, were discussed<br />12 at the various advisory committees and finally the<br />13 Blood Safety Committee concurred with the FDA<br />14 policy and made the recommendation that came out<br />15 that current data do not support a recommendation<br />16 for routine use of the Roche molecular system<br />17 minipool NAT to screen blood donors and plasma<br />18 donors. Existing donor tests appear to be adequate<br />19 and the new test appears to provide very limited<br />20 public health benefit at this time. However,<br />21 public health officials will reconsider possible<br />22 recommendations for routine donor screening for HBV<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (120 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />121<br />1 by nucleic acid tests based on experience with<br />2 voluntary use of the test, further technology<br />3 developments, and any other factors that might<br />4 affect the public health benefits expected from<br />5 such testing.<br />6 In January of 2005 we had our meeting<br />7 where we talked about different issues. Topic one<br />8 was the bacterial detection and the progress<br />9 reports on seven-day platelets; the reimbursement<br />10 issues associated with plasma and recombinant<br />11 analog therapy. Then we started our discussion<br />12 which the subcommittee are really going to be<br />13 presenting today, and that is the current and<br />14 emerging infectious pathogens, sharpening our<br />15 approach to the 21st century to reduce the risk of<br />16 transfusion-transmitted diseases. As you can see<br />17 from that topic and from how Jeanne has already<br />18 introduced today's discussion, there has been some<br />19 evolution in our thinking and, hopefully, that will<br />20 come out today in some of the discussion. I will<br />21 quickly go over this. I really don't think we need<br />22 to spend time on the bacterial issue again.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (121 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />122<br />1 Reimbursement issues--I just want to say<br />2 that although at the last meeting the Secretary did<br />3 not respond to the recommendation, it was picked up<br />4 on and incorporated into the response that Dr.<br />5 Brecher got this summer and also some of the<br />6 comments that were referred to this morning by Ms.<br />7 Lee as far as the transmittal 496. A lot of that<br />8 was rolled into some of the endeavors that we were<br />9 working on.<br />10 Let me just quickly go through some of the<br />11 discussion that we had back in January on the<br />12 current and emerging infectious pathogens. We<br />13 looked at the IOM report on microbial threats to<br />14 health. This has been a very good guiding document<br />15 for a lot of us. I think that what we have seen<br />16 even over the last nine months has been that some<br />17 of the comments made in the IOM report as far as<br />18 the transmission of diseases have really magnified<br />19 or come to light, and that is that one of the<br />20 things that the IOM report talks about is natural<br />21 disasters.<br />22 Since then we have had the tsunami and we<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (122 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />123<br />1 have also had hurricane Katrina. We have to<br />2 constantly be thinking about how can some of these<br />3 natural disasters affect the way we do business.<br />4 Most recently, the AABB Transfusion-Transmitted<br />5 Disease Committee was even considering a voluntary<br />6 deferral for those people that were in shelters to<br />7 reduce the risk of hepatitis A virus. But I just<br />8 brought that out, that we need to keep going back<br />9 to the IOM report and take a look at some of those<br />10 recommendations. There is a lot of good<br />11 information in there.<br />12 We looked at an overview of current<br />13 blood-borne threats systems approach and we did a<br />14 case study of various disease entities and how did<br />15 we respond. I think everybody recognizes that for<br />16 the West Nile virus the stars were aligned and I<br />17 think that is one of the models that we really did<br />18 well. There have been papers written on it that<br />19 really explain some of the progress that was made.<br />20 But some of the issues, like with Chagas disease,<br />21 are still an unmet challenge; some of the HIV, the<br />22 evolving changes, HHV-8 still is unresolved; and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (123 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT</p><p>124<br />1 also the vCJD is a good example of risk<br />2 communication. So, we had a presentation of model<br />3 responses, unmet challenges, evolving challenges,<br />4 unresolved scientific evidence and risk<br />5 communication.<br />6 The IOM report, just to highlight some of<br />7 the things in the IOM report, talked about<br />8 enhancing global response capacity; rebuilding<br />9 domestic public health capacity; improving domestic<br />10 surveillance through better disease reporting;<br />11 explore innovative systems of surveillance; develop<br />12 and use diagnostics; educate and train the<br />13 microbial threat work force; develop vaccines and<br />14 production capacity; appropriate use of<br />15 antimicrobial drugs and new antimicrobial drugs;<br />16 vector-borne and zoonotic disease control;<br />17 comprehensive ID research agenda; and<br />18 interdisciplinary ID centers.<br />19 With that, at the end of that meeting we<br />20 sort of had a direction that we were looking at,<br />21 and that is that for future discussion we wanted to<br />22 look at surveillance, appropriate research, product<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (124 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />125<br />1 development, global information sharing,<br />2 transparency in policy process, and also risk<br />3 communication.<br />4 Just to show you some of the progress that<br />5 we have made, I think sometimes as a committee we<br />6 all--and I will use the collective "we"--we don't<br />7 realize the progress that we make. We make one set<br />8 of recommendations and move on and, at the same<br />9 time, government is still working in the background<br />10 so you don't see the impact of some of your<br />11 recommendations until much later. But this was a<br />12 request to CMS that talked about some of the<br />13 problems with reimbursement and plasma and<br />14 recombinant issues, and also some of the language<br />15 that was used within the MMA that needed to be<br />16 corrected.<br />17 I know this is hard for you to see but I<br />18 did incorporate this in your package. On May<br />19 13--and, unfortunately, I didn't get this before<br />20 the last meeting so I didn't have it to share with<br />21 you, but this was a response from Dr. McClellan,<br />22 thanking Dr. Beato for bringing a lot of these<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (125 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />126<br />1 issues to his attention and also, as you have<br />2 already heard from Ms. Lee this morning, the CMS<br />3 manual, the transmittal 496 which explains to<br />4 hospitals how to charge, and it incorporated some<br />5 of the corrections in some of the terminology. So,<br />6 we have made progress, and there is still more<br />7 progress that we need to make.<br />8 As I mentioned before, we identified these<br />9 issues as far as the different aspects of<br />10 surveillance, appropriate research, product<br />11 development, global information, transparency in<br />12 policy, and risk communication, and at the May<br />13 meeting we looked at approaches to reducing the<br />14 risk. We had Dr. Scwhartz, who talked about the<br />15 pandemic action plan, and he did a very good job.<br />16 At that point of his discussion the federal<br />17 government was still in a draft mode and I<br />18 understand that at the beginning of August the<br />19 draft action plan was submitted to the Secretary.<br />20 We also had discussions from various<br />21 public health officials, state and local. We had<br />22 discussions from the National Association of County<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (126 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />127<br />1 and City Health Officials, Association of State and<br />2 Territorial Health Officials, and the Council of<br />3 State and Territorial Epidemiologists. All three<br />4 of these groups came and talked to us. I think<br />5 that what we gleaned out of that discussion was<br />6 that there was a need for active communication and<br />7 that one of the things that the IOM report brought<br />8 out was that we have a very fragile grassroots<br />9 public health system. I think that is a problem<br />10 that has been mentioned over and over again in a<br />11 lot of the literature, but the discussions with<br />12 these three groups really brought to mind that we<br />13 really need to have active dialogue with them.<br />14 We also looked at various models of<br />15 disease reporting and adverse event surveillance.<br />16 We had the hospital epidemiology surveillance<br />17 system from CDC and also the hemophilia treatment<br />18 center database. They have some very unique ways<br />19 of tracking all of the patients that receive<br />20 products within the hemophilia treatment centers.<br />21 We also had some discussion on orphan test<br />22 development. Some of the other organisms we talked<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (127 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />128<br />1 about with Chagas and malaria and different<br />2 organisms--how could we move forward and<br />3 develop--instead of an orphan drug test or orphan<br />4 drug, is there a way that we could foster the<br />5 orphan test development?<br />6 Then, one of the things that I know Dr.<br />7 Beato appreciated very much was that the committee<br />8 did not rush into a recommendation. One of the<br />9 things that Dr. Beato has said numerous times is<br />10 where is the evidence to backup the<br />11 recommendations? And, has this been given adequate<br />12 thought? So, I really do appreciate that the<br />13 recommendations were tabled until the committee<br />14 could further discuss and concur on something to<br />15 put forward to the Secretary.<br />16 So, once again, I just come back to the<br />17 questions that I would like you to consider at the<br />18 end of our discussions over the next couple of<br />19 days: Does the committee believe there is a need<br />20 for the Department to develop a strategic plan for<br />21 detecting and preventing transfusion-transmitted<br />22 complications in the 21st century?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (128 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />129<br />1 If a strategic plan is recommended by the<br />2 committee, what scope of issues does the committee<br />3 believe that the plan should address, and what role<br />4 should the ACBSA and its subcommittees play in the<br />5 development of this strategic plan? Thank you.<br />6 DR. BRECHER: We have time for a couple of<br />7 content questions, if there are any. If not, we<br />8 will move on to the second speaker, Jay Epstein,<br />9 talking about a structured process for policy and<br />10 decision-making.<br />11 Structured Process for Policy and Decision-Making<br />12 DR. EPSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mark.<br />13 As your agenda shows and as Jeanne Linden<br />14 suggested, the subcommittee on EIDs considered the<br />15 question of whether there ought to be a<br />16 recommendation in favor of developing a new<br />17 strategic plan for blood safety and availability.<br />18 A set of elements was posed which are reflected in<br />19 a set of introductory talks, of which this is the<br />20 first.<br />21 So, the first element of a candidate plan<br />22 is a structured process for policy and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (129 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />130<br />1 decision-making. Let me start by suggesting that<br />2 effective action depends on making good decisions,<br />3 and this leads to the idea that one ought to review<br />4 the decision-making process itself to figure out<br />5 whether it has characteristics that would lead to<br />6 making good decisions.<br />7 The rationale for this is that ensuring an<br />8 adequate supply of safe blood is an essential<br />9 national responsibility that requires support at<br />10 the national level. Additionally, the cost,<br />11 complexity and evolution of the blood system<br />12 necessitate an ongoing process of decision-making<br />13 in order to set priorities and to address newly<br />14 recognized and emerging risks.<br />15 Additionally, the structured process can<br />16 foster better public health outcomes by promoting<br />17 the integration of scientific, economic and social<br />18 factors into the decisions while, at the same time,<br />19 enhancing their general acceptance.<br />20 Now, we did hear a presentation at the<br />21 January, 2005 committee meeting on the elements of<br />22 a good policy process based on work from expert<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (130 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />131<br />1 groups. Without, of course, the ability to go into<br />2 this in any detail, I am simply going to hit the<br />3 high points.<br />4 The experts in this field have suggested<br />5 that elements of a good policy process include an<br />6 outcome orientation based on a needs assessment; at<br />7 least within a democracy, a clear and open<br />8 decisional process of procedure; the development of<br />9 robust scientific evidence to support selected<br />10 policies and actions; the efficient use of both<br />11 human and financial resources; active engagement of<br />12 stakeholders as partners; and clear communication<br />13 of risks and benefits, including their<br />14 uncertainties.<br />15 Now, within that framework there is also a<br />16 concept that a structured process can lead both to<br />17 better decisions and better acceptance and<br />18 awareness of those decisions. These essentially<br />19 are formal tools. We call them assessment tools<br />20 that can be used to analyze the feasibility, the<br />21 likely benefit, the projected cost, the risks and<br />22 tradeoffs, equity, sustainability and timeliness of<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (131 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />132<br />1 these actions, and the use of these tools then<br />2 plans a role in a cyclical process of assessment,<br />3 action and reassessment that works more or less in<br />4 the following way:<br />5 One comes upon a situation. The first<br />6 step is to analyze the situation. Then one moves<br />7 to the construction and analysis of policy<br />8 alternatives, followed by a deliberate choice of<br />9 preferred options, presumably preferred on a<br />10 rational basis integrating the data that comes out<br />11 of these formal assessments. One must then<br />12 communicate the policy decision so as to encourage<br />13 not just understanding but also endorsement and<br />14 active participation. There is then the<br />15 implementation phase and, in a good quality process<br />16 that is inevitably accompanied by outcome<br />17 monitoring which then leads to reevaluation. So,<br />18 the cycle then repeats itself in essence<br />19 continually.<br />20 Once again, the experts in this field<br />21 would be quick to say that nothing in the real<br />22 world actually follows this schema; that you may<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (132 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />133<br />1 find yourself concurrently at different phases of<br />2 this process. But the conceptual model is helpful<br />3 because it gives you a road map of what you are<br />4 trying to do as you are in the midst of a problem<br />5 solving situation.<br />6 So, within this framework we are proposing<br />7 for consideration by the committee as issues that<br />8 might be incorporated in the tasking of a group to<br />9 develop strategic plan questions of this sort, and<br />10 these do reflect the characteristics of what I have<br />11 described as at least an academician's description<br />12 of a good policy and decision-making process:<br />13 First, is our national investment in blood<br />14 safety and availability sufficient to meet its<br />15 objectives? Second, are our policy and<br />16 decision-making processes adequately transparent<br />17 and inclusive? Third, do we utilize analytical<br />18 tools appropriately in our decision-making?<br />19 Lastly, are our decisions sufficiently<br />20 evidence-based?<br />21 Let me see if there is another slide--yes,<br />22 additional questions: Can we enhance the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (133 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />134<br />1 effectiveness of communication of our policies and<br />2 their rationale, and do we monitor the outcomes of<br />3 our decisions and actions sufficiently?<br />4 So then, this, hopefully, will provide the<br />5 committee with an introduction to what the<br />6 subcommittee thought about this element, should it<br />7 become an element of a strategic plan. I am happy<br />8 to answer any questions or we can just move on.<br />9 DR. BRECHER: Gerry?<br />10 DR. SANDLER: Dr. Epstein, in leadership<br />11 for the last couple of decades the nation hasn't<br />12 done very badly in terms of a strategic plan for<br />13 preventing this kind of a complication. Are you,<br />14 in front of an open mike, in a position to give us<br />15 your opinion as to whether such a plan would best<br />16 be accomplished by expanding the resources of the<br />17 team that you have been working with or whether,<br />18 for some reason, you think it would be necessary to<br />19 go external to your office to create such a thing?<br />20 I know it is a difficult question to answer but it<br />21 is the one that I would see as pertinent.<br />22 DR. EPSTEIN: Well, this is a personal<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (134 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />135<br />1 opinion and I am not speaking on behalf of my<br />2 agency, but my opinion is that we do have<br />3 structures in place that would permit us to do all<br />4 of the things that I have described at an even<br />5 higher level of proficiency, and that it is more a<br />6 question of putting forward the principles under<br />7 which we seek to operate in enhancing our ability<br />8 to do so, in other words, removing encumbrances.<br />9 But I do think that our structures are adequate to<br />10 the task. Others may debate this, of course.<br />11 DR. BRECHER: Karen?<br />12 MS. LIPTON: Jay, thanks. This is<br />13 actually a very good presentation to start us off<br />14 in again thinking about some of these issues. As I<br />15 look at it, I just wanted to respond that I think<br />16 what we have been saying around the table is that<br />17 our national investment isn't sufficient. As you<br />18 said, we may have the structures in place but we<br />19 really haven't managed to garner sufficient<br />20 resources to do what we all think we need to do,<br />21 both in the government and the private sector.<br />22 I would answer the second question in a<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (135 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />136<br />1 very positive framework. I think that we are<br />2 transparent and inclusive, and maybe that is<br />3 because we have this committee. I think that FDA<br />4 at the BPAC meeting has been successful in getting<br />5 the right people to make the decisions, and the<br />6 entire revamping that went on several years ago of<br />7 the advisory committee structure I think is<br />8 effective.<br />9 The one that I am not as clear about is<br />10 the analytical tools that we use in<br />11 decision-making, or at least I am not aware of all<br />12 of them and how evenly they are used in all of the<br />13 decisions. Actually, Jay, you may be able to<br />14 respond to that. From my perspective as a<br />15 committee member I am just not certain about that.<br />16 Are decisions sufficiently evidence-based?<br />17 I think they are when they can be. There are a<br />18 number of decisions that we sometimes have to make<br />19 because of maintaining public confidence in the<br />20 safety of the blood supply and adequacy. That is<br />21 how I would answer those questions. But, Jay,<br />22 could you comment on the analytical tools?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (136 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />137<br />1 DR. EPSTEIN: My feeling is that they<br />2 could be utilized more. Analytical tools are<br />3 difficult to use. They generally require gathering<br />4 and analyzing data, and that always raises an issue<br />5 of resources. Also, there is the balance between<br />6 studying problems and doing something about them.<br />7 And, using these kinds of tools is often also time<br />8 consuming and unless you planned well in advance<br />9 you find yourself in a situation where you need to<br />10 make a decision and you can't wait for that kind of<br />11 modeling. So, I tend to agree with you--and,<br />12 again, this is a personal opinion, not an agency<br />13 opinion--that that is an area where we could do<br />14 better.<br />15 DR. BRECHER: Celso?<br />16 DR. BIANCO: I just want to reinforce a<br />17 little bit of what was said. But, Jay, I think the<br />18 most important question that I feel is number one<br />19 is are national investments in blood safety and<br />20 availability sufficient to meet its objectives? I<br />21 think that we have to define a little bit better<br />22 the objectives. We talk in a generic sense about<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (137 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />138<br />1 safety and availability but we need to work on<br />2 that, and that would be part of the work for a<br />3 strategic plan.<br />4 The second thing is we have a combination<br />5 of approaches and groups that participate in the<br />6 process. There is the private sector of blood<br />7 collecting agencies, there is the private sector of<br />8 hospitals which manage the blood administration and<br />9 utilization, and we have regulatory agencies and<br />10 government. And you have this somewhat<br />11 schizophrenic thing in which we have the site of<br />12 collection being a volunteer site--sacred, white<br />13 hat, and always depending on the funding that is<br />14 obtained from the activities that follow blood<br />15 collection and the difficulty of placing itself<br />16 within the system. So, I think that we need to<br />17 expand a little bit that question. But I think<br />18 this is wonderful, what you just did.<br />19 DR. BRECHER: Last comment, Merlyn?<br />20 DR. SAYERS: That was outstanding.<br />21 Reference was made earlier by Karen to revamping of<br />22 the FDA's advisory committee, Blood Products<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (138 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />139<br />1 Advisory Committee. I saw that in a slightly<br />2 different light. It looked to me like a reduction<br />3 in opportunity for inclusiveness. I was wondering<br />4 what your opinion was. How does one get around the<br />5 sense that individuals can do with that specialized<br />6 knowledge, and by virtue of that knowledge,<br />7 inevitably find themselves in a conflictive<br />8 position? And, is it possible to get contributions<br />9 from those individuals without the decisions being<br />10 tainted by what might be seen as conflict on the<br />11 part of those contributions?<br />12 DR. EPSTEIN: I am not sure that that is<br />13 really a question for me, Merlyn. You know, how we<br />14 charter advisory committees is a very delicate<br />15 matter because the committees have to be free of<br />16 taints and, at the same time, they have to be<br />17 sufficiently expert to do their business. As you<br />18 know from all the orientations you have had to live<br />19 through, there is a body of regulations that<br />20 attempts to deal with that inherent tension, and<br />21 whether there are other ways that we could do<br />22 business I am not sure. I think one thing that we<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (139 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />140<br />1 do is have workshops where we can bring in experts<br />2 to speak freely as experts from their various<br />3 vantage points and try to separate that, as it<br />4 were, from the policy-making process per se so<br />5 that, at least at the stage of information<br />6 gathering and play of ideas, we don't have to worry<br />7 about who is speaking and why. But I think that<br />8 this is a very large issue and it has been the<br />9 subject of many, many deliberations over the years<br />10 by the Congress, by the agencies, by the IOM, and<br />11 it is just not a simple one.<br />12 DR. BRECHER: All right, Karen.<br />13 MS. LIPTON: Just one quick comment. I<br />14 think that, yes, the issue is the regulatory<br />15 structure and I think then it is incumbent upon us<br />16 to make sure that we participate in the process as<br />17 fully as we can, you know, giving the information<br />18 we can to the panel. I also think the workshops<br />19 are extremely helpful, and I know that that is<br />20 quite a stress on the staff. Do you feel that you<br />21 are adequately funded and resourced to do the<br />22 number of workshops that you would like to see take<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (140 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />141<br />1 place?<br />2 DR. EPSTEIN: Well, I think that we would<br />3 like to be able to do more workshops than we can<br />4 afford, put it that way. In any given year, we do<br />5 as many as half a dozen. Generally they are very<br />6 well received. There is the opportunity also for<br />7 the industry or other outside parties to sponsor<br />8 workshops to which FDA and other government<br />9 agencies will bring participation. I think that if<br />10 there were more of a shared agenda, it might<br />11 facilitate the process of finding sponsors,<br />12 co-sponsors and alternative sponsors. So, we live<br />13 in a world where we have significant resource<br />14 limitations and we attempt to leverage out efforts<br />15 through these co-sponsorships but, certainly, there<br />16 is room for more but it would require them to step<br />17 up.<br />18 DR. BRECHER: Thank you, Jay. We are now<br />19 going to move on to integration of the blood system<br />20 within the public health infrastructure, Judy<br />21 Angelbeck.<br />22 Integration of the Blood System within<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (141 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />142<br />1 the Public Health Infrastructure<br />2 DR. ANGELBECK: In considering this topic,<br />3 integration of the blood system within the public<br />4 health infrastructure, I certainly went back to<br />5 documents and talks that we had heard in the past<br />6 two meetings and reviewed that information an<br />7 considered the topic not only as one who<br />8 participates in the private sector of the blood<br />9 industry, but as a citizen who requires from time<br />10 to time perhaps healthcare--although I have never<br />11 required a blood transfusion but may at some point<br />12 in the future--and tried to understand how best to<br />13 address this topic.<br />14 So, what I tried to do here was to provide<br />15 just an overview strictly by identifying entities<br />16 that now participate in the current structures.<br />17 For the oversight of blood safety and availability<br />18 within the Department of Health and Human Services,<br />19 of course, there is the advisory committee. There<br />20 is the U.S. Public Health Service, the CDC, the<br />21 FDA, the NHLBI, and that is in cooperation with the<br />22 Department of Defense. Then, in the private sector<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (142 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />143<br />1 is the American Association of Blood Banks,<br />2 America's Blood Centers, the American Red Cross,<br />3 the Plasma Association and there are select state<br />4 health agencies, again back in the government<br />5 sector.<br />6 On the public health structure side, as I<br />7 saw what I reviewed, we are looking at government<br />8 agencies at various levels, from the United States<br />9 Public Health Service, the CDC, the FDA at the<br />10 federal level, state health agencies, territorial<br />11 health agencies, tribal health agencies, county<br />12 health departments, city health departments and<br />13 local health boards. A challenge, from my<br />14 perspective, to this integration is that the U.S.<br />15 blood and plasma collection and distribution is a<br />16 free enterprise network of non-profits and<br />17 for-profits. They are not governmental agencies.<br />18 In addition to that, from some of the<br />19 presentations at the previous meetings, what have<br />20 we learned about how those two structures interact?<br />21 9/11 underscored the need for a coordinated message<br />22 to the public about the need for blood. The<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (143 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />144<br />1 pre-event smallpox vaccination program emphasized<br />2 the need for advanced planning and consideration of<br />3 the impact of new vaccine programs on the blood<br />4 supply. Transfusion-associated West Nile virus<br />5 transmission required public health and blood<br />6 collection agency cooperation with the emergence of<br />7 a new infectious threat for the blood supply and<br />8 perhaps a place where all the stars were aligned<br />9 for what appears to have been a very successful<br />10 collaboration. Now, we are faced with situations<br />11 such as hurricane Katrina with what appears to be a<br />12 complete breakdown of the system, much less in our<br />13 future--we hope not--a pandemic.<br />14 So, questions to consider: At the<br />15 national level, state level or the community level,<br />16 what would integration of the blood system into the<br />17 public health system add to the blood safety and<br />18 availability?<br />19 Since the U.S. blood and plasma<br />20 distribution is a free enterprise network or<br />21 not-for-profit or for-profit, how could they be<br />22 integrated into a government public health<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (144 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />145<br />1 infrastructure?<br />2 In a major public health event, does blood<br />3 safety and availability have any real priority now<br />4 and would integration change that?<br />5 Is a collaboration rather than an<br />6 integration of the blood system into the public<br />7 health infrastructure a more realistic goal? If<br />8 so, then what strategies and tactics will aid in<br />9 building on the collaborative efforts that<br />10 succeeded in developing the response to<br />11 transfusion-associated West Nile virus?<br />12 Would integration of the blood system<br />13 within the public health infrastructure provide a<br />14 more coordinated approach and funding to dealing<br />15 with the threat of transfusion-transmitted diseases<br />16 and complications? That concludes my presentation.<br />17 DR. BRECHER: Content questions?<br />18 DR. BIANCO: A quick one, simple, very<br />19 easy to answer, what do you mean by integration?<br />20 How do you define integration?<br />21 DR. ANGELBECK: Well, that is a good<br />22 question and it is one that I struggled with. I<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (145 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />146<br />1 think integration of an organization could mean<br />2 that they are more closely aligned in their<br />3 structures and their development. If you look at<br />4 countries--for example one that I am most familiar<br />5 with as a customer of ours is Canada which has a<br />6 national blood system. It has a means of risk<br />7 assessment. It has a means of taking that through<br />8 the regulatory process and then interpreting that<br />9 into actions or recommendations to the blood<br />10 collecting organizations. Here, I feel our system<br />11 is much more fragmented and does not allow or<br />12 permit, for example, that level of coordination or<br />13 integration. When you have the blood collecting<br />14 and the blood supply essentially in the private<br />15 enterprise and you have public health in the<br />16 government, be it at the federal level or the state<br />17 level, they can partner but they cannot necessarily<br />18 integrate, in my view. They can be collaborative<br />19 in what they do but I don't see that in my<br />20 definition of integration. If that helps? I am<br />21 open to anyone else's definition of integration.<br />22 DR. BRECHER: Jay?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (146 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />147<br />1 DR. EPSTEIN: Well, one point that I think<br />2 you have made and that we have heard discussed at<br />3 previous meetings is that the public health<br />4 infrastructure itself, at least at present, is<br />5 fragmented.<br />6 DR. ANGELBECK: Yes.<br />7 DR. EPSTEIN: So, one could possibly take<br />8 the point of view that the blood system--probably<br />9 mainly because of two things, regulation and the<br />10 force of the voluntary trade organizations--is<br />11 actually much less fragmented than the public<br />12 health system. So, I wonder what exactly it means<br />13 to integrate the blood system in the public health<br />14 infrastructure.<br />15 That said, I couldn't agree more strongly<br />16 that we do need a better interactive dialogue to<br />17 make decisions about blood safety and availability<br />18 in the larger context of public health planning,<br />19 but how you get there in the current state of<br />20 affairs I think is a little bit puzzling.<br />21 DR. ANGELBECK: I think it would be very<br />22 challenging. I think you would need to go outside<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (147 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />148<br />1 the box perhaps to figure out how to do that.<br />2 DR. BRECHER: Any other questions or<br />3 comments? It is interesting that, despite having<br />4 such a fragmented system, I think we have been more<br />5 successful than almost any other country in<br />6 protecting our blood supply. So, we shouldn't lose<br />7 sight of that. Thank you, Judy.<br />8 Jerry Holmberg is going to fill in for Mat<br />9 Kuehnert, who could not be at this meeting to talk<br />10 about surveillance for adverse events related to<br />11 blood donation and transfusion.<br />12 Surveillance for Adverse Events Related to Blood<br />13 Donation and Transfusion<br />14 DR. HOLMBERG: I am sure that Matt would<br />15 do a much better job than I am going to do but he<br />16 sent me his information by way of blackberry from<br />17 where he was deployed in the South so I will try to<br />18 give it justice.<br />19 Some of the things that he wanted us to<br />20 look at are, first of all, with surveillance there<br />21 appears to be a need to define what we need by<br />22 surveillance. As we know, in other countries there<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (148 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:00 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />149<br />1 are programs in place for hemovigilance, and his<br />2 comment here is either as part of or distinct from<br />3 hemovigilance.<br />4 Some aspects of surveillance are<br />5 monitoring the known pathogens that are tested, and<br />6 that seems to be what many other countries do;<br />7 monitoring adverse events; outcomes in recipients;<br />8 and then monitoring availability and transfusion<br />9 practices which, again, I think Dr. Bracey will<br />10 refer to.<br />11 The thing that I think we all learned from<br />12 our last meeting was that there are some<br />13 surveillance systems that already exist at CDC,<br />14 FDA, Health and Human Services and also at NIH, NIH<br />15 with the research at NHLBI with repository of<br />16 samples that they have. But some of the weaknesses<br />17 that have been identified are a fragmented or<br />18 absence of integration. I don't know so much of<br />19 fragmented but definitely, from my point of view<br />20 and from what I have heard, it just seems like a<br />21 lot of these surveillance systems do not talk<br />22 together and share the information.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (149 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />150<br />1 Also, another weakness is that there is<br />2 passive reporting. Definitely, we have a lack of<br />3 denominator in trying to determine how large of an<br />4 issue we are looking at.<br />5 Few approaches to unknown pathogens, and<br />6 that is something that we are constantly really<br />7 looking at, that is, how do we look beyond the<br />8 horizon? There is also little emphasis on clinical<br />9 education of transfusion-transmitted infections.<br />10 What we also learned from our previous<br />11 meetings is that we need to consider both domestic<br />12 and global needs. Again, partnership in public<br />13 health needs to be identified and encouraged, and<br />14 this might go along with the collaboration or the<br />15 integration of the public health system. Matt also<br />16 laid out that the possible interventions include<br />17 integration and standardization of existing tools,<br />18 in other words, can we ride along on some of the<br />19 other systems that are currently out there but just<br />20 enhance them? Analyze analysis of data on<br />21 currently screened pathogens; use of repositories<br />22 for pathogens and disease discovery; coordination<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (150 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />151<br />1 of transfusion adverse event systems; connection<br />2 between blood availability and adverse event<br />3 systems.<br />4 Again, I think that Art will talk more<br />5 about this but creating a link to clinicians for<br />6 feedback of data and, at the same time, educate on<br />7 transfusion-associated adverse events and<br />8 transfusion utilization.<br />9 I think that over the last couple of years<br />10 we have heard a lot of discussion about the<br />11 hemovigilance versus biovigilance, and I think the<br />12 general conclusion or some of the comments that<br />13 have been brought forward are that all transfused<br />14 and transplanted human-derived products need to be<br />15 considered in an integrated response.<br />16 Some of the questions and, again, these<br />17 are questions that I created; Matt did not create<br />18 these but I throw them out to you: In a perfect<br />19 world what would surveillance to ensure blood<br />20 safety include? Should blood safety surveillance<br />21 include HPC organs and tissues? If so, how would a<br />22 case for this be developed to support it?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (151 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />152<br />1 DR. BRECHER: Questions for Jerry?<br />2 DR. BRACEY: Well, one thing I think we<br />3 really should focus on is that a lot of the effort<br />4 has been focused on surveillance of infectious<br />5 diseases and non-infectious problems that we<br />6 encounter. I think it is a very important part of<br />7 our task. I am a bit concerned about the<br />8 involvement of the end-user, the hospitals. You<br />9 know, the surveillance that we talk about is<br />10 surveillance that has been sort of government<br />11 structured and required reporting. But for many of<br />12 the non-infectious complications and other<br />13 complications of transfusion there really isn't a<br />14 driving force that would, in essence, make the<br />15 hospital share that information. So, I think one<br />16 of the things we need to consider is a way to<br />17 engage that group of folks as well.<br />18 DR. BRECHER: Yes, we have talked about<br />19 this in the past, that maybe some sort of sentinel<br />20 hospital program that aggressively went out and<br />21 looked for complications as opposed to passive<br />22 reporting might be one solution. Thank you, Jerry.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (152 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />153<br />1 Now we are going to move on to<br />2 coordination of risk communication, Karen Shoos<br />3 Lipton.<br />4 Coordination of Risk Communication<br />5 MS. LIPTON: Thank you. We really<br />6 haven't, in the committee as it exists today or as<br />7 it is presently constituted, had any formal<br />8 presentations on risk communication so what I am<br />9 going to talk about today is really some of the<br />10 presentations and public comments that we have<br />11 heard that have raised the theme of risk<br />12 communication, and then move on to my own research,<br />13 thanks to Judy Angelbeck and to Jerry Holmberg, on<br />14 some of the principles of risk communication that I<br />15 have looked at for the committee.<br />16 I think we can all say that the NGO and<br />17 the federal agency representatives have all<br />18 described the difficulties that are inherent in<br />19 effective communication to physicians and patients<br />20 about emerging risks to the blood supply. The<br />21 subcommittee actually included risk communication<br />22 as one of the proposed elements in the strategic<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (153 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />154<br />1 plan for blood safety and availability that is<br />2 going to be put forth before this committee today.<br />3 Current barriers to effective risk communication<br />4 that have been identified in presentations are,<br />5 first, lack of a formal and integrated process for<br />6 risk assessment process. That is, what are we<br />7 going to say the risks and benefits are? What do<br />8 we not know about a topic? What do we know and who<br />9 is responsible for bringing that assessment<br />10 together?<br />11 Risk assessment is not optimally<br />12 harmonized or coordinated on a global level. We<br />13 are seeing more and more that some of the things<br />14 that are happening outside of the United States<br />15 where people are taking actions and making<br />16 pronouncements to the public are coming into our<br />17 country and it is not always clear that we are in<br />18 advance of that, having appropriate discussions.<br />19 Timeliness of risk communication is a<br />20 tremendously big issue for all of us. Sometimes I<br />21 believe that some of the associations and other<br />22 patient advocacy groups feel that they need to make<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (154 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />155<br />1 communications that have to occur in advance of<br />2 federal agency action or information, and it is<br />3 just because they have an advocacy group or a<br />4 constituency that is really waiting for information<br />5 and getting it tomorrow is really critically<br />6 important.<br />7 Then accountability for risk communication<br />8 is not well understood. I mean, certainly we have<br />9 a legal system that tells certain organizations<br />10 that they have an obligation to inform of risk but<br />11 I think that generically we don't quite understand<br />12 among all of us, whether it is the AABB, ABC or<br />13 FDA, who has the primary role in communicating<br />14 risk.<br />15 Application of risk communication<br />16 principles--again, I went back and started looking<br />17 at some of the scientific literature and it is true<br />18 that risk communication is a science-based<br />19 approach, and it is a science-based approach for<br />20 communicating effectively in what they call high<br />21 concern situations. There are a lot of things that<br />22 were said about risk communication but I thought<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (155 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT</p><p>156<br />1 perhaps the most important was that risk<br />2 communication is a two-way, interactive process<br />3 that respects different values and treats the<br />4 public as a full partner. Sometimes what that<br />5 means is that you need to communicate with the<br />6 public in some way through focus groups or<br />7 something else to understand what their concerns<br />8 are before you even develop the message.<br />9 Major barriers to effective risk<br />10 communication--well, it is conflict and lack of<br />11 coordination among the stakeholders; inadequate<br />12 risk communication planning, preparation,<br />13 resources, skills and practice. We heard a number<br />14 of presentations that commented on, well, the<br />15 message might have been right but it was the wrong<br />16 person stating the message. We have also heard<br />17 that sometimes even the skill of the person<br />18 presenting the message--are they a credible person<br />19 to the public or to the patient population is very,<br />20 very important.<br />21 Incomplete understanding and application<br />22 of models that are highly predictive of how people<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (156 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />157<br />1 react to communication of risk, this is really<br />2 where the scientific principle comes in because<br />3 there is a lot of literature out there and a lot of<br />4 scientific modeling around specific words that<br />5 should be used when you talk about risk<br />6 communication; specific words when you talk about<br />7 lack of information but you still need to<br />8 communicate. And, we probably could do a better<br />9 job of integrating those into our own risk<br />10 communication process.<br />11 So, the questions for this committee to<br />12 consider: Are the roles for communicating risk in<br />13 various circumstances clearly defined? How should<br />14 the message be developed? Who is the target<br />15 audience and who should deliver the message and in<br />16 what media?<br />17 Two, are the principles of effective risk<br />18 communication clearly understood by the parties<br />19 responsible for creating and delivering the<br />20 message?<br />21 Three, should there be a risk<br />22 communication plan relating to threats to safety of<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (157 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />158<br />1 the blood supply? I called it safety of blood<br />2 processes for lack of a better word but that is<br />3 really around the issue of things like<br />4 glucoreduction and bacterial detection? And,<br />5 should there be a risk communication plan relating<br />6 to threats to blood availability? That concludes<br />7 my presentation.<br />8 DR. BRECHER: Content questions?<br />9 [No response]<br />10 I guess that was perfectly clear. Thank<br />11 you, Karen. Our last speaker before we break for<br />12 lunch is Jeanne Linden on error prevention in blood<br />13 collection centers, transfusion services and<br />14 clinical transfusion settings.<br />15 Error Prevention in Blood Collection Centers,<br />16 Transfusion Services and Clinical<br />17 Transfusion Settings<br />18 DR. LINDEN: This topic, although it<br />19 wasn't discussed recently, has been discussed<br />20 previously by this committee and we have had some<br />21 presentations focused not solely on the infectious<br />22 risks but significant risks, particularly in terms<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (158 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />159<br />1 of mortality currently that continue to be acute<br />2 transfusion reactions due to errors in blood<br />3 administration or preparation, and so forth, and<br />4 also TRALI, which we have talked about previously.<br />5 Many of the errors, based on analysis to<br />6 date, appear to be preventable. Therefore, we may<br />7 be able to do something about those. And, there<br />8 tend to be underlying systems factors in many<br />9 cases, what are be called latent systems pathogens<br />10 that may be present that predispose to some of<br />11 these active errors, and identification of those<br />12 may facilitate preventing errors and just making<br />13 the process of transfusion safer. We tend, in this<br />14 committee, to look at infectious diseases and blood<br />15 safety in terms of the product itself but<br />16 transfusion is really a process. It goes from the<br />17 donor's vein all the way to the recipient's vein<br />18 and the product could be completely sterile, but if<br />19 it is the wrong component for the wrong person,<br />20 then that can be just as deadly as an infectious<br />21 disease.<br />22 We also have heard that many of the issues<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (159 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />160<br />1 identified in the transfusion process have<br />2 commonalities with other industries, including some<br />3 with very significant adverse events such as the<br />4 aviation industry and the nuclear power industry.<br />5 Some of these other industries have done a very<br />6 good job in having good error reporting systems and<br />7 identifying factors that can be addressed. So,<br />8 what could we, in the blood industry, in a plan use<br />9 from those other industries as lessons that could<br />10 be incorporated?<br />11 One difference, however, is that the blood<br />12 transfusion process does involve many different<br />13 individuals with different types of expertise. As<br />14 Dr. Bracey just mentioned, here the input of the<br />15 clinicians has often not been incorporated as much<br />16 as it could be and they, on the front line, are<br />17 very critical to this process and, in fact, several<br />18 studies have shown that over half of the<br />19 transfusion-related errors are outside the blood<br />20 band, are on the clinical side and that is where it<br />21 may be productive to focus some of our efforts.<br />22 There certainly are quite a few existing<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (160 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />161<br />1 surveillance systems. They are not really<br />2 coordinated or comprehensive. There is a lot of<br />3 focus on fatalities and morbidities as sentinel<br />4 events. As has been mentioned with infectious<br />5 disease surveillance, there is often not a lot of<br />6 denominator data available with many of these<br />7 systems. A couple--you know, the U.K. system has<br />8 some fairly good data. A lot of the rest are<br />9 estimates at this point and this is another place<br />10 where we could put further efforts.<br />11 Assuming that strategies to prevent errors<br />12 can be identified in this process, if they are to<br />13 do any good they need to be implemented. They must<br />14 be acceptable to the individuals, the stakeholders<br />15 who are going to be using them. Thus, their input<br />16 needs to be incorporated into the process. They<br />17 can not be too cumbersome. They should make it<br />18 easy to do the right thing and difficult to do the<br />19 wrong thing, when possible. They need to address<br />20 human factors issues in their design, and how can<br />21 that be accomplished and applied to the blood<br />22 transfusion setting to promote blood safety?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (161 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />162<br />1 So, some of the questions to think about<br />2 are how can surveillance of non-infectious risks,<br />3 and specifically errors that are identified,<br />4 increase the knowledge of these risks and<br />5 facilitate the identification of the underlying<br />6 systems factors through a root cause analysis type<br />7 of approach or some other approach to identify<br />8 these underlying problems?<br />9 What else can we learn by looking at some<br />10 of these other industries? How can we apply these<br />11 lessons to this particular situation? And, how can<br />12 we get input and involve the clinicians in the<br />13 process of determining what the goals would be and,<br />14 once those goals are determined, to raise the<br />15 awareness of these problems so that they feel that<br />16 they are involved in the process, accept the<br />17 strategies that have been identified, and also to<br />18 increase the recognition of adverse reactions when<br />19 do occur to facilitate early intervention which may<br />20 be possible?<br />21 Who exactly are the stakeholders that need<br />22 to be involved? What is the role of the Department<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (162 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />163<br />1 and this committee and how could these issues, even<br />2 the transfusion process, the non-infectious risks<br />3 perhaps be incorporated into surveillance systems<br />4 that we are discussing for infectious<br />5 complications? Can those be more integrated as a<br />6 total human vigilance type of approach as is done,<br />7 for example in the United Kingdom where they look<br />8 at all of the serious hazards of transfusion and<br />9 not only the infectious ones?

BRECHER: If everyone will take their<br />4 seats, we are going to get started again.<br />5 We are going to begin with Dr. Bianco<br />6 talking about donor recruitment and retention.<br />7 Donor Recruitment and Retention<br />8 DR. BIANCO: As I started working on those<br />9 questions to the committee, as part of this kind of<br />10 strategic thinking for our program, I went back and<br />11 reviewed the committee recommendations pertaining<br />12 to blood donors.<br />13 We hear a lot about blood donors, or heard<br />14 at least in the past, there was always the theme of<br />15 the blood shortage, the concern whose<br />16 responsibility was the blood shortage, what could<br />17 be done to alleviate it, and what was the role that<br />18 this committee could have, and government in<br />19 general, in terms of helping with that.<br />20 So, it starts in April '99 when we<br />21 reviewed actually the discussions on<br />22 hemochromatosis and was the timing when FDA also<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (164 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />165<br />1 looked at those questions and ultimately, came with<br />2 ways by which individuals with hemochromatosis<br />3 could donate, and their blood could be used for<br />4 transfusion.<br />5 There was somewhat of a fantasy that this<br />6 was going to resolve the problems of the blood<br />7 supply, but certainly we all know that their<br />8 contribution, while it is meaningful, it was not<br />9 enough to really resolve it.<br />10 The second thing was the discussion that<br />11 we should, because of the shortages, and maybe to<br />12 better understand the blood system in the country,<br />13 that we should collect data. There wasn't enough<br />14 data, and there isn't enough data, and there aren't<br />15 too many models that can predict blood shortages.<br />16 We know, on Mondays, what is the total<br />17 that was collected by all the movie houses in the<br />18 country per movie, but we really don't know how<br />19 many units of blood are in our shelves except that<br />20 now organizations are working harder to try to<br />21 collect that, and the market has found a system of<br />22 balancing supply, and actually, we are in a period<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (165 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />166<br />1 in the last couple of years after all the<br />2 investments of a reasonable blood supply.<br />3 In January 2002, we continued discussions,<br />4 but now they were tainted by the September 11<br />5 disaster, and the concern that we all had that we<br />6 should have mechanisms to fund the development of a<br />7 reserve that could make sure that in case of need,<br />8 we would have that blood.<br />9 There was a recommendation from this<br />10 committee for funding, not only funding, but to<br />11 evaluate in a recommendation to the Secretary, and<br />12 to really make the blood donor and the blood<br />13 donation a national service, and recognize it as<br />14 many of the other public services that are<br />15 performed by the population.<br />16 I remember someone mentioning at that<br />17 time, I believe it was Ron Gilcher, if we have<br />18 volunteer fire departments, if we have volunteer<br />19 ambulances, we should, in the same way, have enough<br />20 people dedicated to blood donation.<br />21 In September 2002, we continued to discuss<br />22 the promotion of blood donations through a number<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (166 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />167<br />1 of mechanisms that could help raise the level of<br />2 the blood supply, but again, we did not resolve at<br />3 that time who was going to be in charge of that.<br />4 There was the hope that sometimes was interpreted<br />5 as whining that government would take a fundamental<br />6 role in funding this approach.<br />7 In 2004, in January 2004, we again decided<br />8 that it was very important to take steps to develop<br />9 a 5- to 7-day inventory of blood components in all<br />10 blood centers to stabilize the blood system.<br />11 Again, here, we identified CMS through<br />12 reimbursement as an agency that could contribute to<br />13 that effort, and that a national blood reserve<br />14 should be funded as a government-private sector<br />15 partnership. That has not happened.<br />16 So, I think that the questions that come,<br />17 and those discussions very much reflect over time,<br />18 all the issues that were raised regarding blood<br />19 donors, is what is the blood safety and<br />20 availability role of each of the responsible<br />21 parties.<br />22 We are, and I think that integration was<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (167 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />168<br />1 the word that Judy came with, but essentially, what<br />2 is the role of the blood providers, should they do<br />3 it by themselves, should they fund entirely the<br />4 donor recruitment, or is there some government,<br />5 social responsibility in that sense?<br />6 I think that that question is unanswered,<br />7 and we have let it to go through market forces that<br />8 not always works. I believe that this should be<br />9 discussed in detail, what is the role of<br />10 transfusion services--and we will have Art<br />11 discussing some of that in a few minutes--the role<br />12 of government and each one of its agencies, HHS,<br />13 this committee, FDA, CDC, National Heart, Lung, and<br />14 Blood Institute, and CMS, and then Homeland<br />15 Security and FEMA that have been very much in the<br />16 news in the last few days, state and local<br />17 authorities.<br />18 Who should participate of the process,<br />19 what is the responsibility of each one regarding<br />20 blood donations?<br />21 The second question is what is the ideal<br />22 blood supply? We had concerns or have concerns<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (168 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />169<br />1 from time to time about the supply, shortages, and<br />2 the impact that it has in the whole healthcare<br />3 system, but we don't have an answer what is the<br />4 ideal blood supply - is it 3 days, 5 days, 7 days,<br />5 25 days? How many days inventory are necessary and<br />6 sufficient?<br />7 This is a short-lived product, we don't<br />8 want wastage, but at the same time, we don't want<br />9 to be in a situation where we don't have what we<br />10 need, and that has to be decided.<br />11 And then, what is the additional inventory<br />12 of red cells, platelets, and plasma needed to be<br />13 maintained to ensure availability during times of<br />14 the collection, and here, we can talk about<br />15 Christmas, summer, and emergencies. There is<br />16 localized epidemics, public health actions like<br />17 mass vaccinations for it could be smallpox, massive<br />18 donor deferrals, or a disaster like happened with<br />19 Katrina, that is there, not so much the need of<br />20 blood was the issue, but certainly the blood center<br />21 in New Orleans, the building was destroyed.<br />22 They are working out of their--they moved<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (169 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />170<br />1 their operations to Baton Rouge, and they have a<br />2 contribution from Dallas, from Carter Blood Care,<br />3 that is actually housing some of its staff, but<br />4 their collections were totally disrupted, as were<br />5 the collections of several blood centers in<br />6 Mississippi and in Louisiana.<br />7 Finally, how do we fund that? Is it still<br />8 even if the donor is a volunteer that is donating<br />9 blood to us, and if the rest of the system has to<br />10 work under market forces, who should fund it, is<br />11 the hospital and payer that will pay for that<br />12 effort of having these donors, or is there a role<br />13 for more of society to invest in this process?<br />14 If there are any questions, I will be glad<br />15 to attempt to clarify them.<br />16 DR. BRECHER: Any comments or questions?<br />17 [No response.]<br />18 DR. BRECHER: Perfectly clear, Celso.<br />19 Thank you.<br />20 We are now going to move on to the<br />21 Clinical Practice Standards for Transfusion, Art<br />22 Bracey.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (170 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />171<br />1 Clinical Practice Standards for Transfusion<br />2 DR. BRACEY: By way of background, the<br />3 committee has not discussed the actual clinical<br />4 indications for transfusion in previous meetings,<br />5 so I would have a blank as my first slide.<br />6 But I think one of the things that we all<br />7 know, and many of us around the table have invested<br />8 a lot of time in this activity, is that many<br />9 transfusions today aren't necessary. If one<br />10 surveys the literature, you can find papers that<br />11 report anywhere from 20 to 50 percent inappropriate<br />12 transfusion incidents, and that is a problem.<br />13 In addition, in medicine, one of the<br />14 mantras is first do no harm, and really, the<br />15 inappropriate use of blood increases the risk of<br />16 the transfusion therapy irrespective of how safe<br />17 the unit is.<br />18 You know, much of our focus has been on<br />19 minimizing the infectious risk of blood, but we<br />20 must be certainly aware of the fact that as the<br />21 infectious risk decreases, that alters physician<br />22 behavior. The physicians then may begin to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (171 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />172<br />1 transfuse more liberally, and then to perhaps<br />2 enhance other risks associated with transfusion.<br />3 Clearly, as in driving SUVs and consuming<br />4 lots of gas, unneeded transfusions will have a<br />5 direct impact on blood availability. You know,<br />6 it's amazing. Many transfusion services, if you<br />7 talk to folks out in the hallways at national<br />8 meetings, they will see, "Well, what do you do<br />9 during a blood shortage?"<br />10 Well, you know, I just go around and tell<br />11 the guy that he doesn't need to give that<br />12 transfusion today, but we don't do this on an<br />13 ongoing basis. So, we have a system that really is<br />14 a permissive system, but not a system that is very<br />15 proactive in terms of controlling how blood is<br />16 used.<br />17 Transfusion practice is highly variable.<br />18 Dr. Toy and other members of the Transfusion<br />19 Medicine Academic Awardee Group had a very<br />20 interesting study of one select group of patients,<br />21 and these are cardiac surgery patients, and they<br />22 have demonstrated that depending upon the hospital<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (172 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />173<br />1 that you are in, your risk of transfusion varied<br />2 anywhere from 25 percent up to 100 percent, and<br />3 this was in 1992.<br />4 What is amazing to me is that if you look<br />5 at a follow-up study done by a group of<br />6 anesthesiologists, well, it's about the same. So,<br />7 there is a great degree of variation in terms of<br />8 practice, and I think it really behooves us to look<br />9 at why is there such wide variation.<br />10 Now, one big part of the problem is that<br />11 there are really no uniformly accepted guidelines.<br />12 The NIH, recognizing in the early '80s that we<br />13 really did have problems in terms of, you know,<br />14 when one needed to use blood components, set up a<br />15 series of consensus conferences, and there was some<br />16 good information that came out of there.<br />17 A lot of the information really basically<br />18 said that we need more information, but what<br />19 happened then is that various subspecialties or<br />20 societies developed guidelines, so you had all<br />21 these--really, the guidelines weren't divergent,<br />22 but they still weren't uniform.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (173 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />174<br />1 They weren't not one and the same. So,<br />2 for the physician, one would have to decide whether<br />3 to use the ASA guidelines, or whether to use ASIM<br />4 guideline. There is no single guideline.<br />5 Even worse is if you are in a hospital, if<br />6 you practice in a city and go from hospital A to<br />7 hospital B, between those two entities, there could<br />8 be totally divergent guidelines for transfusion, so<br />9 it would really be helpful to have a uniform<br />10 guideline.<br />11 Sonny Dzik recently published a paper<br />12 looking at the use of FFP, and the paper's title, I<br />13 think really speaks the problem that we have. Its<br />14 title was A Paucity of Clinical Trials Exists--I<br />15 can't remember the exact title, but he captured the<br />16 scenario. There is a paucity, there is a dearth of<br />17 clinical trials related to transfusion decisions.<br />18 Now, there is help on the way, because the<br />19 NIH and the NHLBI has a Transfusion Medicine and<br />20 Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network that is in<br />21 progress to address some of these issues, but<br />22 still, in this point in time, there are very few<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (174 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />175<br />1 clinical trials that we can use.<br />2 Beyond that, if one looks at systems--and<br />3 we talked before about communication systems,<br />4 public health talking to, et cetera--if you look at<br />5 operations within a hospital, the way things work,<br />6 our systems, to predict transfusion requirement,<br />7 really need to get improved.<br />8 If you look at certain facilities or<br />9 publications where they have designed a near-site<br />10 testing systems' ready access to data, so that one<br />11 could transfuse based upon data-driven decisions,<br />12 you always see improvement, but that is the<br />13 exception. Hospitals that have that sort of a<br />14 system are the exception rather than the rule.<br />15 Even further, if you look at the tools<br />16 that we have to diagnose a deficiency in the blood<br />17 in terms of its function or the need of a given<br />18 patient, we are also limited, very limited.<br />19 I mean there was the meeting of the<br />20 Hemoglobin Oxygen Carriers Group, and they just<br />21 couldn't decide, you know, what was a reasonable<br />22 hemoglobin. If you look at evolving issues in the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (175 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />176<br />1 field now, there are patients that are getting very<br />2 potent anti-platelet drugs. Most hospitals don't<br />3 have a way to test for the effect of those drugs.<br />4 So, our diagnostic systems are: (a)<br />5 really not geared up, and (b) they are just<br />6 inefficient.<br />7 A big problem for me, because what happens<br />8 in many hospitals, is that the accountability for<br />9 blood use resides in the Pathology Department.<br />10 Now, wait a minute. I don't write the orders for<br />11 the blood, the physician that is caring for the<br />12 patient writes the order, so there are problems in<br />13 terms of having really an accountable situation for<br />14 the person that is prescribing the blood<br />15 transfusion.<br />16 There have been some interesting<br />17 approaches to that, that other centers have had,<br />18 such as indexing physicians related to blood<br />19 utilization, but that again is the exception rather<br />20 than the rule.<br />21 Clinicians--and when I say "clinicians," I<br />22 am taking in the broad sense, I am talking about<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (176 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />177<br />1 nurses, and I am talking about physicians--are<br />2 poorly trained in transfusion medicine.<br />3 If you look in an ICU, and you ask a nurse<br />4 about dose of dopamine or how to deliver dopamine,<br />5 they actually know more than many of the early<br />6 trainees. If you ask them a few questions about<br />7 blood or blood transfusions or how to administer<br />8 blood, you often get sort of a blank look.<br />9 So, we really have I think an important<br />10 role to play in terms of enhancing the education of<br />11 those within the field.<br />12 Then, one real pet peeve of mine is that<br />13 there are resources that the AABB has put together<br />14 and various other organizations, but those<br />15 resources aren't getting to the end user.<br />16 A classic example is the Circular of<br />17 Information. It is sort of a treasure trove of<br />18 facts and figures about how to use blood. Whenever<br />19 I show this to a surgical resident, you know, their<br />20 eyes light up. These things are unknown, they are<br />21 uncovered, so we have to figure out a way to get<br />22 those resources to the people that really need<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (177 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />178<br />1 them.<br />2 So, what I was thinking about, questions<br />3 along the lines of clinical practice, there are<br />4 several questions that came to mind.<br />5 One is--and one can demonstrate in the<br />6 short term when you publish a paper, that<br />7 educational efforts in fact do improve blood<br />8 transfusion--but the question that exists is how<br />9 durable is this and are we using the right<br />10 educational efforts, the ones that we are investing<br />11 in today.<br />12 The second is, you know, this is the world<br />13 or this is the time now of benchmarking. One thing<br />14 that my hospital, and I am sure all hospitals pay<br />15 attention to right now, is where they are<br />16 benchmarked, and the benchmarking is largely<br />17 related to certain outcome measures.<br />18 In fact, one of the benchmarks is<br />19 bleeding, for example, for cardiac surgery, but is<br />20 there some way to tie in transfusion to this<br />21 benchmarking activity, and can that in some way<br />22 improve performance or practice or blood<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (178 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />179<br />1 utilization.<br />2 I read recently a trial, the PACMAN trial,<br />3 which is a trial of patients using pulmonary artery<br />4 catheters, and there was an editorial to it, which<br />5 I found very interesting.<br />6 In the editorial, it said, well, even<br />7 though there are clinical trials that prove a given<br />8 point, what is it that will make the practitioner<br />9 actually pay attention to that trial and adopt the<br />10 finding of the trial, the point being that the<br />11 people that perform trials and read the literature,<br />12 that is one group, but there is whole other<br />13 universe of people out there.<br />14 So, the question is how do you get that<br />15 information, when you have the trial, how do you<br />16 best disseminate it to impact practice.<br />17 Another element is, is the blood community<br />18 really effective in implementing change, and by<br />19 that, what I mean is are we insiders or are we<br />20 outsiders. I was really very much impressed by a<br />21 statement that was made.<br />22 I was at an international meeting in<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (179 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />180<br />1 hematology, and a well-known figure in platelet<br />2 function--the discussion was, you know, what sort<br />3 of tests one would order in advance of surgery--and<br />4 the point that was made is that, you know, whatever<br />5 this individual said, or people that were sort of<br />6 outside of the sphere of a given area of practice,<br />7 was largely ignored.<br />8 So, the question is how can people within<br />9 transfusion get out of a shell and begin to branch<br />10 out to the other prescribers or users of blood.<br />11 Last, is what really is appropriate role<br />12 for government in enhancing transfusion practice.<br />13 It is interesting because, you know, there is this,<br />14 well, this is the practice of medicine, so the<br />15 government should not interfere with the practice<br />16 of medicine, but on the other hand, if there are<br />17 practices that aren't optimal, that impact safety<br />18 and that impact availability, then, should the<br />19 government get involved.<br />20 So, I would end with that in terms of my<br />21 considerations, in terms of practice. I think<br />22 there is much to be done, and one thing that I<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (180 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />181<br />1 didn't mention is that there are governments where<br />2 this is now evolving after the vCJD issue in the<br />3 UK. There is a huge effort there to impact<br />4 practice in blood utilization.<br />5 So, I will stop with that and open up for<br />6 questions.<br />7 DR. BRECHER: Content questions?<br />8 [No response.]<br />9 DR. BRECHER: Okay. Thank you, Art.<br />10 We are now going to move to the Research<br />11 Agenda.

I<br />8 have said here that research in blood banking and<br />9 transfusion medicine from the safety point of view<br />10 is particularly strong in certain areas. An<br />11 example is red cell immunohematology and<br />12 transfusion-transmitted diseases.<br />13 From the point of view of availability,<br />14 there certainly have been investigators, and Jane<br />15 Piliavin is somebody that came to mind who made<br />16 important contributions here, that research is much<br />17 less focused on an understanding of pro-social<br />18 behavior, on altruism, and on motivation.<br />19 As far as our national inventory is<br />20 concerned, we seem to lurch between surplus and<br />21 insufficiency, and at the moment, our inventories<br />22 are full as a result of the outpouring from the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (182 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />183<br />1 community in response to Katrina, but we do know<br />2 from emerging evidence that crisis responders are<br />3 not the individuals who are promptly converted to<br />4 regular donors.<br />5 We have been saying for something like 40<br />6 years now that something like 60 percent of<br />7 individuals are eligible, but only 5 percent do<br />8 donate, and so long as we persist with that lament,<br />9 as long as we have been doing that, we really<br />10 haven't been assured of a stable inventory.<br />11 I think that is just a reflection of our<br />12 ignorance as to what the key elements are in<br />13 understanding behavior, pro-social behavior, and<br />14 motivation.<br />15 So, there is this disproportionate<br />16 emphasis then, and it was really revealed by a<br />17 review of the research issues that were discussed<br />18 at recent meetings here. I have listed some of<br />19 those issues - optimal treatment for rare blood<br />20 disorders, bacterial contamination, the risk of<br />21 transfusion-related acute lung injury, universal<br />22 leukoreduction, mad cow disease, HHV-8, babesiosis,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (183 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />184<br />1 Chagas, pathogen inactivation, and the risk of<br />2 contamination of the blood supply with bioterror<br />3 agents.<br />4 I don't want my remarks to be construed as<br />5 criticism of anyone who would want to eliminate<br />6 even the remotest risk associated with transfusion,<br />7 but we really do need to develop a script that<br />8 addresses the common, as well as the rare.<br />9 We have heard even today, take Chagas, for<br />10 example, that this is a quote, "unmet" challenge,<br />11 but are seven cases in the United States and Canada<br />12 since 1987 really of such dire consequence that we<br />13 could label that risk as an unmet challenge.<br />14 I mean that is one case every two or three<br />15 years. It does reflect, though, the devotion to<br />16 research that is intended to further reduce the<br />17 risk of transfusion-transmitted infection, and<br />18 while we are witnessing that drive to the zero risk<br />19 blood supply, the major contributor to fatalities<br />20 associated with transfusion has really not enjoyed<br />21 the same research intensity, and patient<br />22 misidentification persists and patient<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (184 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />185<br />1 misidentification accounts for more acute deaths<br />2 than all the other transfusion-transmitted<br />3 infections combined.<br />4 So, why does that risk persist? It may be<br />5 that we are just not good at multi-disciplinary<br />6 approaches. How do we bring together hospital<br />7 administration, nursing, information management,<br />8 physicians, pharmacy, the blood bank?<br />9 As far as the availability is concerned,<br />10 if maintaining availability is going to earn equal<br />11 research attention, then, recruitment needs to be<br />12 based on an understanding of donor behavior.<br />13 I don't want to sound melodramatic, but<br />14 when the patient says, "Is my transfusion safe,"<br />15 the patient has to be reassured, first, that the<br />16 blood is going to be available should he or she<br />17 need it, and that, secondly, we have to respond to<br />18 the question about safety with, well, we have to be<br />19 assured that we are not going to confuse you with<br />20 some other equally deserving recipient.<br />21 In fact, this committee actually had a<br />22 recommendation which goes back to January of 2003,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (185 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />186<br />1 urging the Secretary to take steps to encourage and<br />2 facilitate implementation of measures that could<br />3 prevent errors in the transfusion setting.<br />4 So, here are a couple of questions, then,<br />5 to consider, just at a very plodding level.<br />6 Should the Department encourage research<br />7 into systems that would ensure something as simple<br />8 as the right unit of blood goes to the right<br />9 patient?<br />10 It might have been a little more<br />11 intellectually satisfying to have worded that<br />12 question along the lines of should research be<br />13 encouraged to ensure that the common risks are<br />14 addressed, as well as the esoteric.<br />15 Having dealt with the safety side of<br />16 things, then, the other question to consider is:<br />17 Should the Department encourage interdisciplinary<br />18 approaches to understanding altruism?<br />19 I am afraid that if we don't understand<br />20 altruism, we are going to have the pitfalls and the<br />21 troughs in the national blood supply, and an<br />22 interdisciplinary approach would achieve something<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (186 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />187<br />1 that we have not really achieved well, and that is<br />2 bringing together the sociologists, the behavioral<br />3 psychologists, the motivational psychologists, and<br />4 those individuals that would help us understand<br />5 what really is behind the active volunteer<br />6 donation.<br />7 End of sermon. Thanks.<br />8 DR. BRECHER: Questions for Merlyn?<br />9 [No response.]<br />10 DR. BRECHER: Then, we are going to move<br />11 on to Disaster Planning. Dr. Sue Roseff.<br />12 Disaster Planning<br />13 DR. ROSEFF: I am here to discuss disaster<br />14 planning, and I am at a little bit of a<br />15 disadvantage since I just joined the committee at<br />16 the last meeting, and there were extensive<br />17 discussions about disaster planning after September<br />18 11th, so I am relying on a little help from my<br />19 friends.<br />20 I want to thank Jerry and Mark and Karen<br />21 for supplying me with much of the information I<br />22 will be discussing. I would also like to invite<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (187 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />188<br />1 the members of the committee who were here or<br />2 anyone else involved in the discussions to feel<br />3 free to add anything that I have omitted or changed<br />4 the focus of what I am discussing.<br />5 After the September 11th attacks, the<br />6 Interorganizational Task Force on Domestic<br />7 Disasters and Acts of Terrorism was formed in<br />8 December 2001 in order to develop a response plan<br />9 for future national disasters.<br />10 One of their charges and one of the things<br />11 that they felt was important was to have a smooth<br />12 process in place for blood collection efforts, and<br />13 as we all know, after September 11th, we lost a<br />14 great deal of trust with the public and donors<br />15 after it was discovered that much of the blood that<br />16 was collected, or not much, but a certain amount of<br />17 it was thrown out and never used.<br />18 So, therefore, it was very important,<br />19 according to this task force, that we develop a<br />20 policy that would allow a central coordinating<br />21 effort to give a consistent message to all blood<br />22 donors and to the public.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (188 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT</p><p>189<br />1 They also recognized a need for a national<br />2 inventory management program, and Southwest talked<br />3 about this in a little bit of detail, and again,<br />4 the question of should this be a 5- to 7-day<br />5 inventory, and also the importance of having<br />6 adequate inventories at all times in order to<br />7 respond to disasters.<br />8 As we know, the blood that is used at the<br />9 time of a disaster is not the blood that is<br />10 collected the next day. It is the blood from donors<br />11 who have donated to maintain the supply up to that<br />12 point. So, therefore, the question was do we need<br />13 to encourage this in some form to have a supply<br />14 that will be there in case of a disaster, not after<br />15 the disaster.<br />16 Finally, the AABB was tasked with<br />17 coordinating this entity, and I have listed here<br />18 the alphabet soup of organizations that are<br />19 involved in the task force.<br />20 After September 11th, in the winter of<br />21 2002, this committee met, and their task was to<br />22 look at lessons learned after September 11th, and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (189 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />190<br />1 ask can we strengthen the safety and availability<br />2 of the United States blood supply.<br />3 As a result of the meeting, the committee<br />4 then wrote a letter to then Secretary Thompson and<br />5 brought up the following points. First, the<br />6 committee endorsed the role of the AABB Task Force.<br />7 They also recommended the incorporation of<br />8 the task force recommendations and members into<br />9 some of the federal structure that is involved in<br />10 disaster response, so that there would be a more<br />11 coordinated effort.<br />12 Again, they discussed the need to build<br />13 blood reserves and to have a system that monitored<br />14 blood availability on an ongoing basis, so we could<br />15 detect if there were shortages that might affect<br />16 the need or the ability to respond to a disaster.<br />17 In addition, they discussed the importance<br />18 of an infrastructure for transportation in times<br />19 when a certain part of the country is affected, how<br />20 can we move blood around, how can we move reagents<br />21 around, how can we move testing around in order to<br />22 meet needs, the need for an integrated<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (190 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />191<br />1 communication facility or group, so that again, we<br />2 get a consistent message out that is able to speak<br />3 to all the stakeholders during these times of<br />4 disaster.<br />5 Also, redundancy. We need to have<br />6 redundancy in case, of course, certain parts of the<br />7 country are destroyed and the capability of<br />8 collecting, transporting, and testing blood can't<br />9 be done in one region, we need to obviously be able<br />10 to move that very rapidly, so that there isn't a<br />11 loss of resources at that time.<br />12 Also, it was recommended that if there are<br />13 any regulatory revisions, either permanent or<br />14 temporary, that these should only be addressed in<br />15 terms of what was needed for patient care at the<br />16 time.<br />17 As part of this letter, too, the committee<br />18 recommended to the Secretary that blood donors be<br />19 considered a national resource.<br />20 Finally, some questions to consider for<br />21 discussion. Should disaster planning be part of<br />22 any kind of strategic plan that this committee<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (191 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />192<br />1 comes up with? What is the current role of the<br />2 AABB Interorganizational Task Force on Domestic<br />3 Disasters and Acts of Terrorism?<br />4 One thing I would like to add is that<br />5 during Katrina, we did have a good, consistent<br />6 message about blood, the need for blood or the lack<br />7 of need for blood, and we didn't see the same<br />8 rushing to blood centers of donors as we saw after<br />9 9/11, so that was very effective.<br />10 Also, is the structure of the task force<br />11 and its funding adequate currently? Is there<br />12 currently a structure in place to move resources in<br />13 times of disaster, and is what is the status<br />14 currently of a national blood reserve?<br />15 DR. BRECHER: Content questions or<br />16 comments besides the open question of what reserve?<br />17 Maybe this might be a good time to get an<br />18 update on the Interorganizational Task Force.<br />19 Maybe Karen might say something about that.<br />20 MS. LIPTON: Yes. Well, we were operative<br />21 during Katrina and most of our issues I think were<br />22 trying to help our facilities that were affected<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (192 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />193<br />1 physically in the area to deal with some of the<br />2 issues.<br />3 We don't have a full report because our<br />4 usual process is we actually afterwards go through<br />5 a whole process of evaluating. I will see that I<br />6 think one of the things that did happen is, because<br />7 the other problems were so immense and so<br />8 overwhelming, that I believe it was a little bit<br />9 difficult at times for us to get the attention that<br />10 we needed, and we didn't have massive amounts of<br />11 blood required, but we did have ongoing operations<br />12 for some of the centers that were affected.<br />13 So, we will promise to bring back a full<br />14 report at the next meeting, if that is all right<br />15 with you.<br />16 DR. BRECHER: One other quick question.<br />17 What if the hurricane had hit Washington? The<br />18 Interorganizational Task Force is basically run out<br />19 of AABB, is there provision for an alternate site?<br />20 MS. LIPTON: Well, one of the issues<br />21 related to that, that we have been struggling with,<br />22 is trying to get enough money for redundant<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (193 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />194<br />1 resources within AABB. We have a server that is in<br />2 Virginia, but we do have to worry about, if one of<br />3 those servers goes down, how do we communicate with<br />4 everyone else.<br />5 We are not as much people dependent in the<br />6 sense that we have people all over the country, and<br />7 actually, in different parts of the world, who<br />8 could step into the position of being a<br />9 communication person and the point person, but I do<br />10 think that the systems are the things that we need<br />11 to worry about, and we need to worry about<br />12 redundancy.<br />13 We have not gotten any funding for this<br />14 activity, as you probably all know, so it is really<br />15 something that the blood organizations and the AABB<br />16 do on top of everything else that we do, but we<br />17 have been in dialogue with the Department, and I<br />18 think they understand our needs, and we will<br />19 continue to work on the issue.<br />20 DR.

DUBIN: Our thanks to Jerry, the<br />7 committee, for getting the opportunity to speak. I<br />8 am Corey Dubin of the Committee of Ten Thousand. I<br />9 think what makes us unique in the process is we<br />10 have been around since the beginning, previous to<br />11 this committee. It was the committee of Ten<br />12 Thousand that approaches Senators Graham and<br />13 Kennedy, which resulted in the IOM study.<br />14 We asked for a congressional<br />15 investigation. They gave us the IOM study. It<br />16 turned out to be a very good one and a very wise<br />17 choice on their part. We were around for the<br />18 founding of the committee, and we have been here<br />19 throughout the process.<br />20 Our comments today are rooted in our<br />21 perceptions and our board of directors' and<br />22 community's perception, and distinct from the NHF<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (195 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />196<br />1 or other hemophilia organizations, our primary<br />2 constituency is those infected with HIV and HCV<br />3 from tainted blood.<br />4 We really grew out of the disaster. We<br />5 grew out of services not being available. We<br />6 started as a support group.<br />7 The IOM recommendation establishing this<br />8 committee talked about interagency coordination, it<br />9 talked about coordinating the federal response, and<br />10 those are things that we think are very important.<br />11 We saw that as the mission of the committee, and we<br />12 saw the committee's client as the Secretary of HHS,<br />13 Health and Human Services.<br />14 The question our board would raise today<br />15 is, if we would all agree that the client of this<br />16 committee is the Secretary, has there been a<br />17 breakdown in recent years between the committee and<br />18 the Secretary, has the value of this committee and<br />19 what this committee brings to the table been lost<br />20 on seniors at HHS, are seniors at HHS clear about<br />21 what this committee is about and what it can do.<br />22 We think it is a unique history of this<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (196 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />197<br />1 committee, a history born of the epidemic, born of<br />2 everyone's frustration, and as a result of that<br />3 frustration, a willingness to think out of the box,<br />4 to do things different.<br />5 Our board this past week asked the<br />6 question do seniors at HHS understand that unique<br />7 history and what was accomplished between<br />8 government and all of the stakeholders - industry,<br />9 community, Red Cross, the public health structure,<br />10 and we continue to question that, and we believe<br />11 that it's most important to nurture the all<br />12 stakeholders' grass roots community participation<br />13 model.<br />14 We think that that is the model is what is<br />15 in trouble right now. We are concerned that the<br />16 trust we had, and continue to have at this level,<br />17 may not be shared above, and it may just be a<br />18 question of understanding that history.<br />19 It is our hope that it is not that that<br />20 history is not valued in this particular historical<br />21 period, but that it is not understood.<br />22 We are also concerned that the question of<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (197 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />198<br />1 keeping our eyes on the prize has also been a<br />2 problem, that we have drifted.

The IOM<br />11 report worked because it stressed the work between<br />12 communities. The establishment of the ACBSA and<br />13 the presence of grass-roots community<br />14 representatives at the table worked.<br />15 Those were some fairly heady days in '96,<br />16 '97, '98.

I heard<br />4 talk of acceptable risk or risk communication<br />5 today. None of us communicated about the risk of<br />6 hepatitis C. Decisions were made probably in the<br />7 1960s that resulted in hepatitis C as being seen as<br />8 an acceptable risk.<br />9 I can tell you, as those of you that know<br />10 me know, it is not an acceptable risk. I have<br />11 lived with it for 35 years, and I am in pretty good<br />12 shape.

To all of you that are<br />6 parents, that is my little girl, that is my<br />7 youngest daughter. That is her quote. I have a<br />8 hard time not coming to tears when I look at that,<br />9 because unlike my twins, who are 32, she never had<br />10 me without HIV hanging over us.<br />11 The twins never thought hemophilia would<br />12 kill me, they figured he will bleed, he will hurt,<br />13 but when we talk, they say we never thought you<br />14 would die until we were 13 and you told us.

I<br />3 told our board I do believe this is a committee cut<br />4 off from its client, and I don't think it's the<br />5 committee's fault.<br />6 I told the board I thought the committee<br />7 was being a bit insular when I saw the words<br />8 "strategic planning." In my seven years on the<br />9 California Prevention Committee, I had the honor of<br />10 working with Patricia Franks, Ph.D., heads up<br />11 strategic planning for the University of<br />12 California, and is a brilliant woman, and I had the<br />13 honor of her deciding that she liked me and saying<br />14 stick with me and you will learn a lot about<br />15 planning.<br />16 Well, I did, and for seven years, from<br />17 being a chair to a committee chair, I learned about<br />18 strategic planning. I have seen the word<br />19 "strategic" today, but I haven't seen the meat of<br />20 what strategic planning is really all about.<br />21 I feel, and this is more a feel comment,<br />22 the committee feels like it doesn't believe it has<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (210 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />211<br />1 the power to change things, and granted, from our<br />2 perspective, we have had two clients, two<br />3 Secretaries of Health, that didn't seem as<br />4 interested as Dr. Shalala was in these issues, and<br />5 we have all had a rough time trying to keep health<br />6 on the agenda.<br />7 But I think what is lacking is leadership,<br />8 leadership about these issues, leadership about<br />9 strategic planning. The discussion I heard about<br />10 IVIG this morning, about immune globulins, I<br />11 mentioned to Marsha Boyle, we had that discussion<br />12 in 1998, when the committee was meeting I think<br />13 right on the Rockville Pike at one of the other<br />14 hotels.<br />15 Those discussions were deep. That is when<br />16 everybody was upset that some of the home care<br />17 companies may have been hoarding or manipulating<br />18 supply. They were incredibly contentious meetings.<br />19 Where have we come since '98 on this issue, why are<br />20 we still talking about allocation of IVIG and<br />21 supply?<br />22 If we are really strategic planning, then,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (211 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />212<br />1 we are going to develop a plan that we pray is a<br />2 national blood policy and addresses these issues<br />3 now, so we are not reactive, we are not reacting to<br />4 a crisis, we are not reacting to a situation, we<br />5 have this overall plan for the nation.<br />6 How important is blood to this nation? I<br />7 can't answer that, but I think we have got to<br />8 strive harder to find out together. The committee<br />9 has to believe it can make change, and we have to<br />10 believe that we can work with you to do it, and if<br />11 that means those of us in hemophilia that did it<br />12 for the Ricky Ray bill back on the Hill, and beat<br />13 the pavement until we get a response, we are ready<br />14 to do that, but we need an ally.<br />15 We need an associate, someone to work<br />16 with, and we are not always going to agree on<br />17 everything, but I think we do agree that a national<br />18 policy is called for, and a nation of this size,<br />19 the world's leading nation does not have a national<br />20 blood policy.<br />21 I am not sure how you all feel about that,<br />22 but we continue to be shocked by that, and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (212 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />213<br />1 frustrated and ready to go do what we need to do to<br />2 make it happen, because at the end of the day, even<br />3 if she wasn't my daughter, I would want to do<br />4 something about it, but the fact that she's my<br />5 daughter makes it all the more critical that I have<br />6 some answers if she has a son with hemophilia.<br />7 So, I urge the committee to look at some<br />8 of these issues. I again thank you, Jerry, for the<br />9 time, and everyone else on the committee for<br />10 listening, and we are always appreciative to be a<br />11 part of this process, and have been here since the<br />12 beginning, and we will continue to be here.<br />13 The only issue is can we find enough young<br />14 people to reinvent ourselves and mentor ourselves,<br />15 because coming in today, I was saying, well, I was<br />16 a young turk 15 years ago coming in here, and now I<br />17 am getting to be an old man. It's a little scary.<br />18 Thank you very much. I really appreciate<br />19 your attention and your consideration.<br />20 DR. BRECHER: Any questions or comments<br />21 for Corey?<br />22 Okay. Thank you, Corey.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (213 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />214<br />1 Are there any other public comments at<br />2 this time?<br />3 Committee Discussion<br />4 DR. BRECHER: If not, we can begin sort of<br />5 our committee discussion. We have several things<br />6 we can talk about. We can go back to IVIG from<br />7 this morning. We can talk about the strategic<br />8 plan. I think it is probably worth spending a few<br />9 minutes talking about what Corey has just<br />10 discussed.<br />11 So, what is the committee's pleasure,<br />12 where would we like to begin? Let's talk about<br />13 some of the issues that Corey has brought up first.<br />14 I think we can move that off the table first.<br />15 I think that his committee's perception<br />16 that the senior management at HHS is not<br />17 particularly paying attention to this committee is<br />18 an interesting observation. I was wondering if the<br />19 other consumer groups have that same feeling.<br />20 Maybe Mark for the National Hemophilia?<br />21 MR. SKINNER: Well, Paul is actually<br />22 president of NHF now.

Paul, go right<br />2 ahead.<br />3 DR. HAAS: I guess I am a little sorry to<br />4 admit that we haven't had this discussion as an<br />5 organization, but I personally would agree with<br />6 what I heard Corey say.<br />7 MR. SKINNER: The only comment that I<br />8 would add is i mean I think the committee in<br />9 general was extremely disappointed a couple of<br />10 years ago with the silence when we put committee<br />11 recommendations forward and we weren't getting<br />12 formal responses.<br />13 I do think that has changed, that we are<br />14 getting responses. Whether they are actually<br />15 translating into the actions that the committee had<br />16 contemplated, I think there is something still<br />17 missing there, but at least we are getting an<br />18 acknowledgment that we put a recommendation<br />19 forward, and there was a period where that wasn't<br />20 even occurring.<br />21 DR. BRECHER: Additional comments?<br />22 Why don't we move to the IVIG question. I<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (215 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />216<br />1 am sorry, Jerry?<br />2 DR. SANDLER: I will give a personal<br />3 opinion that when we had a movement toward a<br />4 national blood policy, I had the feeling that the<br />5 Assistant Secretary of Health was given the charge<br />6 of a leadership position.<br />7 I don't see any leadership coming in this<br />8 area transfusion safety from above. I think we are<br />9 more engaged with them with Jerry Holmberg's<br />10 initiatives than we ever have been, and we are<br />11 exchanging an awful lot of communication,<br />12 recommendations, and we get the most wonderful<br />13 blowoffs I have ever seen, but I don't believe that<br />14 there is any major leadership in blood safety and<br />15 availability coming from above.<br />16 They are responsive to our initiatives<br />17 with communications that haven't taken a leadership<br />18 position.<br />19 DR.

BIANCO: I am going to say what Jerry<br />2 said, but from a different perspective. I don't<br />3 think that the Secretary or HHS understands the<br />4 role of this committee. It has been a long time<br />5 between the IOM report and what the committee was<br />6 designed to do today, and I think that we are just<br />7 one of the committees that raises issues, comes<br />8 with points, but I don't understand that they see<br />9 the importance of what we do, and this is my last<br />10 meeting, so it's okay, I can say that.<br />11 DR. BRECHER: That's what you think,<br />12 Celso.<br />13 MR. SKINNER: I just want to make one<br />14 other comment, because I do think Corey's comments<br />15 were very timely, and sometimes silence can be<br />16 misinterpreted either as agreement or disagreement,<br />17 and I think Corey's comments, particularly at a<br />18 time when we are talking about strategic planning,<br />19 bringing the committee back to why we were<br />20 originally created and for who we were originally<br />21 created is extremely important.<br />22 I mean there was very much a compelling<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (217 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />218<br />1 need for the committee at the time we were created,<br />2 and the IOM study gave us that blueprint, and we<br />3 have been struggling with what is that blueprint<br />4 that we are working through an agenda, so we take<br />5 up a series of ad-hoc issues which are very<br />6 important, and we have drifted from perhaps that<br />7 original rallying cause that brought us all<br />8 together.<br />9 It may be a natural evolution, but the<br />10 purpose of why we exist, I mean also comes from the<br />11 top down. It came from the outside in, and it was<br />12 created through the IOM study, and now keeping that<br />13 agenda focused.<br />14 So, hopefully, through this kind of<br />15 strategic planning process, we are going to be able<br />16 to get back to a template of issues then that we<br />17 are going to be able to work through, but I think<br />18 that is what has been missing, is that overriding<br />19 theme that has compelled us from each meeting to<br />20 meeting.<br />21 DR.

BRECHER: Sue.<br />15 DR. ROSEFF: I have one question and a<br />16 comment.<br />17 First of all, what is the ability of the<br />18 committee to do something when we feel we are not<br />19 being listened to? We may talk about this<br />20 tomorrow, but with IGIV, we have seen that nothing<br />21 has changed since our last meeting, and there is<br />22 concern that things are going to get worse in<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (219 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />220<br />1 January, and we have got no response from the<br />2 Assistant Secretary, so my first question is, well,<br />3 what do we do.<br />4 My second comment is basically I am<br />5 thankful that one of the issues that didn't come up<br />6 during Katrina was that there wasn't a blood<br />7 availability issue, but in a way, that sort of puts<br />8 blood in the background again.<br />9 I think what we are always doing is<br />10 responding to the disaster, and the hope is that<br />11 with the strategic plan, that we will not be<br />12 responding to a disaster, that we will have<br />13 something in place to be proactive.<br />14 So, I think it is our job to keep the<br />15 level of the blood supply, availability and safety<br />16 high on the agenda because again, I don't hear as<br />17 much about it as I did after September 11th,<br />18 because it doesn't seem that that has come up to<br />19 the same intensity.<br />20 So, first, my question is about what do we<br />21 do, and, second, is just a comment that I think<br />22 that the level of looking at the blood supply keeps<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (220 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />221<br />1 dropping when there is not a big disaster upon us<br />2 that is affecting the blood supply.<br />3 DR.

It is true that the committee was<br />7 established in the wake of the IOM report about<br />8 decision-making in the HIV era.<br />9 It is also true that the IOM<br />10 recommendation was for the establishment of an<br />11 advisory council to the Secretary or to the<br />12 Department, and I think we need to remember that<br />13 the committee serves at the pleasure of the<br />14 Department and that essentially, the Department<br />15 decides that on which it wishes to be advised.<br />16 I think that the paradox and the tension<br />17 comes from the fact that the committee members<br />18 realize that they also need to lead the charge,<br />19 that they are not there just to answer the<br />20 questions posed by the Department, but that they<br />21 have taken upon themselves, or the committee has<br />22 taken upon itself a role of sort of taking a<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (221 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />222<br />1 birdseye view and being more proactive on issues.<br />2 I am just not sure that that role and<br />3 mission is what is central to the committee<br />4 charter, and I think that is part of where the<br />5 tension comes from.<br />6 On the question is whether the committee<br />7 is effective, you know, we have had a number of<br />8 meetings where we have reviewed recommendations and<br />9 outcomes of recommendations, and I think that what<br />10 you really have is sort of a good news/bad news<br />11 story, that on some issues we have been able to<br />12 prompt quite a bit of response in not just<br />13 government, but also the private sector, and then<br />14 on other issues, there has been frustration because<br />15 we have not been able to see the outcomes that we<br />16 might have liked or the responses that we might<br />17 have liked.<br />18 But I guess my view is just a little bit<br />19 more colored because I just don't see it as all of<br />20 one stripe. I simply think we have had our<br />21 successes and failures.<br />22 DR. BRECHER: I would tend to agree with<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (222 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />223<br />1 you, Jay. I think just in the last few years, the<br />2 Interorganizational Task Force, I think it has been<br />3 a success partly from this committee. I think a<br />4 lot of the issues over bacterial testing were<br />5 worked out in this committee. HCV lookback years<br />6 ago came through this committee.<br />7 So, I think there have been a lot of<br />8 successes, a lot of issues of reimbursement have<br />9 come out of this committee. Not all of them have<br />10 been resolved to the satisfaction of everyone, but<br />11 at least it has been in the avenue of getting those<br />12 opinions out there.<br />13 Any further comments or questions? Paul.<br />14 DR. HAAS: It's half a question and half a<br />15 comment, I guess. I think a major part of what<br />16 Corey was just saying to us was how do we, as a<br />17 committee, or maybe the Secretary, receive this<br />18 information from the grass roots.<br />19 I think as much as I agree with what I<br />20 heard Jay just say, and you have just said, in<br />21 terms of some successes, again, I am going to be a<br />22 little repetitive here, but the intensity of the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (223 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />224<br />1 original committee meetings, of which I guess I am<br />2 one of the few that is still here, that has<br />3 changed, and maybe that's good, but as it has<br />4 changed, I will use Mark's term, the focus of what<br />5 this committee is doing I think has changed.<br />6 Without the crisis out there, as we had<br />7 with AIDS first, and then understanding hepatitis,<br />8 what can we, as a committee, generate that type of<br />9 focus again, so that we have that type of--I won't<br />10 say the word excitement--that we had in the earlier<br />11 years, and I don't know if we can do that, but I<br />12 think it is an important part of I think what I see<br />13 this committee doing is keeping aware of those<br />14 issues just like the IVIG business coming through<br />15 here, and we want to stay focused on that.<br />16 DR. BRECHER: Yes, it is sort of like do<br />17 we really want to live in interesting times.<br />18 Other comments, questions? Merlyn.<br />19 DR. SAYERS: Corey and I go back to the<br />20 circumstances that you were talking about when<br />21 tension filled the air, and an urgent need to be<br />22 active was felt by everybody.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (224 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />225<br />1 I think one of the things that has<br />2 happened during the embryology of this committee is<br />3 that the sense of urgency has been reduced largely<br />4 because of gains in transfusion safety.<br />5 When we were talking about<br />6 transfusion-transmitted HIV, there was an<br />7 understandable national anxiety. It is not as easy<br />8 to develop as much energy talking about<br />9 transfusion-transmitted ehrlichiosis.<br />10 I think that is one of the sets of<br />11 circumstances which distinguishes our behavior now<br />12 from then. One other thing, Corey, and I have said<br />13 this to you before, when I have heard you talk, I<br />14 am sometimes left with the sense that somebody that<br />15 has an M.D. immediately has a net degree of filter,<br />16 which prevents him or her from understanding what<br />17 the issues are at the grass-roots level, and I<br />18 can't agree with that, essentially because many<br />19 physicians are themselves transfusion recipients<br />20 and dependent on transfusions, and many physicians<br />21 are treating physicians, and they certainly are<br />22 sympathetic, if not because they are transfusion<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (225 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />226<br />1 recipients themselves, but certainly because they<br />2 might be treating individuals who are transfusion<br />3 dependent.<br />4 So, I don't think an M.D. degree or Ph.D.<br />5 degree really superimposes some sort of censure on<br />6 your understandings.<br />7 DR. BRECHER: Art.<br />8 DR. BRACEY: One of the things that I have<br />9 just been thinking about as we have had this<br />10 discussion, clearly, what sparked this was adverse<br />11 outcomes released to transfusion, but the other<br />12 reality is that blood is to medicine as oil is to<br />13 armies. You can't fight a war without oil. There<br />14 are many things that you can't do in medicine<br />15 without an adequate blood supply.<br />16 I would think that the higher ups, if they<br />17 began to have some sort of strategic vision, would<br />18 see this and therefore would see that the work of<br />19 this committee, perhaps, you know, they are focused<br />20 on its origin as opposed to other possible<br />21 destinations, so again, to me, I think the key now<br />22 is to look at blood as a resource and to begin to<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (226 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />227<br />1 focus on the good things that it can do and the<br />2 needs.<br />3 You know, we are in an era of advancing<br />4 aggressive medical therapies. We won't be able to<br />5 provide those therapies if we have an inadequate<br />6 supply. This is something that I think that the<br />7 higher ups would understand.<br />8 DR. BRECHER: Unfortunately, sometimes it<br />9 seems like you have to have a headline in the<br />10 Washington Post of the New York Times to get their<br />11 attention.<br />12 Jay.<br />13 DR. EPSTEIN: I tend to think that it's a<br />14 good thing that the committee has evolved to taking<br />15 a global perspective about our system as a whole<br />16 and how it works in all its parts. I think that we<br />17 are in a position to do more long-term good from<br />18 that perspective than dealing, you know, urgently<br />19 and in a crisis mode with particular issues that<br />20 are pressing, not that that is unimportant when<br />21 important issues are pressing, we deal with them,<br />22 and we should, but isn't it a good thing to be able<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (227 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />228<br />1 to take a step back and ask what are the problems<br />2 with our system and how can we make our system run<br />3 better.<br />4 The second point I would make is that a<br />5 strategic plan for the Department to undertake<br />6 shouldn't be thought synonymous with a strategic<br />7 plan for the committee. I think it's an open<br />8 question what role this committee is advisory to<br />9 the Secretary should play in any such plan should<br />10 it emerge. It is not at all clear to me that it's<br />11 a plan that the committee should assemble, or the<br />12 committee should oversee, or the committee should<br />13 try to establish. I tend to think not.<br />14 Lastly, I think that Corey has again<br />15 reminded us of a very important thing, which is<br />16 that we shouldn't be out in the ozone, that the<br />17 concerns of the patients and the product end users<br />18 are our core business, and I think that is correct,<br />19 and I think that if we approach the development of<br />20 a strategic plan, it can't be in a vacuum. It has<br />21 got to be with a very real-world consideration of<br />22 how are people being affected in their daily lives<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (228 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />229<br />1 by what we are doing with the U.S. blood system and<br />2 all its elements.<br />3 So, you know, I resonate to that very<br />4 strongly, and I agree that the empowerment of the<br />5 consumer community, the patient community, and the<br />6 advisory committee processes has been a tremendous<br />7 advancement in public policy.<br />8 I think that we don't want to lose that<br />9 element even if we now find ourselves, you know,<br />10 speaking calmly.<br />11 DR. BRECHER: Celso.<br />12 DR. BIANCO: Corey woke us up, and I think<br />13 that this is a wonderful opportunity, coinciding<br />14 with what we think now in terms of a strategic<br />15 plan.<br />16 I slightly disagree with Jay on who should<br />17 conduct such an effort, not necessarily the<br />18 day-to-day of getting days and nights talking about<br />19 the actual strategic plan, but I think that it is<br />20 necessary. This committee is supposed to set<br />21 national policy in blood, and it is necessary that<br />22 at least a guiding principle is the overall strokes<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (229 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />230<br />1 be set by this committee.<br />2 It, I believe represents a lot of the<br />3 people involved, is an open committee. There are<br />4 many patients in the committee. By the way, I am a<br />5 transfusion recipient and lots of units, and the<br />6 public has access to this committee. So, at least I<br />7 think that the effort that we had this morning,<br />8 even if possibly or probably we didn't hit all the<br />9 right keys, is an initial effort, and we have to<br />10 put out, not necessarily the answers, but all the<br />11 right questions.<br />12 We don't have to respond to emergencies<br />13 only. That is what we have done always in the<br />14 past. I think that we have to ask ourselves are<br />15 those questions going to help us if we answered<br />16 them to do things right in the future, and I think<br />17 that is our role.<br />18 DR. BRECHER: Other comments or questions<br />19 on the subject? Corey, we are listening. We have<br />20 been listening to you.<br />21 MR. DUBIN: Two things. Merlyn, I would<br />22 never draw a line. You protected me on the podium<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (230 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />231<br />1 when Paul Holland wanted to make a mess, and you<br />2 stepped up and said it wouldn't happen, and it is<br />3 not that I see a difference, because I don't,<br />4 because at the height of the crisis, you and I were<br />5 delivering a talk together when most people thought<br />6 we and you guys wouldn't talk to each other.<br />7 So, I didn't mean to juxtaposition it in<br />8 that way. I think we need to continue to work,<br />9 docs, us, researchers, CMS. Dr. Bowman, I would<br />10 love to hear more from you. I would love to<br />11 understand CMS better.<br />12 I look out. Jay, you know how I feel. I<br />13 think you are one of the best people out there in<br />14 the government, and it is not that I think the<br />15 committee should be the be-all, end-all, but I<br />16 think it screams for leadership, and I know there<br />17 is such good people at this table that know how to<br />18 lead - Celso, Jay. I mean I could go down the list<br />19 around the table.<br />20 So, I think we are calling for leadership.<br />21 Maybe guidance would be a better word, Jay, that<br />22 would be more comfortable, because I agree with<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (231 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />232<br />1 you. The Secretary can wave his or her hand, and<br />2 it's over. We know that, but we also think you all<br />3 have so much credibility in the game, so to speak,<br />4 and we are ready to do what we can to support that<br />5 with the Hill, and, look, we may be small, but we<br />6 accomplished something on the Hill nobody said we<br />7 could ever do, and together we did it, all of our<br />8 groups.<br />9 So, I think from us, it's just a call, and<br />10 I don't want to go back. Somebody said thank God,<br />11 it's not I think the dialogue of the late '80s and<br />12 '90s.<br />13 I don't want to go back to HIV, but there<br />14 are two crises out there. One is reimbursement,<br />15 and reimbursement is almost like the controlling<br />16 for allocation, and that is a crisis, and we are<br />17 all frightened about that, and hepatitis.<br />18 I really appreciate that you all<br />19 considered our words very carefully. That is clear<br />20 to us, and we will continue to be in the process as<br />21 long as we have got some breath going, and then<br />22 hopefully, my daughter will be standing up here,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (232 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />233<br />1 and she's tougher than I am, look out, but thank<br />2 you.<br />3 DR. BRECHER: Jan, did you want to say<br />4 something?<br />5 MS. HAMILTON: Thank you. I just wanted<br />6 to say several things were said this afternoon<br />7 about blood policy, and I was just trying to ask--I<br />8 can't remember how many years ago it was, but a<br />9 comment, I don't know, Celso, if it was you, or<br />10 somebody over here, said that this group should be<br />11 setting the blood policy.<br />12 I went to a meeting, I believe it was in<br />13 2000, if I am not mistaken, it was held by the CDC,<br />14 and a whole bunch of us sat in a room all day long<br />15 and talked about whether the national blood policy<br />16 needed to be updated, and nothing was done.<br />17 I sat here thinking why wasn't that being<br />18 done here. So, I think, if nothing else, you know,<br />19 I mean we support a lot of Corey's statements, and<br />20 things that Paul and Mark and everybody have said,<br />21 and I sat here and listened a lot of times when<br />22 this committee deliberated for long hours and never<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (233 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />234<br />1 got an answer from one meeting to the next, to the<br />2 next, from the Secretary.<br />3 I see that changing to some degree, and I<br />4 am delighted with that, but maybe that's a good<br />5 project for 2006 for this committee, is to look at<br />6 the national blood policy. I mean it still says<br />7 something about plasma, and doesn't go any farther<br />8 than that, and that is sad.<br />9 We should be talking about the future and<br />10 about the things that we have, instead of just<br />11 going back just to plasma. I think you are right,<br />12 whoever said it, this is the place for that to be.<br />13 DR. BIANCO: Jan, it hasn't been revised<br />14 in 35 years.<br />15 DR. BRECHER: Any other comments or<br />16 questions? Why don't we take a 15-minute<br />17 break.<br />18 [Recess.]<br />19 DR. BRECHER: Could the committee members<br />20 take their seats, please.<br />21 We have two major topics to cover of the<br />22 remainder of today and basically, all day tomorrow,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (234 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />235<br />1 and that is, number one, coming to some conclusion<br />2 about the message we want to put forward about<br />3 IVIG, and, number two, the strategic plan and<br />4 policies for mitigating adverse diseases and other<br />5 things that could come into the blood supply.<br />6 So, I would suggest that we start with the<br />7 IVIG question. We have made strong recommendations<br />8 from this committee to the Secretary on two<br />9 occasions. I think that they have heard the<br />10 message, although we do not see definitive action<br />11 as yet.<br />12 I see us as having two choices. One, we<br />13 can come up with yet another resolution; or, two,<br />14 in the letter to the Secretary, well, we are going<br />15 to almost certainly make some sort of resolution<br />16 about the strategic plan.<br />17 We could simply state that the committee<br />18 remains concerned or even gravely concerned<br />19 regarding availability and reimbursement for IVIG,<br />20 and request that policy alternatives be considered,<br />21 and that is not a resolution, but I think it would<br />22 get the message across.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (235 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />236<br />1 So, I would be interested in hearing<br />2 opinions.<br />3 Mark.<br />4 MR. SKINNER: I do think there is one<br />5 thing that is new since we last met. I mean other<br />6 than there is more information than that, you know,<br />7 the pricing system does not work to support the<br />8 needs of the patients, the reimbursement system,<br />9 but the piece that I honed in on in the Secretary's<br />10 response, in the April 8th letter, was that they<br />11 find that there is sufficient supplies available<br />12 for the patients and that is marketplace<br />13 adjustments.<br />14 I am not sure whether or not the<br />15 information that we have heard agrees that there<br />16 actually is a sufficient supply out there. If it<br />17 is sufficient, it undoubtedly is extremely tight,<br />18 and there isn't much margin. So, I think the word<br />19 "sufficient," probably is overly generous.<br />20 There may be a supply out there if you are<br />21 in the right place at the right time, but I think<br />22 the evidence is it is getting tighter, and I think<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (236 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />237<br />1 the new piece that we learned at this meeting, or<br />2 that has at least transpired since the last<br />3 meeting, we may have learned it before this<br />4 meeting, is that the companies have gone onto<br />5 allocation, which is further evidence that, in<br />6 fact, there is a supply problem. The companies<br />7 wouldn't have got into an allocation or a rationing<br />8 system in terms of the distribution of the product<br />9 if there was a supply problem.<br />10 So, the point that the Secretary came back<br />11 on, which I assume is the reason, then, that they<br />12 didn't choose to go forward with declaring a public<br />13 health crisis, was the supply piece.<br />14 So, my thought was that we should respond<br />15 by saying, you know, that there is, in fact, a<br />16 supply program, and it is further evidenced now by<br />17 what is happening in the marketplace in terms of<br />18 allocation, and then underscore and go back and ask<br />19 them to revisit the alternatives, which may include<br />20 declaring a public health emergency, so that we can<br />21 take short-term action until the reimbursement<br />22 pieces and the pricing and the data can catch up<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (237 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />238<br />1 with what is occurring in the marketplace.<br />2 DR. BRECHER: Paul.<br />3 DR. HAAS: This really follows on Mark's<br />4 point. I think another piece that was driven home<br />5 today was the issue of where the treatment is<br />6 taking place. It is shifting, and those of us that<br />7 are accustomed to home treatment type of<br />8 phenomenons know that that shift is not good for<br />9 the patient.<br />10 And then to your question, Mark, about<br />11 should we attach this concern onto another, if we<br />12 think the IVIG is a is a significant concern, and I<br />13 happen to think it is, I prefer separate messages.<br />14 DR. BRECHER: Art.<br />15 DR. BRACEY: One other part that concerned<br />16 me is that in terms of the shift, there is an<br />17 assumption that the shift will, in fact, occur, and<br />18 one of the things that I was thinking of is that<br />19 clearly, since there is the capability of<br />20 contacting places where this shift would occur,<br />21 i.e., at the hospital settings, et cetera, would be<br />22 to ensure that we are not working on an assumption,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (238 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />239<br />1 so that we would end up in a reactive mode, but if<br />2 we could sort of prospectively go out and find out<br />3 if, in fact, this new business model would be<br />4 acceptable to those places where the shift is<br />5 assumed to go.<br />6 DR. BRECHER: I think also we have to be<br />7 clear to state that this is a non-sustainable<br />8 shift, that come January 1st, 2006, even this shift<br />9 will not support the patients.<br />10 Karen.<br />11 MS. LIPTON: That is my concern, that<br />12 looking forward we don't really know what is going<br />13 to happen, and we are assuming that the shift is<br />14 occurring, but no one really was able to answer the<br />15 question that I think Jerry posed, which is are<br />16 those supplies that we previously went to the<br />17 physicians' offices, are those indeed being<br />18 allocated now to hospitals, and are they being<br />19 allocated to hospitals where they expect those<br />20 patient populations to show up.<br />21 You just have the feeling that there might<br />22 not be an overall supply problem, but you just get<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (239 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />240<br />1 the feeling it is not showing up either where it is<br />2 supposed to, and it is causing serious problems for<br />3 those patients.<br />4 I will say it again, I said we keep taking<br />5 actions, and we don't realize what the tail is on<br />6 the end, and I almost think we are harming things<br />7 without stopping and saying, look, you have to look<br />8 ahead here, and if we don't think ASP plus 6 is<br />9 going to work in the primary care setting, why do<br />10 we think ASP plus 8 is going to even remotely work<br />11 in the hospital setting.<br />12 DR. BRECHER: Jerry.<br />13 DR. HOLMBERG: Julie, are you in the back<br />14 there? Can I ask you a question, please?<br />15 Allocations, when did they go in effect? I thought<br />16 that they were in effect way before our May<br />17 meeting.<br />18 MS. BIRKHOFER: Yes, each company has made<br />19 their individual decisions based on their business<br />20 practices to put in place allocation, which again<br />21 is based upon historical order volumes. PPTA, as<br />22 you know, maintains a data gathering program, and<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (240 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />241<br />1 for IVIG, since January, the data has been in the<br />2 yellow light, which is approximately four weeks of<br />3 inventory is available.<br />4 Comments made to the fact that the market<br />5 is dynamic and changing, and that companies have<br />6 streamlined their distribution practices is<br />7 evidence that four weeks in this market may be<br />8 sufficient.<br />9 So, from PPTA's industrywide data, there<br />10 is not a shortage, there is not a supply issue. We<br />11 are in the yellow. Yellow means four weeks. It<br />12 does not mean that there are shortages.<br />13 MS. VOGEL: Hi. Just to react to that<br />14 statement, IDF receives calls from all different<br />15 sites of care. At this point, I mean it is not a<br />16 matter of just a tightening market. I mean we<br />17 could talk about it in different terms.<br />18 The calls going, in the first place, about<br />19 shift of site of service, you are right. I mean<br />20 the allocations, I mean every product is on<br />21 allocation. When you are shifting a huge number of<br />22 patients from one site to another, the allocations<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (241 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />242<br />1 don't follow the patients. So, the hospitals are<br />2 getting increases there.<br />3 However, and this is a big however, we are<br />4 seeing a trend right now of allocations being<br />5 reported into IDF being cut by 20 percent, and that<br />6 has nothing to do with the increase in Medicare<br />7 patients. Don't know why that is happening, it<br />8 could be with Red Cross leaving, exiting the<br />9 marketplace, I am making assumptions at this point<br />10 because I am not an expert on the supply area.<br />11 I am just reporting back to you what we<br />12 are hearing, but there is many, many hospital<br />13 systems who are taking on these patients who don't<br />14 have either product because of the increases, or<br />15 are talking about allocations being cut.<br />16 So, in this scenario, the best situation<br />17 is to get patients back into the right sites of<br />18 service and to treat them. Until we do that, we<br />19 won't know the true seriousness, if we have a true<br />20 supply problem or not. We have to get them where<br />21 they need to be treated, and at that point, we will<br />22 be able to tell if there are supply issues.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (242 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />243<br />1 DR. BRECHER: Julie, did you want to say<br />2 anything? Okay.<br />3 Jay.<br />4 DR. EPSTEIN: I would like to ask Julie a<br />5 question. Can you confirm the assertion that the<br />6 distributions have been flat for the last six<br />7 months or so, because I think part of what concerns<br />8 me is that there was an historic trend of steadily<br />9 increasing utilization, and what has happened is<br />10 that in the face of that trend, there has been for<br />11 at least the last six months, flat distribution.<br />12 So, on the one hand, it may be that there<br />13 is, if you will, not a supply crisis in the sense<br />14 that there is enough supply for well-established<br />15 indications, for example, but the problem is, is it<br />16 sufficient in the face of the historically<br />17 accelerating demand, or is there a deficient supply<br />18 relative to the demand that exists, in other words,<br />19 we can't meet all prescribers' needs even though we<br />20 probably could for some subset of those<br />21 prescribers' needs.<br />22 I think that is part of it.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (243 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />244<br />1 MS. BIRKHOFER: I would completely agree<br />2 with you, Dr. Epstein. Distribution has remained,<br />3 as you say, flat, somewhat aligned over the past<br />4 six months. Demand, we know has increased 6 or 8<br />5 percent, and the companies, given the manufacturing<br />6 processes that it takes 6 to 9 months to bring<br />7 these therapies to market, the companies are all<br />8 individually looking at ways that they can<br />9 manufacture more.<br />10 But we can't make that prediction. All we<br />11 can base our comments on is what our supply data,<br />12 industrywide supply data shows, and also non-PPTA<br />13 member companies report this data, and again we are<br />14 showing inventory in the yellow consistently.<br />15 DR. EPSTEIN: If I could press the point a<br />16 little bit more, the yellow zone was defined, after<br />17 all, arbitrarily. In other words, how is the<br />18 supply stratification of red light, green light,<br />19 yellow light, designed in terms of demand? In<br />20 other words, what makes yellow yellow in comparison<br />21 to effect of demand? How do you know that what you<br />22 are calling yellow isn't really red?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (244 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />245<br />1 MS. BIRKHOFER: That is one of the things<br />2 that the PPTA North American Board of Directors is<br />3 looking at. The traffic light system and the<br />4 ratios that trigger those lights, that was put in<br />5 place about six years ago, working with member<br />6 company representatives, as well as Georgetown<br />7 Economic Services, GES.<br />8 Georgetown Economic Services are Ph.D.<br />9 economists that help look at the market, and<br />10 basically, they put ratios in place where about<br />11 0.25 equals about one week of supply, so right now,<br />12 when I say we are in the yellow, that is a ratio of<br />13 between 0.6 and 1.24. 1.25 and above is green and<br />14 0.5 and below is a red light.<br />15 Again, you know, these ratios were put in<br />16 place five, six years ago. What PPTA is looking at<br />17 now is yellow or new green based on the current<br />18 market dynamics, but that is something that we<br />19 can't change the ratios now, you know, as<br />20 arbitrarily. We need to have deliberation, we need<br />21 to work with the economists, we need to relook at<br />22 things.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (245 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />246<br />1 I mean we can't, in the midst of this<br />2 question of is there supply issue, is it<br />3 reimbursement, you know, the perfect storm, is it<br />4 demand. We need to give this time to let the<br />5 market play itself out.<br />6 DR. BRECHER: I guess what people are<br />7 concerned about, it may not be red, but maybe it's<br />8 orange.<br />9 Celso.<br />10 DR. BIANCO: Actually, for Julie, did I<br />11 understand you correctly that the ratios, they are<br />12 not adjusted for the increase in demand?<br />13 MS. BIRKHOFER: The current system in<br />14 place was put in place about 5 1/2, 6 six years<br />15 ago.<br />16 DR. BIANCO: So, you are using a week,<br />17 what was used, the IVIG that was distributed during<br />18 a week 5 or 6 years ago.<br />19 MS. BIRKHOFER: That's correct.<br />20 DR. BRECHER: Michelle.<br />21 MS. VOGEL: I would also like to make one<br />22 other comment. The other thing that is being<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (246 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />247<br />1 reported in to us, many hospital systems are<br />2 starting to put in their disease state management<br />3 programs and putting pecking orders in place based<br />4 on who should receive IVIG first because of supply<br />5 issues in those hospitals.<br />6 So, that also brings concern issues to the<br />7 forefront.<br />8 DR. BRECHER: Jerry.<br />9 DR. HOLMBERG: Just to point out on that,<br />10 that fact, in my discussions with the pharmacists<br />11 that have put in various prescription reviews, that<br />12 really the labeled uses are going first, and that<br />13 that is a high priority.<br />14 Actually, when they get a request for an<br />15 off-label use that does not match one of even the<br />16 30 that CMS has added to, that what they have done<br />17 is they then take it internally within their own<br />18 review process, but the pharmacists that I have<br />19 talked to in representing large hospital<br />20 organizations, have said that having this mechanism<br />21 in place has ensured that the people that need to<br />22 get the product get the product first.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (247 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />248<br />1 Can I add another comment? I see two<br />2 other issues here. We did hear comments--I could<br />3 guess three different issues that I would like to<br />4 talk about, and that is that, first of all, we have<br />5 heard this morning that there has been an increase<br />6 in the albumin utilization, which also drives the<br />7 economics on the manufacturer side, which may also<br />8 help correct the market.<br />9 But then also with the ITP, I saw that in<br />10 the booklet that AmerisourceBergen has given us,<br />11 that ITP accounts for 8 percent, and isn't there a<br />12 new course of therapy for the ITP that will be<br />13 moving away from the use of IVIG for ITP? So, is<br />14 there a potential gain of 8 percent?<br />15 DR. WONG: Are you talking about WinRho?<br />16 DR. HOLMBERG: Yes.<br />17 DR. WONG: There is a choice between the<br />18 two, and the side effects are different. So, some<br />19 patients may opt not to use WinRho even though, in<br />20 our hospital, it's the first line for ITP, because<br />21 of the IGIV issue.<br />22 DR. BRECHER: Of course, it only can be<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (248 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />249<br />1 used on the Rh-positive individuals.<br />2 DR. WONG: Yes, but most people are.<br />3 DR. BRACEY: The other thing is that<br />4 recently, there are some negative reports in terms<br />5 of risk associated with WinRho, that are beginning<br />6 to come out, and I would think that that is going<br />7 to impact, to only increase IVIG requests.<br />8 DR. WONG: To clarify, the negative<br />9 reports were on intravascular hemolysis, is that<br />10 what you are alluding to? Yes, that is still under<br />11 investigation right now. Most of us have not seen<br />12 that. I just came from an expert panel looking<br />13 into the side effects. So, we are still monitoring<br />14 that.<br />15 DR. BRECHER: I guess there also is<br />16 another IV preparation of anti-D that is on the<br />17 market, although I don't think it is approved for<br />18 the ITP indication as yet.<br />19 DR. HOLMBERG: There was a third point<br />20 that I wanted to make, and that is that we still go<br />21 back to what is ASP, and ASP is the average sales<br />22 price coming from the manufacturer.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (249 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />250<br />1 That is being calculated and monitored.<br />2 Now, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to be able<br />3 to figure out what is happening between the<br />4 manufacturer and the pharmacist.<br />5 Obviously, there is somebody in between,<br />6 and so how do we get a handle on the prices,<br />7 because I get reports every day that sometimes it<br />8 is up to $118 a gram, $120 a gram, and so that is<br />9 not coming from the manufacturer or else we would<br />10 see an increase in the ASP.<br />11 So, there is a problem here in the<br />12 distributor. Now, the manufacturers have two<br />13 different choices. They can go either through<br />14 their distributor or I think the AmerisourceBergen<br />15 says the unencumbered pathway, and through the<br />16 unencumbered pathway, that may be the free market<br />17 or the spot market approach.<br />18 But the bottom line is how do we get from<br />19 a system where it is being reported to CMS one<br />20 price, but then when it goes through a secondary<br />21 hand, there is an increase in price, and I think<br />22 that that is what we are all struggling with.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (250 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT</p><p>251<br />1 DR. BRECHER: Karen.<br />2 MS. LIPTON: It is interesting you raise<br />3 that, Jerry, because I was struck by that, too, as<br />4 I was leafing through, and it says unencumbered,<br />5 which are mostly the primary care physicians'<br />6 offices are the ones who do not have a contract<br />7 price, so they are really floating more and go<br />8 through the distributors.<br />9 But again I think that that situation<br />10 still comes back to, that means that ASP probably<br />11 doesn't even work in a setting when you are dealing<br />12 with a primary care physician, because maybe their<br />13 prices are so volatile.<br />14 No matter what, it still affects where the<br />15 patients can get care, and I think that is what our<br />16 concern is.<br />17 DR. HOLMBERG: I think of one of the<br />18 things that I have heard from the grass-roots<br />19 people have been, especially clinicians treating,<br />20 is that shifting the patient from one location to<br />21 another, the iatrogenic problems, the infections,<br />22 and one physician that I talked to said yeah, you<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (251 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />252<br />1 know, I did get treatment for this patient, but he<br />2 wound up one month on IV antibiotics. That is<br />3 another side effect.<br />4 So, you know, what are we doing here, and<br />5 also I think that Marsha Boyle, I think that you<br />6 did mention in one of your notes there about the<br />7 cost, that somebody had made a comment that it was<br />8 like 600-some plus dollars. I am sorry?<br />9 MS. BOYLE: It is much more expensive in<br />10 the hospital from what we are hearing.<br />11 DR. HOLMBERG: And that is because it is<br />12 under the AWP at 83 percent.<br />13 DR. WONG: Do we have any idea how much it<br />14 cost ASP Plus 10 percent, plus 15 percent for the<br />15 physicians to be able to administer it?<br />16 DR. BRECHER: That's a good question,<br />17 where would it break even?<br />18 Jerry.<br />19 DR. SANDLER: I would like to make three<br />20 comments. The first one relates to the letter that<br />21 we got back dated August 8th, addressed to you, Mr.<br />22 Chairman, and signed by the Acting Assistant<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (252 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />253<br />1 Secretary of Health.<br />2 The third paragraphs says, "that after<br />3 discussions, we concluded that there are sufficient<br />4 supplies available." But when you get to the<br />5 fourth paragraph, the Assistant Secretary says, "We<br />6 believe that physicians should ensure that priority<br />7 be given to FDA-labeled uses and those diseases and<br />8 conditions that have been shown to benefit based on<br />9 safety and efficacy."<br />10 I find a little disconnect here, because<br />11 that last statement is, in effect, saying that the<br />12 current conditions require that we tell doctors not<br />13 to treat patients the way they best attempt to do<br />14 so. I mean a physician orders IVIG off label is<br />15 not doing something bad.<br />16 The FDA-approved indications evolve from<br />17 the experience that has been derived by treating<br />18 people in this way, and there are many people being<br />19 treated in my hospital with IVIG off label, who are<br />20 absolutely getting benefit.<br />21 So, going off label isn't a bad thing.<br />22 The second point I would like to make, I<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (253 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />254<br />1 work in a hospital. I have been working in<br />2 hospitals most of my career. It is absolutely not<br />3 the optimal place for a doctor who is following a<br />4 patient with a primary immune deficiency disease to<br />5 be sending his patient.<br />6 Most patients wait for their appointment<br />7 to talk to their doctor or to talk to the case<br />8 manager or to the nurse practitioner, and at that<br />9 point say, by the way, you know, I have been having<br />10 this or that happening, and I was kind of waiting<br />11 until I come in.<br />12 The transfer of these patients is putting<br />13 them in a situation where they are going to be<br />14 losing contact on a regular basis with their<br />15 primary caregiver, and this is not a shift that<br />16 should be driven by economics. It is not going in<br />17 the right direction.<br />18 The third point I would like to make is<br />19 this whole issue I think underlines what Mr. Dubin<br />20 was pointing out in his very first opening<br />21 statement, which is, isn't there some loss of<br />22 connection between this committee and the people<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (254 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />255<br />1 and the higher ups who make decisions.<br />2 This is something we communicated was<br />3 really urgent. We said this is really urgent, and<br />4 the people who are making the decisions are<br />5 handling this with a 5-page paragraph letter<br />6 saying, well, we heard what you say, but we have<br />7 done some other stuff, and our advice from what we<br />8 have done overrides the advice you are giving us,<br />9 which is exactly what Mr. Dubin was trying to say<br />10 about the discounting of the importance of this<br />11 committee at a high level, and this is a very good<br />12 example of how that discounting is taking place.<br />13 DR. BRECHER: Jerry.<br />14 DR. HOLMBERG: Dr. Sandler, I sort or take<br />15 a different view on some of your comments that you<br />16 have made there, and that is that in taking the<br />17 recommendation, there was a lot of investigation<br />18 done on the whole supply and demand and<br />19 reimbursement issue.<br />20 I can say that this is one reason why I<br />21 follow up on every call that I get on a complaint<br />22 that supply is not available, because when I do<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (255 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />256<br />1 follow up on it, the supply becomes available.<br />2 So, you know, I don't understand why a<br />3 phone call has to be made to shake something loose,<br />4 what other dynamics are going on here, and so<br />5 really based on the evidence that has been<br />6 presented to the Department, yes, we have a<br />7 tightening of the market, but I don't think we have<br />8 a supply issue.<br />9 DR. SANDLER: Well, I want to go back to<br />10 that statement that says physicians should ensure<br />11 that priority be given to IVIG treatment for<br />12 FDA-labeled uses and conditions.<br />13 Inherent in that statement is it looks<br />14 like we are in a situation where doctors shouldn't<br />15 prescribe this medication the way they think they<br />16 should for all of their patients. That is what<br />17 that is saying, and it seems to me that it would be<br />18 really great if it said the United States of<br />19 America, with all of its resources, has enough IVIG<br />20 to provide for all of the patients including those<br />21 that doctors feel deserve it.<br />22 DR. BRECHER: All right, Committee, what<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (256 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />257<br />1 are we going to do?<br />2 Karen.<br />3 MS. LIPTON: I guess one of the things<br />4 again what we heard today is really this issue of<br />5 patients moving, so if we said something else, it<br />6 really is that patients can't receive the care that<br />7 they need to get in the primary physician's office,<br />8 and we don't know why, but that trend has not<br />9 stopped, and there still seems to be an erosion in<br />10 care.<br />11 Now, maybe we can't really weigh in on<br />12 what we think it's the reimbursement or we think<br />13 it's the supply problem, because I am beginning to<br />14 think we don't really know if it's a supply<br />15 problem.<br />16 It certainly seems to be, if it's not<br />17 supply, an allocation. What we don't really<br />18 understand is reimbursement driving that issue or<br />19 is there something else at work. But at a minimum,<br />20 it seems to me we could still send an urgent<br />21 message that we have seen no positive change in the<br />22 very disturbing trend of patients being removed<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (257 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />258<br />1 from their normal primary caregiving setting, which<br />2 we believe is beneficial to the patient, and it is<br />3 being transferred over to that hospital setting,<br />4 and we don't think that is in the best interests of<br />5 these patients.<br />6 DR. BRECHER: We also can reiterate that<br />7 the impending change in reimbursement in the<br />8 hospital setting will make this shift to the<br />9 hospitals non-sustainable, or we anticipate that it<br />10 is not sustainable.<br />11 Michelle.<br />12 MS. VOGEL: DR. Holmberg, you have done a<br />13 great job in following up on all these cases, and I<br />14 thank you so much. Just looking forward, I mean<br />15 January 1st, when the prices go down, no matter<br />16 what the supply issue is, you can make all the<br />17 calls you want, it is not going to open up the<br />18 doors to these patients.<br />19 So, I agree with what your statement is,<br />20 going forward with that. The other thing is what<br />21 we can say we do know is that since this past<br />22 January 1st was when we started seeing the shift in<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (258 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />259<br />1 patients. When CMS increased their rates a little<br />2 bit January 14th, we saw a little bit of a<br />3 hesitation and patients were okay.<br />4 Once April hit and the products were<br />5 separated, and the prices crashed, all of a sudden<br />6 the shift happened dramatically overnight and<br />7 continued to spiral downward. So, no matter what<br />8 is going on with supply, we can definitely say that<br />9 reimbursement has affected the transitioning of<br />10 patients, and we know that this transition has<br />11 happened in Medicare patients, and is not happening<br />12 in the private insurance market.<br />13 So, in that, we can say that ASP plus 6<br />14 percent has caused this.<br />15 DR. BRECHER: Mark.<br />16 MR. SKINNER: Can I ask one more question?<br />17 I am going to try to ask, and maybe it's what Dr.<br />18 Sandler was getting to, and maybe this is a<br />19 question for Julie.<br />20 If the companies were not on allocation,<br />21 would there still be a 4-week supply, would they<br />22 still be in yellow, or is it the allocation process<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (259 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />260<br />1 that is actually creating the artificial yellow<br />2 light--I should say is creating the yellow light<br />3 that is artificial?<br />4 MS. BIRKHOFER: That is a very difficult<br />5 question, and I really don't have a crystal ball, I<br />6 can't answer it. I can only tell you what I know<br />7 today, and based on our data today, there is<br />8 sufficient inventory that translate to 4 weeks, and<br />9 just to clarify Dr. Bianco's question, although<br />10 these ratios were put in place 5, 6 years ago, they<br />11 are obviously updated monthly. The ratio<br />12 represents distribution divided by the annual 12<br />13 month of inventory.<br />14 So, they are updated, they are rolling, if<br />15 you will, but I can't speculate, I just can't.<br />16 DR. HOLMBERG: Just to follow up on what<br />17 Michelle Vogel commented about, and again on what<br />18 Dr. Brecher has already suggested as far as<br />19 wording, any of my comments I really, you know, I<br />20 am trying to address the immediate need, and yet<br />21 what is in the back of my mind, and what we have to<br />22 keep thinking about, is what is going to happen<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (260 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />261<br />1 January 1st, and I fully agree with that, is that<br />2 costwise, what is it going to cost the U.S.<br />3 Government for Medicare patients when they get<br />4 shifted over to greater than 24-hour care under a<br />5 DRG.<br />6 I have not been able to get the answers<br />7 for that, but see, that's the next shift that you<br />8 are going to see, I mean as far as my opinion, in<br />9 predicting what is going to happen, is that you are<br />10 going to see--you have now seen it go from the<br />11 infusion centers, home care, physicians' office, to<br />12 the hospital outpatient. Then, it's going to shift<br />13 to the inpatient under a DRG.<br />14 That is a concern, and I don't mean to<br />15 discount, with some of my comments, the fact that<br />16 we need to be looking forward to what will happen<br />17 January 1st.<br />18 MS. VOGEL: And I agree with you, Dr.<br />19 Holmberg, and what is really scary with that is,<br />20 you know, medical necessity, do you have to be<br />21 admitted as an inpatient to receive IVIG, and the<br />22 answer is no, but what will it take before you can<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (261 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />262<br />1 be, and how sick do you have to get before Medicare<br />2 will cover you as an inpatient to get your<br />3 infusion.<br />4 At that point, it will be too late, so it<br />5 really gets to the point of how many patients are<br />6 we going to allow die before something can change.<br />7 I mean there are certain things that we can try to<br />8 prevent for the hospital reimbursement, what has<br />9 happened in the physicians' offices have occurred.<br />10 The only thing that can change that<br />11 immediately is the Secretary either declaring a<br />12 public health emergency or Congress making a<br />13 statutory change. I mean those are two options<br />14 right now for physicians' offices.<br />15 The other option for hospital outpatient<br />16 right now to prevent the hospitals from crashing is<br />17 for CMS to look during the proposed rulemaking and<br />18 to state either one of the options that we have<br />19 talked about, an add-on payment or dampening<br />20 provision or separating out these HCFA codes if<br />21 they are willing to do any of that.<br />22 If not, they go with ASP plus 8 percent,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (262 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />263<br />1 we have a disaster on our hands, and then what<br />2 happens in going to inpatient and when will the<br />3 hospitals be willing to allow the patients to be<br />4 admitted. So, we have a serious spiraling effect.<br />5 We know that there are many private<br />6 insurance companies have dropped their rates,<br />7 Medicaid has dropped their rates, the Federal<br />8 Employees Health Benefit Program has dropped their<br />9 rates, and we know Medicaid reform is about to<br />10 occur, that is going to mirror what Medicare has<br />11 happened.<br />12 So, for a population that is so fragile,<br />13 that needs this one therapy and can't get it, it is<br />14 devastating, and I don't understand what we need to<br />15 do to get this to change, but I am just hoping that<br />16 this committee will stand strong and stand behind<br />17 your recommendations that you made in May, and<br />18 continue to help push this.<br />19 We will continue to work with Congress to<br />20 push their support for whatever needs to go forward<br />21 and to get legislative change, but it is helpful<br />22 with your recommendations.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (263 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />264<br />1 DR. BRECHER: I think it is time to write<br />2 something, burn up a few pixels. We can either<br />3 just start by asking for suggestions, that we take<br />4 a five-minute break pull the subcommittee together,<br />5 throw a few words together to begin with, and then<br />6 we can play with that.<br />7 I would suggest that we get a core group<br />8 of maybe five people, maybe Paul, Karen, anyone<br />9 else, Jay. Jay is writing, even better, let's give<br />10 Jay five minutes and we will come back.<br />11 [Recess.]<br />12 DR. BRECHER: The suggested initial<br />13 wording for this resolution, principally authored<br />14 by Jay, reads as follows:<br />15 The committee remains highly concerned<br />16 that disruptions to access for IGIV, including a<br />17 shift to hospital-based therapy, continue to<br />18 compromise quality of care for many patients. We<br />19 further are concerned that a change to hospital<br />20 outpatient reimbursement, to ASP plus 8 percent,<br />21 effective January 2006, will further aggravate an<br />22 already difficult situation and that this shift<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (264 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />265<br />1 will not be sustainable.<br />2 We therefore recommend that the Secretary<br />3 take immediate steps to:<br />4 1. Increase reimbursement for<br />5 non-hospital IGIV therapy to a level consistent<br />6 with current market pricing.<br />7 2. Reconsider the current program to<br />8 hospital outpatient reimbursement to ASP plus 8<br />9 percent in January 2006.<br />10 3. Re-examine the extent to which current<br />11 IGIV supplies are or are not meeting demand.<br />12 So, we are open to suggestions.<br />13 Jerry.<br />14 DR. SANDLER: In our letter, we urged the<br />15 Secretary to declare a public health emergency, so<br />16 as to enable CMS to apply alternative mechanisms<br />17 for determining reimbursement schedule, et cetera.<br />18 Wouldn't that be a necessary component if<br />19 we wanted some action, in other words, shouldn't<br />20 this immediate request get back to that we are<br />21 requesting a public health emergency, so as to get<br />22 this stuff done?<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (265 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />266<br />1 DR. BRECHER: I don't know. Jerry, does<br />2 it require an emergency, a crisis?<br />3 DR. HOLMBERG: Well, I think that the<br />4 letters that you have already seen from Congress,<br />5 that was provided by the IDF, and then also the<br />6 letter from the two congressmen, that I provided<br />7 you, it does show that Congress is very concerned<br />8 about this.<br />9 The thing is, though, that will a public<br />10 health emergency correct the problem, or will a<br />11 congressional change correct the problem, and you<br />12 have to understand that CMS's hands are tied.<br />13 Now, the public health emergency can<br />14 change some things, but it will not be a long-term<br />15 fix, and the thing is that I am concerned about is<br />16 that the direction here of calling a public health<br />17 emergency when we--well, first of all, when<br />18 Congress needs to look at the issue, and secondly,<br />19 I think that the letters that have been received<br />20 from Congress has caused CMS to very carefully<br />21 consider some of the changes.<br />22 Now, saying all that, I would stay away<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (266 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />267<br />1 from a public health emergency, but I think that it<br />2 needs to be strong enough to be able to get the<br />3 message across that CMS needs to work through their<br />4 legislative avenues.<br />5 DR. BRECHER: Mark.<br />6 MR. SKINNER: I tend to think that the<br />7 concept of declaring a public health emergency<br />8 needs to stay on the table at this point. Between<br />9 now and January, there is not much time, and the<br />10 problem is only to get worse, and to expect<br />11 Congress to enact new authorization, or to take<br />12 action for CMS to change something in three months,<br />13 and to have it in place, to me, seems a little bit<br />14 unrealistic.<br />15 I do recognize that the public health<br />16 emergency is a short-term solution or bandaid<br />17 solution until the real thing can occur, but I am<br />18 not sure that we shouldn't continue to argue that<br />19 all of the powers be used, because the situation is<br />20 escalating.<br />21 DR. BRECHER: Jay.<br />22 DR. EPSTEIN: Perhaps we need to say<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (267 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />268<br />1 something explicit about short-term measures. I<br />2 think part of the problem here is that there is, if<br />3 you will, a reasonable reluctance not to make the<br />4 system worse in the long haul by doing something in<br />5 the short haul.<br />6 But I think that part of the issue of<br />7 urgency is that one must do something in the short<br />8 run, and I think that that is perhaps yet another<br />9 message that needs to get communicated. We were<br />10 saying that, in essence, by calling for a<br />11 declaration of emergency, but we were doing it<br />12 because we thought that the legal framework didn't<br />13 allow for another remedy.<br />14 I think what the pushback is, which we<br />15 have heard from Jerry, is that there is a<br />16 reluctance for the Department to do that, because<br />17 it might tamper with the system in a way that is<br />18 adverse for the future.<br />19 But I think that the way around that is to<br />20 call attention to the need for short-term actions<br />21 independent of long-term solutions. I am just<br />22 concerned that if we call again for, you know, a<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (268 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />269<br />1 declaration of emergency, it already fell on deaf<br />2 ears once, what exactly are we going to accomplish.<br />3 DR. BRECHER: Julie.<br />4 MS. BIRKHOFER: Thank you, Dr. Brecher, if<br />5 I could just comment. The public health emergency<br />6 that is language in the MMA, that could be used to<br />7 address the payment for the drug, and I certainly<br />8 am not disputing that at all, but another mechanism<br />9 that is available to CMS in the short term, as<br />10 well, would be the classification of biologic<br />11 response modifier, and that is a payment on the<br />12 physician administration side.<br />13 So, you have the payment for the drug,<br />14 which is the ASP, and then you have the cost of<br />15 services to physicians, so just respectfully, we<br />16 would also ask CMS--and I know they have had<br />17 meetings with IDF and Quad AI, and I believe the<br />18 AMA, or Quad AI and IDF--went in with a lot of<br />19 scientific and clinical information of why IVIG is<br />20 a biologic response modifier, and those of you<br />21 around the table that are physicians probably know<br />22 why it is, but that would be short term, as well.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (269 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />270<br />1 MS. VOGEL: I could further explain that<br />2 since I was in the meeting with CMS. Basically,<br />3 you have two different mechanisms. You have got to<br />4 increase the reimbursement for the drug, and I<br />5 think you can pretty much say that most providers,<br />6 physicians, or whoever it is, they are not going to<br />7 be buying product at a loss especially at the<br />8 number of grams you are talking about, so you have<br />9 got to get the reimbursement up to at least the<br />10 cost. I mean and that is where you are at.<br />11 Doctors are like if I could at least break<br />12 even, I would be taking these patients. Now, on<br />13 the administration side, they got hit both ways.<br />14 They have got hit on the drug side, they got hit on<br />15 the administration side.<br />16 The administration side applies to both<br />17 the physician's office, and is going to apply to<br />18 the hospitals, and so the highest classification<br />19 for IVIG is a biologic response modifier. It meets<br />20 the definition. It's a high complexity<br />21 administration product. CMS just needs to<br />22 recognize it as such.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (270 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />271<br />1 The meeting went well, and I think they<br />2 are open to it. They can accept it immediately.<br />3 They could put a transmittal out, and then we could<br />4 be reimbursed at a higher percentage, but I have to<br />5 still say with that, if you don't get the drug<br />6 price up, you are not going to succeed, and with<br />7 your language on increasing reimbursement in the<br />8 non-hospital setting, I think it is very important<br />9 to say that, but the only mechanism that CMS does<br />10 have currently, on a short-term basis, is through,<br />11 unfortunately, the language of a public health<br />12 emergency.<br />13 Other than that, it is going to take an<br />14 act of Congress to change this.<br />15 MS. BOYLE: I would just like to reiterate<br />16 what Michelle has said, but as far as the public<br />17 health emergency, whether it is actually declared<br />18 or not, that has really raised awareness. You<br />19 know, members of Congress are signing on. If you<br />20 continue with that recommendation, it's putting the<br />21 emphasis on how important this is.<br />22 The biological response modifier, I think<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (271 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />272<br />1 is something you could do right now. I think it<br />2 makes a lot of sense to put your wording in there,<br />3 but I still question why not recommending the<br />4 public health emergency.<br />5 DR. BRECHER: Jay.<br />6 DR. EPSTEIN: Mark, I would suggest that<br />7 you make the two points of reclassifying IGIV as a<br />8 biological response modifier, and exercising the<br />9 authority to declare a public health emergency to<br />10 provide CMS with alternative reimbursement<br />11 scheduling, as subpoints under No. 1, because they<br />12 are simply specific suggestions under No. 1.<br />13 Again, I am not close enough to the<br />14 subject to know whether those are the only<br />15 available tools, but there is no reason that those<br />16 can't be mentioned.<br />17 DR. HOLMBERG: I would like to ask a<br />18 question of our economist here. The way No. 1 is<br />19 worded, to a level consistent with the local market<br />20 or current market pricing, when you have a<br />21 distributor in the place there, in the middle, and<br />22 you have the pricing being determined by the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (272 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />273<br />1 manufacturer, how do you guarantee that?<br />2 I mean the formulas that are available do<br />3 not reflect the distributor.<br />4 DR. HAAS: Well, the guarantee is an<br />5 interesting word. As soon as you put it out in the<br />6 marketplace, the concept of guarantee disappears.<br />7 You have guarantee only if they are fixed prices,<br />8 and that, I don't think any of us would want to<br />9 look very seriously at unless it were--well, I will<br />10 just stop there. I don't think we want to look<br />11 very seriously in trying to fix prices.<br />12 You know, this is unresolvable problem in<br />13 the sense that we don't have a situation where the<br />14 seller and the end user are directly connected to<br />15 one another.<br />16 There are these intervening markets which<br />17 are not under any type of control, so I think we<br />18 have got to make the statement in such a way that<br />19 the doctor that prescribes the IVIG is paid enough<br />20 to cover the cost of his or her services, and I<br />21 don't know the right wording there. I am not close<br />22 enough either to give an answer to that.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (273 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />274<br />1 Jerry, it's the other thing. I want to<br />2 continue to reemphasize something Jay said earlier.<br />3 When we get through with this, I think it ought to<br />4 be set up in such a way there are short-term points<br />5 and some long-term points. I think they need to be<br />6 separated and clear.<br />7 DR. BRECHER: Art.<br />8 DR. BRACEY: One of the things I guess<br />9 that I am concerned about is that I would think<br />10 that on the other side, the decisionmakers perhaps<br />11 are not as sensitive to the quality issues<br />12 associated with the shift.<br />13 I mean they see it as a neutral. It would<br />14 be too detailed to go through the entirety of it in<br />15 this document, but I would wonder, is there a<br />16 chance for an interface to explain, you know, what<br />17 the quality issues related to the shift would be.<br />18 I mean is that something that can be done?<br />19 DR. BRECHER: We have done that before<br />20 where resolutions have gone forward to the<br />21 Assistant Secretary and felt that additional<br />22 explanation was needed, and we have had am a<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (274 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />275<br />1 meeting with the Assistant Secretary with a<br />2 subgroup of the committee and other interested<br />3 parties. So, that is a possibility.<br />4 Jeanne.<br />5 DR. LINDEN: This isn't really directly<br />6 related to that, but it is sort of related to who<br />7 understands what in terms of our position, but I<br />8 was looking at this web site printout that says the<br />9 Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and<br />10 Availability, but the text has a lot of things that<br />11 were in Dr. Beato's letter that I don't think we<br />12 really decided or necessarily agree with.<br />13 So, I am wondering if that's misleading to<br />14 people in how we make our thoughts known, if that's<br />15 not what is in the record on the web site.<br />16 DR. BRECHER: Specifically, are you<br />17 referring to the recommendation about off-label<br />18 use?<br />19 DR. LINDEN: Yes, in terms of the supply<br />20 being sufficient, not having concerns in that<br />21 regard, and recommending that physicians would<br />22 better serve their patients by communicating their<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (275 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:01 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />276<br />1 needs directly and focusing on approved label use,<br />2 not off-label uses.<br />3 DR. BRECHER: I think we have had concerns<br />4 about that, but I think there are bigger fish to<br />5 fry right now, which is the reimbursement. If we<br />6 could fix the reimbursement, I think that it would<br />7 all fall into place.<br />8 Jerry.<br />9 DR. SANDLER: I apologize I wasn't here<br />10 this morning, I wasn't able to be for the<br />11 presentation. Am I correct that the<br />12 representatives of the patients have not had a<br />13 direct audience with the Assistant Secretary of<br />14 Health?<br />15 The purpose of my asking that question is<br />16 that my advocacy for these patients is driven a lot<br />17 by the testimony as it is given very effectively by<br />18 the representatives, and I am hoping that this<br />19 committee isn't serving as a filter, preventing the<br />20 Assistant Secretary from hearing the heart-moving<br />21 stories of these people.<br />22 MS. VOGEL: We have not met with the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (276 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />277<br />1 Assistant Secretary. We have requested a meeting<br />2 with Secretary Leavitt, and we are supposed to be<br />3 part of a meeting with him or his chief of staff on<br />4 Friday.<br />5 We have met with Herb Kuhn on many<br />6 occasions, and we have also put in a request to<br />7 meet with Administrator McClellan, but, no, we have<br />8 not met with the Assistant Secretary.<br />9 DR. BRECHER: But you do have a meeting on<br />10 Friday with a high-level official?<br />11 MS. VOGEL: Yes, we are part of a group<br />12 meeting with Secretary Leavitt or his chief of<br />13 staff.<br />14 DR. BRECHER: That should help drive home<br />15 the message.<br />16 Jay.<br />17 DR. EPSTEIN: I think we should come back<br />18 to Art's point about the added negative effects of<br />19 in-hospital therapy, and at least flag the issue in<br />20 the first paragraph.<br />21 I am not exactly sure what specifically we<br />22 want to say, but let's see. Perhaps instead of<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (277 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />278<br />1 saying "including a shift to hospital-based<br />2 therapy," we could say, "which are aggravated by<br />3 the shift."<br />4 DR. BRECHER: Is it that the disruptions<br />5 are aggravated, or is it that the risk to the<br />6 patient is increased by putting them in a hospital<br />7 setting as opposed to a doctor's office?<br />8 DR. EPSTEIN: We could add a second<br />9 sentence saying something along the lines that in<br />10 particular, we believe that hospital-based therapy<br />11 adds increased risks and costs to patient care,<br />12 something along those lines.<br />13 DR. BRECHER: Jerry.<br />14 DR. SANDLER: I think the words<br />15 "hospital-based therapy" may cloud a little bit of<br />16 the issue. Speaking as someone who covers one of<br />17 the infusion services here in town, I, of course,<br />18 wouldn't act as the technologist for the patient's<br />19 doctor and just give the infusions for a person who<br />20 is so precarious. We would require that such a<br />21 person transfer care to be using the infusion<br />22 services of the hospital.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (278 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />279<br />1 So, it is not just someone out there who<br />2 has taken care of a patient for the last 15 years<br />3 will write a prescription and have the person come<br />4 to the hospital and pay a little bit more and be<br />5 inconvenienced.<br />6 We wouldn't simply infuse. We would<br />7 expect the person who is being treated is our<br />8 patient, so it is really going to be the scenario<br />9 is that people will have to be transferred to<br />10 persons who will be on site to care for such<br />11 patients as they have been on site in the doctor's<br />12 office.<br />13 I think we want to make it clear.<br />14 DR. BRECHER: Well, which may not be in<br />15 the best interests of the patient if they have to<br />16 travel a great distance to get to the hospital.<br />17 DR. SANDLER: Of course. I mean, of<br />18 course, it is not in the best interests of the<br />19 patient. These people have been cared for, they<br />20 have been cared for well.

BRACEY: One of the things that I<br />18 thought that perhaps we could say is that it<br />19 disrupts the continuity of care, I think people buy<br />20 into the continuity of care, and exposes the<br />21 patients to new risks, you know, the hazards of the<br />22 hospital environment.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (281 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />282<br />1 DR.

SKINNER: I was going to make a<br />8 comment there. Instead of saying, after the first<br />9 hospital, insert the word "physician." To say to a<br />10 hospital physician or hospital setting, that way it<br />11 picks up Dr. Sandler's comment.<br />12 DR. BRECHER: Okay. Now, we have to get<br />13 rid of some of these "cares," because we care too<br />14 much. Oh, we transfer to a hospital, that gets rid<br />15 of one. Thank you.

SAYERS: I would go for persisting.<br />10 MR.

The current rate now<br />7 couldn't be reduced by more than 15 percent for<br />8 '06, and that would hopefully mitigate some of the<br />9 turmoil there would be, you know, if you reduce a<br />10 rate by more than that, that might create.<br />11 MS.

They chose not to use it,<br />20 which was a very good thing for access, because the<br />21 rates were abysmal, because of the trouble that the<br />22 GAO had was survey data.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (300 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />301<br />1 So, then, CMS put in ASP plus 6 percent<br />2 plus 2 percent, which comes to a total of ASP plus<br />3 8, so what Anna Weinstein, my colleague, just<br />4 explained, is that PPTA and this group of IVIG<br />5 community came up with these alternatives because<br />6 the framework of ASP is here to stay, and it's<br />7 accepted, and it's a shift away from AWP.<br />8 So, this group, along with PPTA, that's<br />9 where we put forward the concept of a dampening<br />10 provision, which Anna just explained. You could<br />11 freeze current rates until further knowledge was<br />12 gathered, data.<br />13 PPTA is working to collect data. The<br />14 biological response modifier, separating the J<br />15 codes, those are the types of things we discussed.<br />16 So, I just wanted to offer that.<br />17 DR. HOLMBERG: Mark, can I ask a question,<br />18 please?<br />19 DR. BRECHER: Sure.<br />20 DR. HOLMBERG: Again, a question for our<br />21 economist. If you have one setting being given<br />22 this price, doesn't it have to be consistent in all<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (301 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />302<br />1 of the settings, or else you are going to continue<br />2 to have the problem?<br />3 DR. HAAS: I would tend to think so, yes.<br />4 DR. HOLMBERG: I mean this is where we<br />5 have gotten the problem or CMS has gotten<br />6 themselves into a problem, is that it has shifted<br />7 and instead of the MMA making all the changes at<br />8 once, there has been a gradual shift, and so<br />9 therefore, the market is not going to--if I would<br />10 understand the economics correctly--the market is<br />11 not going to stabilize until all of the places that<br />12 it is being used is stabilized, are stabilized.<br />13 DR. BRECHER: Well, it is going to<br />14 stabilize to the point of least resistance to those<br />15 people who are willing to pick up the loss at the<br />16 current rate.<br />17 DR. HOLMBERG: The thing is that with what<br />18 is being recommended on the dampening, it is still<br />19 not going to correct the inpatient or the office<br />20 infusion sites.<br />21 DR. EPSTEIN: I agree with what you said,<br />22 Jerry, but I think again it's a short-term problem<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (302 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />303<br />1 we are trying to, in this case, prevent, which is<br />2 that a sudden and precipitous drop in reimbursement<br />3 in the hospital outpatient setting can only make<br />4 the current situation worse.<br />5 Now, that in itself is not going to create<br />6 parity for the non-hospital setting, let alone how<br />7 it might reconcile the inpatient care, but the<br />8 short-term issue is not to have the precipitous<br />9 drop.<br />10 MS. LIPTON: And then we have to address<br />11 the long-term issue, which probably encompasses<br />12 what Jerry, that you said is it needs to be<br />13 stabilized at a reasonable reimbursement in all<br />14 settings.<br />15 DR. EPSTEIN: Right. That may be yet<br />16 another point, but I think we ought to modify<br />17 Recommendation 2 to say, "Modify the current plan."<br />18 DR. BRECHER: Consider modifying the<br />19 current plan?<br />20 DR. EPSTEIN: Yes, or consider modifying<br />21 or modify. Consider modifying the current plan,<br />22 and I would for the moment remove the<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (303 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT</p><p>304<br />1 parenthetical, and then to change, singular, to<br />2 change hospital outpatient--take out the word<br />3 "to"--to change hospital outpatient reimbursements<br />4 to ASP plus 8 percent in January in such a way as<br />5 to prevent any sudden and large decrease in<br />6 reimbursement.<br />7 DR. BRECHER: Jerry.<br />8 DR. SANDLER: Mr. Chairman, about three<br />9 occasions now, people have suggested that you take<br />10 the word "consider" out. On three occasion, you<br />11 very politely have kept it in.<br />12 DR. BRECHER: Not intentionally.<br />13 DR. SANDLER: I am here representing the<br />14 American Hospital Association, and I can tell you<br />15 that their response to this is hell, no, and if<br />16 they were here, administrators in hospitals would<br />17 tell you, you don't want to be polite about this.<br />18 DR. BRECHER: Modify it.<br />19 DR. SANDLER: Yeah.<br />20 DR. EPSTEIN: You want to go back up and<br />21 do the same?<br />22 DR. BRECHER: Just because we are such<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (304 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />305<br />1 caring people, we like to be polite.<br />2 MS. LIPTON: I thought this was different<br />3 because we weren't sure of what the right thing to<br />4 do, there are a number of options.<br />5 DR. BRECHER: That's right, we are not<br />6 sure.<br />7 MS. LIPTON: I think that No. 1 itself may<br />8 be--I will have to read it--well, we did say it, we<br />9 said flat out, increase reimbursement. I think<br />10 that's what we want to say.<br />11 DR. BRECHER: I think No. 1 can stay as<br />12 consider, but No. 2 is stronger as modified. We<br />13 are just giving them some options.<br />14 Okay. No. 3. Do we have a No. 4?<br />15 DR. SAYERS: This is about No. 3. Can we<br />16 just way "whether" instead of "the extent to<br />17 which"?<br />18 DR. BRECHER: I am sorry, modify it?<br />19 DR. SAYERS: I was going to say,<br />20 "re-examine whether" instead of "the extent to<br />21 which."<br />22 DR. BRECHER: Oh, I see. Okay.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (305 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />306<br />1 DR. LINDEN: Is this something we want to<br />2 do just once, or do we want to say continue to<br />3 examine like on an ongoing basis versus a one-time<br />4 thing?<br />5 DR. BRECHER: Do we have to say are or are<br />6 not, or just say "are meeting demand"?<br />7 DR. LINDEN: You don't need are not.<br />8 DR. HAAS: Mark, I think there is further<br />9 questions as to what we mean by demand. There is<br />10 the demand for the label use, and the demand for<br />11 the off-label use, and since that came up in the<br />12 Secretary's letter, it would seem to me we should<br />13 be a little more clear.<br />14 DR. SAYERS: And say what?<br />15 DR. HAAS: Don't ask me.<br />16 DR. HOLMBERG: Mr. Chair, may I?<br />17 DR. BRECHER: Yes.<br />18 DR. HOLMBERG: The concern here, label and<br />19 off-label use, is the off-label use, are there<br />20 studies, clinical studies, to support the use of<br />21 this?<br />22 DR. BRECHER: Some, some better than<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (306 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />307<br />1 others.<br />2 DR. HOLMBERG: Exactly, and the concern<br />3 here is where is the evidence-based medicine to<br />4 support the use of the off-label?<br />5 DR. BRECHER: What I hear you saying,<br />6 Jerry, is don't open this can or worms to say use,<br />7 demand, to meet demand?<br />8 DR. HOLMBERG: I would say demand, just<br />9 leave it as demand.<br />10 MR. SKINNER: I have two comments about<br />11 this. I am wondering if, instead of saying<br />12 "demand," the polite way to say it would be to say<br />13 talk about meeting prescribed treatment. That way,<br />14 you are saying the physicians should be in control<br />15 of the medicine perhaps.<br />16 The other thing that bothers me about this<br />17 is because the Secretary has already said we will<br />18 continue to monitor the situation, so basically,<br />19 what we are saying is do what you said you were<br />20 going to do.<br />21 So, I thought what we were doing here is<br />22 saying we are skeptical that there isn't a supply<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (307 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />308<br />1 problem and that we think that there might be an<br />2 underlying supply problem that you haven't<br />3 detected, so go back and look again, not just to<br />4 continue to monitor it until you find one shows up.<br />5 So, I am not sure this says anything<br />6 different than what the Secretary responded in the<br />7 letter that they were already going to do.<br />8 MS. LIPTON: But, Mark, I think if you<br />9 look at the beginning where we said there is new<br />10 information, and then that, in combination with the<br />11 word "re-examine," it isn't just continue to<br />12 monitor, it's re-examine, and I think that that's--<br />13 MR. SKINNER: Okay.<br />14 DR. BRECHER: That is what I like to hear,<br />15 one lawyer talking to another lawyer.<br />16 Paul.<br />17 DR. HAAS: The way we started to write<br />18 label and off-label, I was uncomfortable with that,<br />19 too, but I guess I am still a little concerned that<br />20 the Secretary's letter and what we heard from PPTA<br />21 is if there is a four-week supply, that that seems<br />22 to suggest that this statement doesn't say a whole<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (308 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />309<br />1 lot.<br />2 DR. BRECHER: But it's a four-week supply<br />3 based on use five or six years ago.<br />4 DR. HAAS: I guess my thought would be<br />5 that they are looking for us to give directions, we<br />6 maybe want to be a little more specific in our<br />7 statement, because leaving it alone, then, I would<br />8 come back to you and say, well, what I am getting<br />9 from the manufacturer is that there is plenty of<br />10 supply out there.<br />11 DR. BRECHER: Why don't we move the word<br />12 "current," whether IGIV supplies are meeting<br />13 current demand," not demand five or six years ago<br />14 would be the implication.<br />15 MS. WEINSTEIN: Sorry, could I add one<br />16 point of clarification? The whole issue of the<br />17 yellow, red, and green light, it was decided five<br />18 or six years ago what each of those means, the<br />19 amount of supply available at each of those<br />20 different lights, but we are not talking about the<br />21 same amount, overall amount of supply that there<br />22 was back then.<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (309 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />310<br />1 DR. BRECHER: The ratio?<br />2 MS. WEINSTEIN: Yes, it's a ratio of the<br />3 inventory to the 12-month average distribution.<br />4 DR. BRECHER: Okay.<br />5 MS. WEINSTEIN: So, just to clarify for<br />6 you.<br />7 DR. LINDEN: I just have a question,<br />8 because I noticed in her letter, she talked about<br />9 being sufficient for availability to patients, and<br />10 I don't know enough about this, but were there<br />11 concerns that with decreased reimbursement, that<br />12 people might not have access, and therefore, it's<br />13 not available to them even though there is some out<br />14 there, but at twice the price, they can't afford<br />15 it?<br />16 DR. BRECHER: Yes, that is the concern.<br />17 DR. LINDEN: I wonder if we want to get<br />18 that across, and she didn't just say total supply.<br />19 She said the supplies are actually available to<br />20 patients.<br />21 DR. BRECHER: Well, I think that gets to<br />22 the reimbursement costs with the prices going up,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (310 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />311<br />1 and you have to somehow match that, and what they<br />2 are currently paying is not enough, so that people<br />3 do purchase it.<br />4 DR. LINDEN: Right, but I am wondering if<br />5 we want to talk about this in terms of being<br />6 available to patients as opposed to just the<br />7 supplies.<br />8 DR. HAAS: May I just add to Jeanne's<br />9 comment that when Jerry mentioned he would make<br />10 phone calls and then they would become available,<br />11 that, to me, is an indication that the patients<br />12 aren't getting it.<br />13 DR. BRECHER: It is certainly a red flag.<br />14 DR. HAAS: Yes. So, I like the idea of<br />15 getting the patient.<br />16 DR. BRECHER: Meeting patient demand, is<br />17 that where we would put it in there? I yield to<br />18 the economist in the group.<br />19 DR. HAAS: I can go into the economist<br />20 jargon just like medical doctors go into your<br />21 jargon. That word has a very specific meaning in<br />22 economics, so I think what we are talking about<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (311 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />312<br />1 here is a need, and I would get away from the<br />2 economic term and just talk about the need.<br />3 DR. LINDEN: That is what Karen and I were<br />4 suggesting, maybe patient needs.<br />5 DR. BRECHER: Art.<br />6 DR. BRACEY: Back to Paul's point, I think<br />7 that if we don't hit this piece about off-label<br />8 use, I mean a big part of their argument is that,<br />9 well, you know, really, the reason that there is<br />10 increasing demand is that there are allow these<br />11 bozos out there using the off-label, the components<br />12 for off-label use, and perhaps we could add a<br />13 statement, "Although off-label use is a factor in<br />14 demand, there are a number of studies to support<br />15 the use of this agent in selected patients," you<br />16 know, something to support.<br />17 It just seems to me that their position is<br />18 that all off-label use is wrong, and I am not sure<br />19 that's something that should be left standing.<br />20 DR. LINDEN: Have we seen those studies<br />21 presented to this committee, Art?<br />22 DR. BRACEY: Well, not in the two times I<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (312 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />313<br />1 have been here.<br />2 DR. BRECHER: No, we haven't specifically<br />3 looked at that data, but I think a number of us<br />4 reviewed papers on specific diseases, and it's a<br />5 mixed--the evidence is mixed. Some is better than<br />6 others for particular indications.<br />7 MS. LIPTON: Is it really the issue of<br />8 off-label use, or is it the issue that we don't<br />9 think that off-label use totally accounts for all<br />10 of these disruptions that we are seeing?<br />11 DR. BRACEY: Yes.<br />12 MS. LIPTON: I don't want us to get tied<br />13 up personally in off-label use, but I think that we<br />14 could send in a message that although we recognize<br />15 there is off-label use of this product, we don't<br />16 believe that that is--I don't know what the last<br />17 words are--but that isn't the sole reason that<br />18 patients are not getting access to this product.<br />19 DR. BRECHER: Celso.<br />20 DR. BIANCO: I would leave it as is.<br />21 Patient need is not determined by CMS or by some<br />22 authority. It is determined by the physician that<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (313 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />314<br />1 prescribed, so I think it covers everything.<br />2 DR. BRECHER: Going once--does we need a<br />3 fourth point? Jay, you had mentioned a possible<br />4 fourth point.<br />5 DR. EPSTEIN: Well, I do think that we<br />6 need a fourth point, which has something to do with<br />7 the long term, and not being an economist, I am not<br />8 sure exactly what is the right thing to say here,<br />9 but it's along the lines of working together with<br />10 the Congress to establish a more stable pricing and<br />11 reimbursement structure for IGIV.<br />12 Now, again, others may get this a little<br />13 bit more on target, but I think that is what Point<br />14 4 is about.<br />15 MS. LIPTON: Stable and sustainable? I<br />16 mean we talked about sustainable.<br />17 DR. EPSTEIN: Yes, sustainable is good,<br />18 but the problem here is that you have got<br />19 dislocations of pricing and reimbursement that are<br />20 resulting in disruptions in the care system<br />21 including distribution and access, and that it's a<br />22 reflection of the legal construct presently in<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (314 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />315<br />1 place.<br />2 I think we have to recognize that the<br />3 Department, under the present law, is only capable<br />4 of the bandaid fixes, and that what is really<br />5 needed is for Congress to re-examine the system.<br />6 You know, Congress had a legitimate goal<br />7 of cost containment, but in this particular area,<br />8 it has had an unanticipated negative effect, and I<br />9 think what we are asking for is for the Department<br />10 to work with the Congress to achieve a more stable<br />11 and sustainable pricing and reimbursement scheme.<br />12 DR. BRECHER: I used the word<br />13 "government," but that would encompass Congress.<br />14 DR. EPSTEIN: Well, again, we are advisory<br />15 to the Secretary, and the Secretary has the ability<br />16 to lobby the Congress and introduce legislative<br />17 initiatives. The agencies do not, incidentally,<br />18 CMS cannot do this, but the Secretary can do this.<br />19 So, I think that is really what we want to<br />20 ask for.<br />21 MS. VOGEL: Can I make a suggestion? I<br />22 mean there is one vehicle that can be used during<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (315 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />316<br />1 the fall, and that is reconciliation where we can<br />2 make the changes to the reimbursement structure for<br />3 IVIG, so it can be, you know, that the committee<br />4 recommends that the Secretary work with Congress<br />5 during reconciliation to establish a long-term<br />6 stable and sustainable reimbursement structure for<br />7 IVIG, something like that, because this is a<br />8 vehicle that can be done during the fall.<br />9 DR. BRECHER: So, you are suggesting that<br />10 HHS should work with Congress?<br />11 MS. VOGEL: During reconciliation.<br />12 DR. EPSTEIN: Could I just suggest that<br />13 where you are saying as a short-term measure<br />14 because reconciliation is a presently available<br />15 mechanism, but there are other ways, too. I mean<br />16 they could just introduce new legislation. I am<br />17 not sure that we want to narrow it. Maybe that's a<br />18 subpoint.<br />19 MS. VOGEL: Yes, I mean the only thing,<br />20 just looking at the climate, Congress doesn't want<br />21 to open up the MMA, so this is a way to be able to<br />22 make a fix for a specific problem, such as IVIG,<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (316 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />317<br />1 which is a unique problem that is not occurring in<br />2 all the other products.<br />3 If we want to even mention the uniqueness,<br />4 and I know with Amy Pisano, when she testified in<br />5 May, she said, you know, of all the 450 products<br />6 out there, IVIG is the one product that they are<br />7 seeing problems with.<br />8 But, on the other hand, they don't want to<br />9 pass a technical bill, which is typically where you<br />10 would see a change in the Medicare, but they are<br />11 going to pass a reconciliation act, and that is the<br />12 vehicle where this can occur, if you want to get<br />13 that specific.<br />14 MS. LIPTON: But it still falls under work<br />15 with Congress, doesn't it?<br />16 MS. VOGEL: It does, it does fall under<br />17 the work of Congress.<br />18 DR. BRECHER: I think we don't have to be<br />19 that specific. We just tell them to do it, fix it<br />20 somehow.<br />21 Paul.<br />22 DR. HAAS: Mark, I think we do want that<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT (317 of 319) [9/22/2005 12:17:02 PM]<br />file://///Tiffanie/c/Stuff/0919BLOO.TXT<br />318<br />1 fourth one to read that the Secretary should work<br />2 with Congress, so it's direct.<br />3 DR. BRECHER: Okay.<br />4 DR. LINDEN: Mark, that is not parallel<br />5 construction, though. The other things are just<br />6 second person, you need to do this, so it really<br />7 should be work with Congress.<br />8 DR. BRECHER: Work with Congress, okay.<br />9 MS. LIPTON: We already instructed the<br />10 Secretary to take the following steps, the last of<br />11 which is work with Congress.<br />12 DR. LINDEN: Really, I mean it's not just<br />13 strive to. I mean it is to establish.<br />14 DR. BRECHER: Right.<br />15 Is everybody happy? Jerry is not happy.<br />16 DR. HOLMBERG: Should it be needs, plural,<br />17 or should it be patients' need?
