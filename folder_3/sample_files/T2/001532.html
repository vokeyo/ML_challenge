    <P>August 12,1998</P>
    
    <P> Health Care Financing Administration<BR> Department of Health and
      Human Services <BR> Attention: HCFA-0047-P<BR> P.O. Box 26676<BR>
      Baltimore, MD 21207-0519 </P>
    
    <P>To Whom It May Concern: </P>
    
    <P>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of the Rochester area submits this letter as
      its comments and recommendations on the proposed rule for National
      Standard Employer Identifier (HCFA-0047-P). </P>
    
    <P>The key points to our comments are as follows: </P>
    
    <P>1. The proposed rule indicates that health plans are &quot;bound&quot;
      by the HWAA legislation to utilize only the FUAA standards, while
      employers are not. The language of the final rule must clearly state that
      health plans are not in violation of the law for accepting non-standard
      electronic transactions from nor transmitting non-standard electronic
      transactions to those employers who choose not to use the FHPAA standards.
      <BR>(&quot;Requirements&quot; section - page 32787, column 2) </P>
    
    <P>2. The EIN has a different business purpose from the group number,
      account number, policy number, subscriber number, etc.. The final rule
      must be clear that the EIN will not be a replacement for any or all of
      these above numbers.<BR> (&quot;Background&quot; section - page 32785,
      columns 2 and 3) </P>
    
    <P>3. The proposed rule is misleading in its statements that an employer
      identifier is routinely required on claim transactions submitted by
      providers. (Generally, this is not a true statement.) The final rule
      should eliminate all language that implies that the employer identifier is
      mandatory in any transaction set other than the ANSI 834 Enrollment
      transaction.<BR> (&quot;Background&quot; section - page 32785, column 3)
    </P>
    
    <P>4. IRS written documentation of the EIN should be updated to more
      clearly describe rules or protocols for circumstances where an employer
      legitimately has multiple EIN'S</P>
    
    <P>5. The NPRM language is both unclear and limiting through its single
      reference to HTML interactions. HTML is one of several current and
      emerging technologies that enable applications used in browser/server,
      Direct Data Entry (DDE) and Point of Service (POS) business scenarios.
      Although we support the position that these technologies not require to be
      HIPAA compliant, we would prefer that the actual technology (HTML, etc.)
      not be mentioned. Over time, newer technologies will evolve which will
      outdate this regulation. </P>
    
    <P>6. The EIN is not explicitly included in the ID card information. The
      NCITS 284-1997 standard health care ID card currently stipulates only the
      cardholder's name and ID number and the issuer's ID number, generally the
      PAYERID be present. We see no reason to include the EIN on the ID card as
      long as it is not required for the provider's claim submission. (Having
      the EIN required would force the reissue of ID cards when employment has
      changed, even if no benefit had changed. This would increase the
      administrative costs for the payer and burden the subscriber.)</P>
    
    <P>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule
      HCFA-0047-P. Should there be any questions or concerns, please contact me

    <P> Sincerely,</P>
