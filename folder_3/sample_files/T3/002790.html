<p><em>By Diana Lutz</em></p>

<p>Asked what they're up to, Ames Lab scientists Scott Chumbley
and Alan Russell reply that they're working on new composites.
But, they hasten to add, they're not working on what you think
they're working on.</p>

<p>The word composite carries with it some negative baggage,
explains Chumbley, a metallurgist at the Lab and associate
professor of materials science at Iowa State University (ISU).
&quot;If we go to a conference,&quot; adds Russell, an associate
scientist at the Lab and assistant professor of materials science
at ISU, &quot;and say we're going to talk about composites, we
have to quickly explain we're talking about a different sort of
composite and that our composites have advantages the others
don't. It's kind of an evangelical thing.&quot;</p>

<p>A composite is a mixture of two different, usually quite
dissimilar, materials. The strengths of one material are
complementary to those of the other, so the properties of the
composite are superior to those of its constituents. &quot;In
theory,&quot; Chumbley adds darkly.</p>

<p>The idea of composite materials is as old as adding straw to
clay to make bricks. Most modern, high-tech composites, however,
consist of a ceramic in a metal, a ceramic in a ceramic or a
ceramic in a polymer. Aluminum reinforced with fibers of the
ceramic silicon carbide is a classic example. The composite
material combines the strength and stiffness of silicon carbide
with the ductility of aluminum.</p>

<p>The Ames Lab composites, on the other hand, consist of two
immiscible metals (metals that do not form alloys), such as
magnesium and titanium. Whereas ceramic- and polymer-containing
composites can be cantankerous materials, difficult to make and
difficult to work, the metal-metal composites have the properties
that have made metals utilitarian materials since the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Like much science, the research had accidental beginnings. It
grew out of an effort to make wire of a niobium-tin alloy (Nb<font size="1">3</font> Sn), which is one of the best low-temperature
superconductors. &quot;It's very difficult to make wire out of
this compound,&quot; Chumbley explains,&quot; because it tends to
be brittle. So the people who were trying to make wire took
copper and niobium and melted them together. Because copper and
niobium are immiscible, the niobium solidified within the copper
into little treelike structures called dendrites. They were able
to draw that material down into fine wire because copper and
niobium are ductile. As the copper rod got smaller, so did the
niobium, forming tiny filaments within the copper. Then they took
the drawn wire and passed it through molten tin. The tin atoms
went right through the copper and combined with the niobium to
form niobium-three-tin. And that's how they made windable wire
out of a brittle material.</p>

<p>&quot;But while they were doing this,&quot; he concludes,
&quot;they noticed that the copper wire with niobium in it --
forget the tin -- had very high strength, much higher than you'd
expect. You'd expect the strength of the composite to be
intermediate between that of copper and niobium, but it was
higher than that of niobium. In other words, adding a weaker
element to niobium made it stronger instead of weaker.&quot;
Russell adds, &quot;Joze Bevk, who was then at Harvard
University, first noticed this strengthening, but very quickly
thereafter, John Verhoeven, Bill Spitzig and Ed Gibson at Ames
Lab took Bevk's work and expanded it substantially.&quot;</p>

<p>Many of the niobium ribbons in a transverse section of the
copper-niobium composite are only 10 nanometers across, which is
about the width of 30 atoms. In the as-cast composite, however,
they might be five microns across, which is equivalent to many
thousands of atoms. It is the fineness of the microstructure that
makes the composites strong.</p>

<p>Metals deform and ultimately fail because they contain
defects, called dislocations, that can move with relative ease
through the metal's crystalline structure. The ribbons strengthen
the metal by making it hard for dislocations to form and, once
they form, to move. Thirty atoms across &quot;is so small that it
is very expensive energetically to produce a dislocation inside
it, much more so than in a bulk crystal,&quot; says Russell,
&quot;and then if the dislocation moves, it can move only a short
distance before it hits a boundary between dissimilar metals and
stalls.&quot;</p>

<p>The search for a champion metal-metal composite is guided by
both scientific and practical criteria. But the bottom line is
that the scientists must beat the best structural alloys now in
use. For the aircraft industry, which values lightness, that
means beating aluminum alloys. And for the automobile industry,
which values both lightness and cheapness, that means beating the
strength-to-weight ratios of steel at a moderate cost.</p>

<p>&quot;That kind of limits the area of your focus,&quot;
Chumbley says, &quot;because they're not going to be interested
in anything heavier or more expensive than that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the most part,&quot; Russell says, &quot;we're
looking at the big three light metals: aluminum, titanium and
magnesium. The other light elements are either very expensive or
reactive.&quot;</p>

<p>Russell qualifies this statement by remarking that Timothy
Ellis, an associate metallurgist at the Laboratory &quot;who owns
half the world's supply of the rare-earth element scandium over
in the Materials Preparation Center,&quot; talked them into
investigating the properties of a scandium-titanium composite.
&quot;We just know this is going to be the one with the fabulous
properties,&quot; he says, laughing. &quot;Scandium costs about
ten times more than gold.&quot;</p>

<p>The team is having the best luck with magnesium and aluminum.
&quot;If someone were to come to me and say, 'Pick two systems;
we'll give you money to investigate thoroughly two of the 15
systems you've tried,' I'd pick magnesium-titanium and
aluminum-niobium,&quot; says Russell.</p>

<p>The magnesium composite is interesting because of its
surprising high-temperature performance. In general, heat
coarsens the microstructure of metal-metal composites, decreasing
their strength. &quot;However, we have one famous exception to
this: magnesium,&quot; says Russell. The two scientists have
combined magnesium with titanium, niobium and iron. These
composites deformed well, and their strength increased, but they
were no better than the best commercial alloys.</p>

<p>Then an engineer at a company they were working with suggested
they look at how these composites performed if they were held at
high temperatures for a long time. &quot;So we tried it,&quot;
Russell says. &quot;We went in thinking they were probably going
to coarsen and wouldn't do too well. Everybody was startled when
they were unchanged. These composites have the best
high-temperature stability of any magnesium metal ever seen on
the planet Earth, which seems ironic, given magnesium's
reputation for flammability.&quot;</p>

<p>Metastable aluminum binaries also look promising. &quot;The
two big ones are aluminum-niobium and aluminum-titanium,&quot;
Russell says. &quot;Last summer we got up to a tensile strength
of 1,200 megapascal. That's about 170,000 pounds per square inch,
which is equivalent to hoisting an adult blue whale out of the
ocean on an aluminum cable 1.8 inches thick. A typical commercial
aluminum alloy is going to fracture at 300 or 400 megapascal. A
really extreme, not-very-ductile, pushing-the-envelope kind of
precipitation-hardened aluminum alloy might make it up to 700.
Well, we're almost double that, and the composite is really well
behaved. So we think this is pretty neat.&quot;</p>

<p>A conversation with Dick Lederich, senior technical specialist
at McDonnell Douglas, provides some idea of the competitive
environment for metal-metal composites. To interest his company,
Lederich says, a composite must beat the monolithic titanium
alloys, particularly the titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy (Ti<font size="1">6</font>Al<font size="1">4</font>V) used in roughly 90
percent of their applications.</p>

<p>Lederich feels the &quot;aluminum-titanium and
titanium-yttrium metal-metal composites have potential for
airframe skins.&quot; Compared to the monolithic alloys if not to
other composites, however, they require &quot;extensive
processing,&quot; which is &quot;a major disadvantage.&quot; But,
Lederich says, the &quot;innovative group&quot; at the Ames Lab
is already considering several promising solutions to this
problem, such as 90-degree extrusion, which puts more
&quot;work&quot; into a piece than the normal extrusion process,
or, in the case of the yttrium composite, deliberate oxidation.</p>

<p>Chumbley and Russell remain confident that they're on to
something; they're as worried about the PR problem as the
technical ones. &quot;We're still battling a misconception when
people hear 'composites',&quot; laments Chumbley. &quot;We need
better marketing and a name that won't remind people of
expensive, difficult-to-machine materials.&quot;</p>

<p>When the writer suggests &quot;immisch metals,&quot; a
conflation of &quot;immiscible&quot; and &quot;misch&quot;
(German for mixed), the scientists reply by e-mail, &quot;We are
of the opinion that perhaps the perfect name for these new
materials (ahem, how shall we put this diplomatically?) still
remains to be found.&quot;</p>
