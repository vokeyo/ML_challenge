<H1>NERSC FY 1999 User Survey Results</H1>
</CENTER>

NERSC would like to thank all the users who participated in this year's survey.
Your responses provide  feedback about every
aspect of NERSC's operation, help us judge the quality of our services, give
DOE information on how well NERSC is doing, point us to areas 
we can improve, and show how we compare to similar facilities.
<p>
This year 177 users responded to our survey, compared with 138 last year.
In general user satisfaction with NERSC was rated higher than last year,
by an average of 0.6 on a 7-point scale across 27 questions common to the 
two years.  The
biggest increases in satisfaction were with the allocations process, the
HPSS system and the T3E.  See <A HREF="#changes">FY 1998 to
FY 1999 Changes</A>.
<p>
On a scale from 7 (very satisfied) to 1 (very dissatisfied) the average scores
ranged from a high of 6.6 for timely response to consulting questions to
4.0 for PVP batch wait time.
The areas users are happiest with this year are consulting services, HPSS
reliability and uptime, as well as PVP and T3E uptime.  Areas of concern
are batch wait times for both PVP and T3E systems, visualization services,
the availability of training classes, and PVP resources in general.
See the table that
ranks <A HREF="#satisfaction">all satisfaction questions</A>.
<p>
The areas of most importance to users are the overall running of the center and
its connectivity to the network, the available computing hardware and its
management and configuration, consulting services, and the allocations process.
Access to cycles is the common theme.  See the <a href="#overall">
Overall Satisfaction and Importance</a> summary table.
<p>
In their verbal comments users focussed on NERSC's excellent support staff and
its well run center with good access to cycles (although users wish we could
provide even more), hardware and software support, and reliable service.
When asked what NERSC should do differently the most common response was
"provide even more cycles".  Of the 52 users who compared NERSC to other 
centers, half said NERSC is the best or better than other centers,
23% simply gave NERSC a favorable evaluation or said they only used NERSC,
19%  said NERSC is the same as other centers or provided a mixed evaluation,
and only 4 said that NERSC is less good.
Several sample responses below give the flavor of these comments; for more
details see <a href="#comments">Comments about NERSC</a>.
<ul>
<li>"I have found the consulting services to be quite responsive, friendly, and
helpful. At times they went
beyond the scope of my request which resulted in making my job easier."
<li>"Provides reliable machines, which are well-maintained and have scheduling
policies that allow for
    careful performance and scaling studies."
<li>"Provides a stable, user-friendly, interactive environment for code
development and testing on both MP machines and vector machines."
<li>"It would be nice if there were fewer users, so turn-around time could be
faster."
<li>"NERSC provides a well-run supercomputer environment that is critically
important to my research in nuclear physics."
</ul>

NERSC made several changes this past year based on the responses to last year's
survey.  
<ul>
   <li>We more frequently notified you of important changes and issues by
       email: This year 95% of users said they felt adequately informed,
       compared with 82% last year.
   <li>We changed the way we present <a href="/news/announcements/">
       announcements</a> on the web.  (We have no
       comparison rating between the two years.)
   <li>We restructured the queues on the Cray T3E: the satisfaction
       rating for T3E batch
       queue structure  went up by one point (from 4.5 to 5.5).
   <li>We added additional debug queues on all the Crays: last year we received
      2 complaints in this area; this year none.
</ul>
Watch this section for changes we plan to implement next year based on this
year's survey.

     &nbsp; 28 responses</b>
<p>
I have an SGI that satisfies my visualization needs (for now). In the
future when I have larger data sets I may look into the visualization
support that NERSC offers.
<p>
In our work group, we've found that it is easier to do computations at
NERSC and move the data back to the office and plot it there.  It has
been very frustrating in the past when software changes and you are
forced to spend a lot of time reworking graphics. 
<p>
I use VMD to visualize my results. I have it installed on my SGI. 
<p>
I still use NCAR for some purposes.  More often, I dump the data into
NetCDF files and look at it with IDL using local (non-NERSC) computers.
<p>
I use visualization at the ohio supercomputer center (OSC) since it was
more convenient. the connection to nersc is sometimes on the slower side,
so I did not think it worthwhile to start thinking about visualization at
nersc 
<p>
Data explorer, run on our local AIX machine. 
<p>
For 3D visualization I use AVS and sometimes Mathematica on my local
workstation.  I also expect in the near future to use IBM Data
Explorerer. I also use a variety of graphics software for more routine 2D
viewing of my results.  This would include Kaleidagraph, NOeSYS, NCSA Image
on the Mac. On my workstation I use PLPLOT, NCSA Image and NCAR graphics.
<p>
IDL on my desktop machine 
<p>
MATLAB at home institute. 
<p>
IDL and AVS<br> Visualization is done at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory
<p>
We have enough software in our home machines. However, I will try to use 
visualization software in NERSC. 
<p>
I am primarily doing performance analysis at NERSC. I do most of my
production runs here at ORNL. 
<p>
I use visualization tools on my PC or workstation since it works faster than
remote connection (actually, I never tried visualization tools at NERSC, but
I believe that the above statement is true). I have visualization tools for
molecular structures and plotting on my PC but I am not sure what is
available at NERSC. 
<p>
PC spartan pro  
<p>
Usually I download data files and do graphics on PC 
<p>
I use Chem3D and Xmol locally after transferring files from NERSC to my PC.
<p>
I use idl on my local workstation 
<p>
I use IDL, but not through NERSC. 
<p>
I download my data and use the visualization packages I have here on my PC.
<p>
I am happy with my local visualization software and am not training in using
NERSC's software. 
<p>
Data are analyzed in my local platform 
<p>
gnuplot (for 2-dim plots), but I use them on my local machine 
<p>
ftp the results to my PC and analyze them there 
<p>
Occasionally, we visualize our data using a PC-based program named
Noesys. This is basically a modern version of the older NCSA "Datascope"
software. 
<p>
We use our own visualization, TECPLOT 
<p>
Just simple plots, using xmgr or Mathematica running on my local machines.
<p>
Have used SGI Explorer on our workstations, as well as AVS at NERSC to
generate cross sectional images and isosurfaces of 3-D data arrays. 
<p>
I use IDL on a local HP workstation 

<p>
<li><b><a name=general>Gave general description of what is visualized</a>: 
     &nbsp; 8 responses</b>
<p>
I display various kinds of slices of atmospheric data in several
dimensions; usually:  lat, lon, alt/level/pressure, species, concentration.
<p>
Molecular graphics programs to visualise particular atomic configurations of
systems under study. 
<p>
Our results generate enormous amounts of data and can only be analyzed
by careful graphical analysis. 
<p>
3D visualization of atom locations<br> Contour plots  
<p>
No. Generally our graphics involves only two dimensional (y vs. x) plots,
so that no sophisticated visualization software is necessary. 
<p>
Complicate numerical and analytical results need visualization analysis
and presentation 
<p>
Graphical plots of results for publication. 
<p>
Simple plotters do usually fine 

<p>
<li><b><a name=home>Use home brew software</a>: &nbsp; 7 responses</b>
<p>
Home made software 
<p>
Have used AVS and home-grown. 
<p>
Sometimes use private software 
<p>
NCAR for basic line plots and SGI graphics workstations with
custom-written software for more extensive visualizations 
<p>
Programs: AVS, xmgr, and self-written programs 
<p>
I primarily use a package, AmrVis, written and maintained by our research group.
<p>
PV Wave, and amrvis (viz software for hierarchical data sets) 

<p>
<li><b><a name=soft>Software used</a>:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>NCAR Graphics: 16 responses</b>
</ul>
NCAR graphics.  Simple 2D plots and contour plots, monochrome. 
<p>
NCAR graphics 
<p>
Many codes used by group use NCAR routines 
<p>
NCAR graphics package. 
<p>

I'm not sure what I'd learn from visualizing my results. I've seen some

<li><b>Don't need NERSC visualization services: 18 responses</b>
<p>
In general the network latency is too large to allow reasonable access to
remote visualization facilities. 
<p>
I am used to Matlab. A visualization tool on the local machine performs
better than over the net. 
<p>
None, really. It is much more efficient to run it on a local machine for what
I do.
<p>
None, I believe that off-line visualization (on my local LINUX
workstation) works better for my research. 
<p>
My telnet connection is usually painfully slow, and the best bet is to 
generate a graphics file at NERSC and ship it home by mail or ftp. 
<p>
See above; I don't think that visualization software is really appropriate
for the domain in which I am working.  But I'm open to suggestions!  :-)

<p>
<li><b><a name=avsh>help with AVS</a>: &nbsp; 1 response</b>
<p>
[...] Several topics I could use help on
with respect to AVS are:
<br> (a) An efficient way of writing 3D data out as
VRML 2 format for web applications.  AVS only has modules (contributed) which
write out in VRML 1 format and they write very inefficient forms of VRML.
I've seen examples of direct reduction of 3D objects similar to what I work
with to VRML 2 (without using AVS) which are much more efficiently rendered
in VRML viewers than those I've written through AVS.
<br> (b) Better ways of
getting my data imported to AVS. For example, I often work with non-planar
analytically described surfaces. It would be helpful to know if there is
software which would help one subdivide general surfaces into triangular
elements and then write this out along with nodal data directly into a
binary-format AVS UCD data structure. I usually end up either writing out
lots of 3D field data and then making an isosurface through it or writing
out the surface and then letting AVS convert the field to a UCD (it's
converter does not seem to be very efficient).
<br>c) Another area that I've found challenging is in doing time-series
animations of 3D data
coming from simulations. One tends to have to write time slices of the data
out as many separate files and then set up a loop within AVS to read these 
in and render them and save the
2D images again as lots of separate files. It would be helpful if someone
would create an AVS
module which could read multiple time slices out of a single file (or small
number of such files)
along with the code fragment needed in the simulation code for writing out
this file (or files).

We have recently had excellent support in porting a piece of our code that was

My initial encounter with consulting services was unfortunate.  I was having

as I was frequently monitoring its progress].  This was noted by the
consultant.)  Following this incident, however, I received helpful and
respectful advice from another consultant, and was able to improve the
application.

Responses from account services are typically rather slow.  I spent an
afternoon trying to assess the state of our account, having spoken with a

the NERSC webpage was at odds both with his misunderstanding and with the
true details.

The web pages for new allocations this year were somewhat confusing, in terms 
of listing old/new people and old/new repo accounts. 
<p>
for most issues, support has been very forthcoming.  But for one issue in 
particular, everyone in our group cannot seem to get response.  The inode 
limit on one machine (the T3E) is far too stringint for us to get much work 
done.  Support services claims to be looking into alternatives, but our groups 
waits and waits....

It would be nice if we did not have to change passwords so often. Fortunately 
consulting seems to know.

Improve the above.

It would be nice if the setcub view command showed the units by default so 
that I don't have to remember if they are minutes or seconds. 
<p>
I'd like to have a command within SETCUB that gives me the usage of all members 
of my repo within a given period of time. Something like: 
usage repo=xxx since=xxx end=xxx members

I would like to see a simple to use script that would track the jobs of a
given user on the SV1 cluster, instead of having to go looking for them with
qstat and other commands that require remembering a number of flags or
checking pages of documentation every time. Something like "Show jobs" or
"whereare myjobs"

<p>
<li><b><a name=improve>Could be improved / changed</a>: &nbsp; 6 responses</b>
<p>
In general, I think it's a fine web site.  I've occasionally noticed that
some information that one needs to check fairly often, such as batch queue
structures and how to submit batch jobs is buried fairly far down in the
hierarchy.  Also, there could be more cross-referencing between machines.
For example, having just checked the batch queue structure or software
availability on the T3E, maybe I would like to see the same thing on the
J90.  But there is no direct link at this point; I have to go back up to the
home page, find the J90 and work my way back down. 
<p>
I prefer the old website.  Fewer links were required to obtain detailed 
information on, for instance, the T3E queue system. 
<p>
The site is good and getting better. A few more links between pages would be
good. For example, in the J90/SV1 page, in the section covering batch, there
are no links to the tutorial pages on batch or to the page on special
considerations on running batch on the PVPs. 
<p>
Too many changes are confusing.
<p>
I find it a little confusing to have more than one site for NERSC. 
<p>
There is a lot of clutter which makes it difficult to use through a low 
speed connection. Huge pictures or many frames just slow things down enormously.

<h4>How could we improve our web site? &nbsp; 25 responses</h4>

<ul>
<li><b><a name=org>Improve its organization and searching abilities</a>: &nbsp;
    6 responses</b>
<p>
improve the internal searching capabilities of the site 
<p>
Add an acronym list.  For example, if you didn't know what PE stood for, 
you'd never find out from your site, docs or search tools... 
<p>
The information most important for users should be easily located.  The
content of the website suffers from, if anything, overabundance.  This
degrades the quality of searches (often locating irrelevant information).
Perhaps a clearer organization of material would be helpful. 
<p>
One way is to steer the users directly into  the areas, which they are
looking for, rather than going though a long windy way, if possible.
<p>
My impression is that it is still somewhat difficult to get specific questions
regarding the F90 language/compiler answered without going through reams
of Web pages
<p>
Make it as organized and logically-structured as you possibly can. 

<p>
<li><b><a name=opt>Provide more optimization info</a>: &nbsp; 3 responses</b>
<p>
I'd like to see more information on Fortran 90.  I would very much like to
see optimization information in a more accessible format.  Some tricks for
improving my codes (such as using E-registers and Cray pointers) were not
very easy to figure out from the documentation on the web.  The
information on SHMEM as it relates to optimizing MPI code is useful but could
be expanded and made more accessible. 
<p>
Put some more technical info about hardware back on the site; things like
vector lengths, etc.  SGI's website are fairly useless nowdays for this kind
of info, which can often be quite helpful when you need to squeeze out a few
more GFLOPs.
<p>
provide direct access to performance tuning aspects 

<p>
<li><b><a name=soft>Better software documentation</a>: &nbsp; 2 responses</b>
<p>
I would appreciate ONE page somewhere on the web containing a short
reference of the most important commands and its flags, queue limits and
whatever one tends to forget from one login to the other. 
<p>
documentation on using the BLAS and LAPACK libraries are a little
incomplete (e.g., it took me a while to realize that only "single"
precision routines are relevant/available). 

<p>
<li><b><a name=www>Comments pertaining to www.nersc.gov</a>: &nbsp; 2
    responses</b>
<p>
Your old web site: www.nersc.gov still exists.  This is somewhat confusing to
users why you maintain these two web-sites. Why don't you merge them or at
least put a very visible link on www.nersc.gov to redirect us to
hpcf.nersc.gov given that most of us find www.nersc.gov is easier to remember
than hpcf.nersc.gov. 
<p>
If you have a slow link, loading the home page with all of its graphics takes 
a long while. Reduce the glitz.

<p>
<li><b><a name=other>Other suggestions</a>: &nbsp; 6 responses</b>
<p>
It would be nice if the website could be updated within minutes when machines
are unavailable.  Yesterday, for instance, I was trying to log into mcurie,
but I could not, even though it was not a scheduled downtime.  I looked at
the news section of the website, but didn't see anything.  I couldn't figure
out if it was my network connection or something else.  A message posted in
the news section would have been nice.
<p>
The web site could be improved if there were a way to setup, submit and  
monitor jobs on the NERSC machines via an online HTML interface. 
<p>
Some suggestion I have for most web sites I visit......Don't change it's 
configuration and design so often.  Many times, after I find something, 
it's not in the same place the next time I go to look for it. 
<p>
I'd like to see the seminars and talks that you organize better advertised.
<p>
 1- Take out web passwords.
<br> 2- Open up user discussion and suggestion boards
<br> 3- Users-help-Users section? <br><p>
<p>
Make access as semaless as possible even over low speed connections <br><p>

important messages via e-mail, other on the web 
<p>
In general, email notices are the best 
<p>
I think e-mail is the quickest method to communicate any changes,etc.
because one may not sign daily to NERSC computers and may miss MOT,etc.
Of course, sending e-mail can be a problem. But it would work and not
useful e-mail could be deleted in due course.

<p>
Simplify all the generic logon warnings and add brief bulletins to the

scroll by twice.)

<p>
[...] The "news' banner that scrolls by at supersonic speed upon

<p>
The message of the day is way, way, way too long. You should have a short
MOTD and then put news into the "news" system. The latter is completely
neglected and that's a mistake. "News" is a great way to inform users.

It would be nice to know more about planned hardware and software acquisitions

<p>
If a truly major change is planned, one month notice might be insufficient in
some cases. I suggest it might be useful to have a "comment period"
before final decisions on made truly major changes  (e.g. dropping a
widely used graphics library, changing the queue system).

The times for maintenance are awkward. On mcurie, 16:00 to 21:00 are just bad
times of the day. Also, having the shut down either tuesday or thursday is
confusing. The notification is adequate, it would just be easier if always
on the same day.

<p>
the best supercomputer I know of 
<p>
Nice machine ! 
<p>
It is definitely a very stable and reliable machine!!! 
<p>
I like the machine, and it is helpful to my work. 
<p>
Ideally, it would be good to have more T3E's so that more projects could be 
awarded greater than 10**5 processor hrs./year.
<p>
Good scalability. [...]
<p>
The machine is extremely useful in the amount of production time that is 
available on it, however it is out of date as a massively parallel 
supercomputer.

<p>
<li><b><a name=queues>Comments on queue structure</a>: &nbsp; 7 responses</b>
<p>
I'd like to have a long 512-processor queue 
<p>
Batch queues that run longer than 4 hours would be nice.  12 hours would make
many of my jobs easier to run and manage.  Some things just can't be done in
4 hour segments. 
<p>
Some jobs in the production queue start fairly quickly.  The pe128 especially
seems to be under utilized.   But for long jobs, the wait can the long.  In
one case I launched a job on gc128 and was disappointed by the slow turn
around.  The jobs started the evening after I submitted, then ran a couple of
hours for the next two nights.  The results were not ready for 3 days.  I
would have been better off, I think, if I submitted multiple jobs in the
production queues.   <br> I've never tried more than 256 processors, but I
could.  I have some problems that I would like to solve that are too large
for the current queue configurations.  I am confident that my code will scale
past 256. 
<p>
Time limits per job seem to be too restrictive for long jobs, but that
require few processors. For example, the T3E system allows a time limit
of 4:10 h for jobs with less that 64 processors. 
<p>
Climate modeling requires very long runs. In general, the queue structure
is inappropriate for these multi-month calculations.
<p>
As a "naive" user, I do not know what the possibilities or alternatives 
might be with regard to batch turn-around time. I would like to be able
to run batch jobs longer than 4 hours with fewer than 64 processor
<p>
It would be good to be able to run a job for longer time, say 24 hours, 
maybe with smaller number of processors (4-64). 

<p>
<li><b><a name=thru>Comments on throughput, performance</a>:

Recently the queue wait time has been a real problem. 
<p>
The batch job wait time is too slow 
<p>
Too more users on MCURIE 
<p>
[...]Batch jobs are sometimes slow getting into and through the
queues.  This tends to lead to heavy interactive use to get adequate response
time.  My jobs tend to grow in time and thus require increasing numbers of
processors.  This is difficult to manage with slow queues.
<p>
good turnaround; few down times
<p>
Very high throughput compensates for lack of speed. [...]

<p>
<li><b><a name=inter>Comments on interactive computing</a>: 
    &nbsp; 6 responses</b>
<p>
Interactive and network performance are poor.  [...]
<p>
I asked my postdoc.  His main complaint was with the inability to run
small jobs interactively when two big jobs were doing so.  Maybe some 
sort of queue where a new job can take at most half of the available
processors. 
<p>
I know it's very hard to set up this architecture to run with multiple jobs
like a PVP --- but some interactive use of many processors would help
debugging.
<p>
If possible, keep a small number of processors available for debugging 
after midnight.
<p>
I find the ability to run parallel jobs interactively is particularly useful
as I am developing a parallel code and this makes debugging a lot easier
compared with some other systems that I use. 
<p>
Do a lot of my work on your T3E because I can run small test
interactively, as well as have access to totalview.  This is probably THE
most important thing for me.  Do not like it when mcurie is not available
after 4 pm on some weekdays, but can live with it.  Don't run  batch jobs
very often, other people in the group do that.

[...] The
/usr/tmp/ disks are lately full enough that one has to take special measures
with large datasets to avoid having a PE hang in an I/O cycle.  Richard
Gerber helped me with this problem, and knows what I am talking about.<br>
The NERSC implementation of AFS is not user friendly.  I have given up on it,
and find this annoying.  I never figured out how (from a NERSC computer) to
access AFS directories that belonged to a different user -- sharing code
development directories with other users is one of the main reasons I use(d)
AFS.
<p>
[...] The limitation on the
number of files allowed in the home area is very restrictive as compared
to the limitation on memory used.
<p>
Storage restrictions, in particular inode restrictions, seem somewhat 
more restrictive than is necessary.
<p>
inode limits, especially in temp seem weird.  also, what exactly do the 
previously two questions mean?? 
<p>
In general, the inode limitations on temporary and home disk space are very
restrictive.  Having limits on the number of inodes used seems excessively
limiting.  Good configuration of the drive space shouldn't require these type
limitations. [...]

[...] Would like access to more performance tuning on single
node performance (e.g. a quick reference on best set of compile flags for
good performance). The Cray documentation is either too verbose or do not
give any information at all. 
<p>
mcurie has been up and down a lot lately, but mostly it is pretty reliable.
It is much better than when new schedulers were being tested.  [...]
<p>
The queue stats are not very useful.  A useful stat would be something that
better informs which queue is best to run on "now," based on history, like a
year-long plot of daily Mflops/wait time, perhaps on a per-queue basis or
otherwise so we know if it's better to wait or try another queue.

PVM calls cause my code to stop with errors very often.  Resubmits without

<p>
<li><b><a name=no>No</a>:  &nbsp; 5 responses</b>

There was a lot on congestion on the J90 for a number of months following
this.  It didn't really seem like enough capacity was added to handle all the
users coming from the J90. 
<p>
C90 retirement meant that we lost the very fast f77 compiler and DISSPLA.
This has forced me to use the very slow F90 compiler on the J90s and much
code conversion to retrofit NCAR graphics. Also, the J90s are slower than the
C90 and could stand to have more interactive access. 
<p>
Wished the c90 was not shut down until full PVP cluster was in place. 
J90 interim had a very adverse effect on our productivity 
<p>
The C90 was a great machine.  "As smoothly as possible" should have meant 
keeping it on the floor.

<h4>Does the current NERSC PVP cluster meet your vector computing needs?
      - 52 responses</h4>
<ul>
<li><b><a name=nopvp>No</a>:  &nbsp; 24 responses</b>
<p>
no. I have to wait long in batch queues 
<p>
NO!  The batch queuing environment results in wait times (for me) that are 
HUGE compared to what I was used to on the C90!  
<p>
The PVP cluster has been very difficult to use.  In FY99 there were many 
times that jobs I submitted took many days to start.   
<p>
Not really. Need higher performance. 
<p>
No-no-no!!! if the waiting time to run batch jobs is any indication.  I hope
the new queue system is a big improvement because the present situation is
nearly intolerable. 
<p>
The jobs seem to be waiting so long in the queue that I am at present 
discouraged to run jobs. But I do need this facility for my computing. 
<p>
The system seems to be overloaded given the long wait time on the batch
queue. More batch machines might help (of course, that requires money). I have
heard of a proposal to turn one of the batch machines into an interactive
machine. Since there aren't enough batch machines as it is, I am opposed to
any reduction in the batch resources. 
<p>
No, it is way too slow. I work on many systems all at the same time, and
the CRAYs are by far the slowest to get out my results. And I mean by one
or more orders of magnitude. However, I am not exploiting the vector
capabilities so perhaps this is not fair. 
<p>
Very slow-- lots of wall clock time. 
<p>
batch queues too slow<br> need more capacity 
<p>
turnaround slow in recent months, but I recognize the emphasis must be given 
to MPP, in regard to resource acquisition. 
<p>
Based on the very long wait time in the batch queues (sometimes as much
as a week or more) there seems to be greatly too little PVP resources. I
also notive very large numbers of jobs submitted by one or a few users. I
hope the batch system accounts for this and runs only a few of those jobs at
a time, otherwise, it is unfair and possibly wasteful, to encourage
submission of many jobs. 
<p>
turn-around for large memory jobs is tooslow 
<p>
Batch is too slow. 
<p>
No. they are very slow. 
<p>
I do not use it much because my jobs stay in queue for a very long time (It
might be related to the end of the year). 
<p>
Noty exactly, needs to wait long time to obtain the result, sometimes the
compiler (CC) fails to overcome any overflow proplems. Also, need the prompt
to be customized such that the user can retrieve the previous commands using
the arrow keys. 
<p>
NO. MORE processors needed.SV1 processors are NOT as fast as they are
supposed to be. Account charging makes it even worse. I have no clue why
I am charged 3 times more on SV1 than I was on J90SEs, my code runs only
2 times faster! SV1 charging factor should be reduced to 1 or 1.2 . What
is the benefit of generously charging to users for NERSC? Total
allocation awards for FY2000 on SV1s is less than the total computing
power on the cluster. Repositories going over the allocation should be
automatically borrow time from the DOE reserve, as the process takes time
that users don't want to lose. It is a good strategy to urge users use
their allocations early in the year and take off some of it if they do not. 
<p>
No. So far, I have not managed to get better than about 180 Mflops out of
a single SV1 CPU. This compares with 500 Mflops for the C90 and 100
Mflops for the J90. I really need a vector machine with the C90's
capabilities.
<br> Multitasking on the J90/SV1 has problems of frequent
crashes and sometimes wrong results. Tracking down these problems is
almost impossible since there is no way of doing safe multiprocessing
i.e.multiprocessing which gives reproducible results down to the last
bit!
<br> The disk system is poorly configured, with insufficient inodes. It
needs to have its file systems rebuilt with of order 1 inode/5Kbytes
which is a typical value for workstations/PC's. The old 15000 inode quota
was totally inadequate: the new 5000 inode quota is totally
ridiculous. Adding a few more disks to the cluster would help. After all,
disks are dirt cheap.
<p>
Not a true replacement for the C90.  Switching one or two of the SV1's to
interactive use would help.  They'll be a small part of the total resource,
soon enough. 
<p>
I do interactive software development and testing now and then on
killeen.  Sometimes interactive response time is slow in the afternoons.
I think the SV1's are currently "batch only."  How about giving
interactive access to one of them? 
<p>
No. There should be one more box (SV1) available for interactive use.
<p>
NO...NOT AT ALL. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND MY GROUP. We need to have
at least 1 of the three machines devoted to pure interactive use. I recommand

The configuration is OK, but the interactive machine is often too busy. A
small persistent annoyance is the long wait to get job status info out of
cqstatl.  My main problem is my network connection - I have had
consulting help a couple of times on this, and it has always ended up with
you saying it's <br> the fault of the CUNY network provider and them saying
the delays are on the NERSC side.

Yes, but with the complaint given below that the interactive response of the 
J90se is often too slow.
<p>
yes, but note that the compilation is done on a J90 while the software is
run on an SV-1. Doesn't this slow the code since it is not compiled on
the SV-1? 
<p>
Yes and no. While it is good to have the faster SV1s available, I don't use
the machines as much as I could simply because interactive response on the
J90 is very poor. Simple UNIX operations such as 'cd' and 'ls' can takes many
seconds to happen. Also, I often use my codes in an interactive manner,
mixing significant computation with interactive steering. While it would be
possible to work this way using batch (i.e. submitting little batch jobs
between each bit of steering), the current state of the batch queues
(overloaded) makes that completely impractical. (Note that I do use batch
when interactive steering is not needed.)<br> I strongly urge you to make the
interactive machine a SV1. This would ease up the overload on the K machine
and make it much easier for us to do our work. It is inevitable that anyone
who makes use of the batch machines will also make use of the interactive
machine, for testing and debugging purposes. Putting that on the slowest
machine available impedes our work. Also, making the

<h4>Comments on NERSC's Cray PVP Cluster - 26 responses</h4>

<ul>
<li><b><a name=slow>Slow throughput, slow processors, need more PVP 
    cycles</a>: &nbsp; 15 responses</b>
<p>
The batch response is often slow, presumably due to high demand.  The 36
hour estimate above [for batch job wait time] averages 24 over the summer 
and 48 lately. 
<p>
Over the last 5 years have been solely using the scalar/vector machines 
at NERSC. In the last 2-3 years, shifted to the PVP cluster. In the early
stages stability of machines were very questionable - memory and disk
failures + communication between machines (loss of output). Bascially
could not run large jobs (memory / disk / time) on this cluster. Reduced, at
least for the past several years, to run simple short to medium runs on the
PVP machines. The point of NERSC was supply users to state-of-the-art
computing resources and thus push the limits of these machines. The PVP
cluster has failed to live up to the promise both in terms of software (OS)
and hardware failures. Maybe the SV1 will overcome these problems - see
answer to the above [since the SV1 is a new machine -
will hold my fire]. . 
<p>
[...] looooong wait in batch queues 
<p>
[...] The reconfiguring of the batch queues so that the
"nice" value decides when the job starts, rather than its priority during
execution was the stupidest idea to come out of NERSC since the decision
to replace the C90 with the J90/SV1's. The ideal is a system where the
nice value acts merely in the way it is supposed to under the Unix
standard, and the user is given the capability to change the nice value
up and down over the whole range allowed for the batch queues (say 5-19).
This would be similar to the old control command, but without separate
slow, medium and fast queues. As it stands, I sometimes have to wait
almost a week to get a job to start. I am tempted to submit multiple
copies of each job with different nice values.
<p>
It's usable but most people I speak with feel it should be avoided unless
absolutely necessary. Mostly because the performance is so poor. [...]
<p>
So far, the batch wait times hve been longer under the charging system
started Oct. 1 than they were last year under the old system. 
<p>
See above. [MORE processors needed.SV1 processors are NOT as fast as they are
supposed to be. Account charging makes it even worse...]
<p>
Currently, the wait time before jobs begin is completely unacceptable. I have
to wait 2-3 days for a job to begin. The date today is Sept. 28, 1999.
Hopefully, after Oct. 1 when the fiscal year begins anew, the wait time will
be less. 
<p>
These computers are not very fast.  I learned parallel computing techniques
to get away from using them.  I now use them only for diagnostic
post-processors that require NCAR graphics, which is not supported on MCURIE.
<p>
I have found the time waiting in the queue extremely long!!!! 
<p>
[...] but wait long time to get the my share of cpu time. 
<p>
There was a big backlog of jobs during the summer.  I haven't run any 
jobs recently so am not aware of how things stand at present.  
<p>
My only complaint is that in the last few months the turnaround time to
perform my simulations has gone way up.  When I first started using NERSC
computers (circa 1995), it took about a day to cycle a moderate simulation
through the 5MW queue.  Now, I have had jobs sitting on the queue for several
days before they even begin.

I think you should seriously consider making one of the SV1's the interactive

valuable human time staring at a monitor waiting for something to happen it
is worth trying to improve.

Possibility of running  batch jobs with  RAM of 200 MW, Disk 50 Gb , and a

the near future. 
<p>
The batch queue system functions but has features that really seem
candidates for improvement. The queuing system seems unpredictable and
somewhat unreliable.  Jobs seem to be scheduled in random order.  Of two
similar jobs submitted simultaneously, one could run within 12 hours,
skipping over several hundred other jobs in the queue, the other could
wait many days.  So, it does little good to submit jobs in priority
order in order to do a systematic series of jobs where the next step 
depends on previous results. Some users seem to be able to submit 100
jobs and have them all run very quickly. Occasionally, jobs are "failed"
because of a system problem and it is necessary to resubmit and wait
again several days for the job to start after already having waited several
days before the system problem was encountered.  When a system problem
is causing jobs to fail, often jobs continue to be submitted, all of
which fail causing the problem to multiply.  Finally, it

As a beginner, I experienced frustration with exceeded CPU- and disk

detect errors in the batch script.

I would be nice to have masget etc. commands we used to have for the mass 
storage before. These commands might exist, and I am just not aware of them.
<p>
[...] ftp interface a bit primitive 
<p>
Again, because I'm lazy, I'l like the interface to look as much exactly
like Unix as possible.  I'd like to be able to use foreach loop and
wildcards in the same way that I do in tcsh...it's pretty close, but
still frustrating at times. 
<p>
The FTP interface is a bit clumsy for many problems, and it appears that
the FTP restart command is not supported, so there is no way to restart a
failed transfer, or just get a portion of a file.  
<p>
More UNIX like interface is an improvement. 
<p>
It's good but needs some super-simple wrappers to allow one to store away
(and retrieve) a whole directory in one fell swoop. I can write these for
myself, but really they should be provided. For example, a command called
"stash" that just tar's the files in the current directory (not below!)
and stuffs that into a like-named directory in HPSS would be a great
help. I wrote such a tool for CFS but dare not try using it now without
careful attention to the changes needed.
<p>
[...] HPSS needs to be configured to send an
error flag to the shell when the transfer fails so that a batch job could
be made to crash when a transfer failed. Note, cfs was able to do this.

It should be easier to search the whole directory structure for files by name, 
date, etc.

[...] The f90 compiler [on mcurie] is very slow.
<p>
I am somewhat dissatisfied with KCC's compiler on the T3E for 2 reasons.
<br>1.  It takes a long time to compile, and a longer time to link.  This make
the debugging cycle extremely painful. I do as little code development as
possible on the T3E.
<br> 2. The totalview debugger does not work with KCC.
This makes debugging especially difficult.  
<p>
It would be nice if the latest gcc were ported to the T3E, but that may be 
wishful thinking. 
<p>
It is very hard to figure out exactly how data structures are laid out. I
eventually had to rewrite all my IO in C because the F90 IO is too slow
and the layout of F90 structures by the compiler is not helpful. [T3E user]
<p>
The currently installed Cray C++ compiler has a runtime environment that is
so archaic and so at odds with the ANSI/ISO C++ standard as to make it
exceedingly difficult to use with even the most modest degree of code
portability.  That might be a Cray problem rather than a NERSC problem, but
it is certainly a problem.  The availability of KAI's "KCC" C++ compiler
ameliorates this somewhat. [...]
<p>
It would be great if NERSC had a standard FORTRAN 77 compiler. 
<p>
The FORTRAN compiler on NERSC is very "non-forgiving." I compile my
programs on my NT-station (ABSOFT) with no problem, however, upon
transferring it to NERSC it will not compile at all. Sometimes, it looks
like  I am better off rewriting the program on NERSC than to debug it. [...]
[PVP user]
<p>
The SV1 needs fortran compilers better able to optimize for its 
particular architecture. Documentation on how to optimise C90 codes to
perform well on the SV1 is needed. The multitasking (OpenMP) software and
fortran compilers need a safe mode, i.e. one where the code is guaranteed
to produce reproducible results (to the last bit).

[...] Totalview is usually good [on mcurie], but barfs on complicated (but
standard) Fortran-90 constructs, requiring re-writes for some debugging
purposes. Totalview does not handle multiple PE debugging with total success
very often. The problems can be worked around, but a new version would be
nice. Managing memory, checking memory usage (for dynamically allocated
arrays), and finding memory errors in my codes is not very convenient.  If
there are tools available to help with this, please consider getting them.

[...] The totalview debugger does not work with KCC.
This makes debugging especially difficult.  
<p>
Better performance profile tool on T3E. 
<p>
[...] Also the debugging of FORTRAN does not come close to that of ABSOFT

As a remote user, I miss having a non-graphics based debugging utility.

<p>
I am not a fan of the Modules package.....Just thought I'd let  you know there 
is at least one of us. 
<p>
[...] Some of the software could stand to be updated
more frequently, particularly GNU tools.  Emacs, for example, is a pretty
fundamental tool for any software developer, yet the T3E version is rather
ancient.  That said, the system administrators are quite responsive to
specific requests for installations and upgrades.  I've been holding back on
some requests because I don't want to make a pest of myself. 
<br>More shells
are needed!  "zsh" and "tcsh" should be installed, and it should be possible
to set "zsh", "tcsh", or "bash" as one's login shell. 
<p>
I have to specify my terminal type at each login. 
<p>
Use more friendly environment, easy editors, such as pico. 

<p>
<li><b><a name=setcub>Comments on setcub</a>: &nbsp; 3 responses</b>

Accounting tools are rather cryptic. 
<p>
A quick way to account how much repo was used by each job. 
<p>
I find that setcub doesn't have updated account information. Twice I've
been fooled into thinking I have a larger account balance than I really
do, and then I unexpectedly used up our time.  Now I'm keeping track on
my own (or trying to) of how much time I've used.

[...] An MPI bug I reported was fixed promptly.  Thank you.
<p>
The best one among all I have used. 
<p>
I need to learn the basics of how to use a piece of software very quickly
and get on with my work.  If I can't do this for whatever reason, I
probably don't use it unless I absolutely have to.  I get the bulk of my
info from the on-line man pages, not the web documentation. 
<p>
Others in my group have beat through the configuration  aspects, so that
my code essentially works now out of the box.  I gather however that
there was a bit of pain getting it there....a long winded way of saying
no opinion, I s'pose. 
<p>
I think in the next decade, demands for an order of magnitude improvement in
the speed of hardware and performance of  software ,etc. would be mandatory
for any supercomputing facility like NERSC.  NERSC should start plans NOW how
it would tackle this mandate. Dr. Horst Simon is most knowledgeable in
this matter and I am sure he would cross the bridge when he would be close to
it. Dr. Simon at Boeing ( 25 years ago) and NERSC is doing a most magnificent
job! He deserves our sincerest thanks for making NERSC what it is today.
NERSC is undoubtedly a state-of the art supercomputing  facility second to
none in the western world. Congratulations to Dr. Horst Simon.

<h4>Comments about training. In what area should we focus our attention? -
11 responses</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>&nbsp; 5: &nbsp; &nbsp;Provide concise web documentation and online
tutorials</b>
<p>  
Easily accessible, concise information. 
<p>
Regarding online information, I prefer "cookbook recipes" rather than 
discourses.
<p>
Brief documents for every command and option, plus examples. 
<p>
Training is excellent for getting started. Please keep the number of
mouse klicks small if one just wants to refresh one's memory concerning a
command or important number (->"I have read this once, but where is this
page...") 
<p>
I've been happy with the on-line tutorials and NERSC specific documentation.
It should be a high priority to maintain them. It also might be useful to
provide PDF files with tables of contents and page numbers of the longer
tutorials because they are more useful as printed reference materials.

<p>
<li><b>&nbsp; 2: &nbsp; &nbsp;Provide web-based training</b>
<p>
I have not used any of these classes in the recent past. I occasionally
download some slides if I need to look into some particular issue.
<p>
web training .. I usually cannot go to classes .. I live in Ohio. 

<p>
<li><b>&nbsp; 1: &nbsp; &nbsp;Provide classroom training</b>
<p>
Off-site training held at major centers around the nation (ORNL,BNL,etc.)
would make it easier to learn about the most efficient ways to utilize
the NERSC resources. 

<p>
<li><b>&nbsp; 1: &nbsp; &nbsp;Need SP training</b>
<p>
We'll need training soon concerning the IBM-SP 

<p>
<li><b>&nbsp; 1: &nbsp; &nbsp;Continue as before</b>
<p>
Continue as before.

I twice filled out this form in its entirety, only to have Netscape crash
each time. Sorry for the sparsity of comments. Summary: NERSC does most
everything very well. I would like the mass storage (HPSS/migration) to be
more reliable and to have some inspection capability (if I've waited 30
minutes for a file to de-migrate, is it because there's a tape stuck, a
daemon not running, or just in a long line).

It would be nice if there were fewer users, so turn-around time could be
faster.
<p>
More processors. Less down time. 
<p>
less downtime, more forethought in planning changes (e.g., CFS
and the A-machine were removed at the same time. That took place
during a critical time before when everybody was scrambling to finish
other things before the holidays. Add to that the changes in the allocation
process, etc. As a
NERSC Account manager, I ended up spending 20 % of my time on NERSC
business. This was excessive.
<p>
NERSC should try listening to the users more. Among my co-workers,
there is rampant dissatisfaction with the CRAYs' interactive and batch
performance, but
nothing seems to change over many years. [...] [PVP user]
<p>
Improve the PVP disk system to give at least an order of magnitude more
inodes. Some increase in the total disk space should be provided.
<p>
A better handle on the PVP machines - the J90's were appalling - put more
pressure on the
hardware vendor for quicker solutions.
<p>
Up to the demise of the c90, I was very happy with NERSC. Forcing us onto the
j90, without
the PVP cluster inplace, actually causes us to look for other computing
resources, inhouse and
at the San Diego Supercomputing Ceneter. If you get the PVP cluster
returned to significant interactive use, we would be much happier. [...]
<p>
I primarily run Gaussian 98 jobs. Lately, the jobs just sit in the database and
never run. I can

turbulence code to the T3E (Bill Dorland of the Univ. of Maryland did this
for us). However, as you know, typical performance on cache-reliant
RISC-based MPP's is only about 5-10% of the theoretical MFLOP/CPU, while on
the Cray C-90 it was common to get 50% of the theoretical MFLOP/CPU rate. I
am concerned that the bandwidth to local memory, and the communications
bandwidth to remote memory, are not keeping up with CPU speed, and that the
promise of true multi-TeraFLOP performance has not been realized.  Perhaps
there is nothing NERSC could have done about it, but it is a little
disappointing that the IBM SP-2 that was purchased doesn't seem to be very
different in capability from the older T3E. We have to communicate to our
sponsors and to hardware vendors that many important scientific codes require
high bandwidth, and that sticking lots of PC's on an ethernet might be okay
for some problems but is completely inadequate for other important problems.
It is worth paying the extra money needed for specialty high-bandwidth
parallel supercomputers at centralized high-performance computing centers
like NERSC. I would prefer a 500-processor MPP with a very high speed per
processor to an MPP with 20000 slow processors.

To a user, it seems that the management of hardware could be handled in a way
that impacts
users less severely. The scheduled Tuesday and Thursday afternoon shutdowns
are interruptive and frustrating, particularly because mcurie usually goes down
at least once a
week anyways. However, as a system administrator for a workstation cluster,
I recognize that
maintenance is much more difficult than is usually apparent to users.

The accounting system mystefies me.
<p>
I like the change to default yearly accounting, the monthly accounting was a
headache! 
<p>
As a NERSC PI, I would appreciate it if you could provide access to better
accounting information. For example, I find a number of things I don't like
about setcub. It would be helpful if it would explicitly print out in the
"user time remaining" and "charge time" columns what units are being used
(i.e., PE-minutes, PE-hours) and over what time period the time remaining
units apply (e.g., month's or year's allocation). This is confusing to users
and tends to make them ignore setcub. Another capability which would be
helpful to account managers would be if you would provide access to time
history information by account and user; i.e., usage on a daily basis
through the whole year which I could download into a spreadsheet for plotting
and to extrapolate at what rate we're using up our time and check which users
are burning it up most rapidly and if usage patterns have changed over
time.  Obviously, I could run setcub every day and collect this information
myself, but that's a pain.
<p>
[...] Avoid changes in the compiler software if at all possible. Improve 
notification when it happens
<p>
I/we typically run FORTRAN codes at NERSC and port the data back to the office
for plotting.  We like to see minimal changes in compilers, graphics 
routines, software, etc... Once a code is working, we do not like to 
debug it or have to troubleshoot it. 
<p>
[...] Also, I once requested that PGPLOT be installed on the CRAYs. This is
free software, super-easy to install, and generally a wonderful library. But
I got beaten down and told it was junk and would not be installed. In my
opinion, NCAR Graphics is junk, yet you support it and promote it at the
expense of simpler, better alternatives like PGPLOT. In this case, it really
doesn't matter since I was able to install it myself in my own area in five
minutes. But I'd rather use official, system-installed software whenever
possible.  and a terrific package for simple graphics.

<p>
Interactive computing with 16-32 processors can be very helpful
for some applications, even for production. I much prefer such
computing to batch submissions, but I realize batch is a necessity.
So do what you can for interactive computing. 
<p>
My work requires that I run interactively. I may execute a program thirty to
forty times a day, with each run requiring information from the previous one.
With the availability of only one interactive machine (Killeen), NERSC seems
to be strongly discouraging interactive use.  There are several batch
machines and those are always the ones that get the improvements and upgrades
first. If it is NERSC's policy to minimize interactive computing , then that
policy and reasons for it should be clearly stated.
<p>
NERSC should try listening to the users more. Among my co-workers,
there is rampant dissatisfaction with the CRAYs' interactive and batch
performance, but
nothing seems to change over many years. [...] [PVP user]
<p>
I would appreciate very much if you could extend the interactive hours use. We
would like to have ,at least some, processors at night, between 10 and one 
at night. 
<p>
I think NERSC should heavily penalize people who use the facility
interactively. There has been some recent suggestion that it be made more
interactive and I strongly oppose that move.
<p>
Enforce the interactive usage policy on mcurie automatically (i.e., with
software).

NERSC is probably the best center in terms of user support, meaning
