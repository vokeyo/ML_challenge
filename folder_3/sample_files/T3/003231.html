<P><B>CHAIRS:</B></P>

<A NAME="LIHO_1062"></A>
<P><U>Plank Bottom Wooden Side Chairs</U> Two, one in the Lincoln Home
Collection (LIHO 1062) and the other in the Oldroyd Collection</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">LIHO 1062 was transferred to the Lincoln Home from
Ford's Theater. One chair, a painted, plank bottomed side chair, with
flowers on the top rail and back splat, is said to have been used in the
Lincoln dining room. The second, a matching plank bottom chair, remained
in the Oldroyd Collection (location unknown in 1980). Coe's 1896
<U>Descriptive Catalogue</U> of the Oldroyd Collection described them as
"No. 9. Chair, common wooden, used by the family in the dining-room,
Lincoln homestead." No. 10, chair, same as the preceding." No other
documentation has yet been found, and Coe gives no information as to how
Oldroyd acquired the chairs or from whom. Although these chairs may be
Lincoln associated chairs, the evidence to support that claim is very
slim and, therefore, they should be listed only tentatively with those
items having a much stronger provenance.</P>

<P><U>Rocking Chair</U> Upholstered in Black Horsehair (LIHO 38)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> This chair should not be listed with the original
Lincoln home items; however, it has a Lincoln association. According to
the Pickarel family of Springfield, this chair was "Lincoln's favorite"
when he visited them. The chair was donated to the Home by a Pickarel
grandson, George Pasfield.</P>

<A NAME="LIHO_126"></A>
<P><U>Rocking Chair</U>, ladder back with splint weave seat (LIHO 126)<BR>
<U>Rocking Chair</U>, upholstered in black horsehair (LIHO 94)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The ladder back rocking chair was acquired for the
Lincoln Home by the National Society of Colonial Dames of America
through the antiques dealer Lucy Rhea. The upholstered rocking chair was
also acquired from Mrs. Rhea. According to information found in the
files, the catalogue card for the ladder back chair and a letter and
statement from Mrs. Rhea concerning the upholstered rocker, both pieces
of furniture had accompanying affidavits attesting to their
authenticity. These affidavits have not been found. Both chairs
supposedly belonged to the Lincolns and the ladder back in particular to
Mrs. Lincoln. Without the affidavits, this association cannot be
confirmed. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Rocking Chair,</U> caned seat and caned panel on
back with four turned spindles and curved crest rail above panel
(possibly cherry) ca. 1840-1860. Located at Tuskegee, Alabama, in Booker
T. Washington's study at The Oaks.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This chair was given to <U>Tuskegee Institute</U>
(TUIN #24) with a history of having been owned by Lincoln. No records
have as yet been located to substantiate this claim. The chair, however,
is identical to the pair shown in <U>Frank Leslie's Illustrated
Newspaper</U> (March 9, 1861) drawing of the Lincolns' sitting room and
no other chairs of a similar design have yet been found with a Lincoln
history of ownership. It is of an appropriate style and date to have
come from Illinois at that time. It has been refinished and one piece of
wood on the seat has been replaced.</P>

<A NAME="LIHO_56"></A>
<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Rocking Chair</U> (LIHO 56)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The files on this chair appear to be incomplete. It
was acquired by the State from Mrs. Chester Dudley Tripp. The chair came
with a history of having belonged to Mr. Lincoln. No affidavit is
mentioned on the catalogue card and no correspondence relating to this
chair has been located. There is not enough information on this chair to
confirm the Lincoln association.</P>

<A NAME="LIHO_64"></A>
<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Rocking Chair</U> (LIHO 64)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The files on this chair are incomplete. The State
purchased the chair in 1956 from Mrs. Charity Coe Wood. The tradition
which accompanied the chair is that it belonged to Mr. Lincoln. No
affidavits or correspondence have been located in the files. There is
currently not enough information available to determine Lincoln
authenticity.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Side Chair</U>, balloon back (LIHO 787)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> This chair was donated to the Lincoln Home in 1973
by the Estate of Myrtle Burke. In 1970, Mrs. Burke wrote to the
Department of Conservation to offer the chair and at that time outlined
its history. She stated: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify"> Many years ago, I purchased from a dealer in
Jacksonville, Illinois, whose name as I recall was Caldwell, a chair
that had been in Mr. Lincoln's home in Springfield when he left there to
go to Washington to become President .... </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> This chair has been in my possession for a great
many years (close to 45 or 50) and was purchased by me from a young man
who dealt in antiques and he had acquired it from Mrs. Lincoln's nieces,
to whom Mrs. Lincoln had left the house and contents upon her death. In
my childhood these nieces had an exchange or gift shop .... </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify"> Mrs. Burke's account is questionable for several
reasons. No balloon back side chairs appear in the <U>Leslie's
Illustrated</U> drawings. The side chairs which do appear are of an
earlier style, the late Empire. Mrs. Lincoln did not leave the house and
contents to her nieces. After Mr. Lincoln's death, she quitclaimed her
rights to the house in favor of her sons. The majority of the Lincoln
furnishings were sold before the Lincolns' removal to Washington. Only a
few pieces of furniture purchased by the Tiltons remained in the house
and these furnishings appear to have been destroyed in the Chicago
fire.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> Mrs. Lincoln, however, did give away specific items
to her family and it is possible such a chair was given to a niece.
Unfortunately, Mrs. Burke was not able to provide further details and
the evidence is not sufficient to support the claim that the chair came
from the Lincoln Home.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Side Chair</U>, balloon back (LIHO 260)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> This side chair does not have a Lincoln home
association. It was owned in Springfield by Mrs. Lincoln's sister and
for this reason has been mentioned in this plan. It was donated to the
Lincoln Home by Mrs. T. F. Mahoney (Olivia Reid Mahoney). The chair
supposedly came from the home of Mrs. Lincoln's sister, Mrs. Ninian
Edwards. </P>

<A NAME="LIHO_31"></A>
<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Side Chairs</U>, Pair, Hitchcock style,
stencilled gold lines (LIHO 31 and 32)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">These chairs were acquired from Mrs. Hugh Morrison
who believed they were originally in the Lincoln and Logan law office.
It is possible, however, that they were originally in the Lincoln Home.
As the Lincolns purchased new furniture, it is possible that old
furniture was taken to Lincoln's law office. No affidavits or
correspondence were found in the files. These chairs appear to be two of
four Hitchcock chairs Mr. Hagen refers to as Lincoln chairs. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Chairs with Lincoln Association in Other
Collections Greenfield Village and Henry Ford Museum</U></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Ford Museum has a collection of furnishings
acquired by Henry Ford in 1930 from Ben and Dick Wilton, descendents of
Harry Wilton, U. S. Marshal of the Southern District of Illinois. In his
capacity as a U. S. Marshal, Mr. Wilton would have known Mr. Lincoln,
the lawyer. In fact, among the documents listed in Henkels' sale
catalogue (1894) from the Lincoln Memorial Collection is a note written
by Abraham Lincoln of an order obtained by Wilton for the Southern
District dated June 17, 1843, made in the case of Walter R. Bush vs.
Robert Allen. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> According to the Ford Museum, the furniture in their
collection from the Wiltons includes a mahogany empire card table with
acanthus carving on the lyre pedestal, a shelf clock by John Birge,
Bristol, Connecticut, six cane seated side chairs and six late empire
mahogany side chairs with acanthus carved front legs, decorative carving
on the splat and top rail, and hair cloth seats.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">According to an article on Lincoln chairs in
<U>Lincoln Lore</U> (No. 1318, July 12, 1954), there were also two
rocking chairs in this collection as well as six other unidentified
pieces of furniture. There is no supporting documentation (such as
affidavits or bills of sale) for this furniture and without additional
evidence, this collection cannot be authenticated as having come from
the Lincoln home.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Chicago Historical Society-Lincoln Home
Furnishings</U></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The Chicago Historical Society has a large
collection of furnishings, more than half of which are chairs which have
a history of coming from the Lincoln home in Springfield. Unfortunately,
little of this furniture is well documented. The following is a list of
those items (not already mentioned in the section on well-documented
provenance, if furnishings) with their accession numbers and known:  [<A
HREF="sectiond-notes.htm#69">69</A>] (Also, see illustrations 8 and 9.)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Chair</U>, small, painted brown, XA-2260, Charles
F. Gunther Collection. The Gunther Collection was acquired by the
Historical Society in 1920, and was not well documented.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Chairs</U> pair, slat backed, pine with black
stain, XA-2257. Charles F. Gunther Collection. These chairs were
reportedly from the Lincoln home kitchen, but were not well
documented.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Chairs</U> four, side, rosewood with heart shaped
back, Acc. No. 1920.242 a-d, Charles F. Gunther Collection. In addition
to the absence of documentation, these chairs do not resemble any in the
March 9, 1861, <U>Leslie's</U> drawings of the parlors or sitting room.
<U>Chair</U>, rocking, mahogany, Acc. No. 1920.243, Charles F. Gunther
Collection. No documentation. </P>

<P><B>FOOTSTOOLS:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The <U>Leslie's Illustrated</U> drawing of the
Lincolns' front parlor shows two upholstered footstools. One, supposedly
original, footstool is now at the Lincoln Home; however, unlike those
which appear in the drawing, it is caned rather than upholstered.</P>

<A NAME="LIHO_48"></A>
<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Caned Footstool</U> (LIHO 48) </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> According to the catalogue card, this footstool has
a history of belonging to Mrs. Lincoln. No provenance was mentioned on
the card. A letter located in Accession File No. 1, dated August 19,
1960, however, states that a footstool belonging to Mrs. Lincoln was
donated by Emily C. Paschal along with a "furniture doily." At that
time, Richard Hagen, Historical Consultant, wrote to thank Mrs. Paschal.
A caned sewing chair (LIHO 47), with which this footstool would be
appropriate, also has a history of belonging to Mrs. Lincoln. Without
further information, however, the footstool cannot be authenticated as
an original Lincoln item. </P>

<P><B>LAMPS:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Lamp Coal Oil</U> (Present location unknown) </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> A note in the Lincoln Home files, Illinois State
Historical Society Library, outlines the history of a coal oil lamp
supposedly owned by the Lincoln family. According to an affidavit (not
found in the files but mentioned in the note) signed by Mrs. Ellen
McCarthy Kent, Mrs. Cornelius McCarthy, Mrs. Kent's mother, purchased
the lamp at the Lincolns' 1861 sale. It was the McCarthy family's first
lamp. Mrs. Kent inherited the lamp and presented it to Bess Giblin
Earseman. Cornelius McCarthy was living in Springfield at the time of
the sale and could have attended it. In the 1860-1861 Springfield City
Directory, he is listed as a laborer living west of Rutledge and First
Streets, north of Miller. The McCarthy family history seems reliable;
however, the location of the lamp is currently unknown. </P>

<P><B>MIRRORS:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Mirror</U> (Chicago Historical Society) Accession
No. 1960. 100 </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> This mirror is said to have been purchased from the
Lincolns by Colonel George H. Harlow in 1869 and hung in the Lincoln
Home when George Harlow (Secretary of State of Illinois, 1873-1881)
rented the Lincoln home in that same year. George Harlow's daughter,
Georgia Harlow Whitacre, signed an affidavit, April 18, 1933, stating
the above family history and that the mirror was purchased from her by
Mrs. Jacob Baur. In 1958, Mrs. Whitacre's sister, Susan Harlow, signed
another affidavit confirming the above story. Mrs. Baur gave the mirror
to the Chicago Historical Society in 1960. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The provenance does not account for the mirror from
the time the Lincolns moved out of the house in 1861 (and sold most of
their belongings) until 1869 when the Harlow family moved into the
house. Without further information, this mirror cannot be confirmed as
an original Lincoln Home piece of furniture. </P>

<P><B>MUSIC BOXES:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Music Box</U> (Illinois State Historical Society
Collection) </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> A mid-nineteenth-century music box descended in the
family of Frances Todd Wallace, Mary Todd Lincoln's sister. According to
Mrs. Wallace's granddaughter, Frances W. Patteson, her mother, Mrs.
Patteson was given the music box by her Aunt Mary Lincoln. Copies of
correspondence relating to this artifact are found in LIHO furnishing
files. There is no evidence to indicate that this music box was located
in the Lincolns' Springfield home. </P>

<P><B>PEDESTAL STANDS:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Pedestal Stand</U> (LIHO 1098) </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> This stand was transferred from the Lincoln Museum
Collection at Ford's Theatre. According to their records (where it was
catalogue no. 3202), the stand was one of the furnishings Oldroyd
acquired from Miss Lydia Rockhill, a Springfield milliner and
dressmaker, who had purchased these items at the Lincolns' 1861 sale.
See pp. 59-60 and 69 for discussions of other artifacts purchased by
Miss Rockhill. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The major points of this history can be verified.
Miss Rockhill is listed in the Springfield 1860-1861 Directory, and the
stand is mentioned in the 1896 inventory of the Oldroyd Collection. The
available evidence, however, indicates this oak stand is not the one
Oldroyd purchased from Miss Rockhill. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> According to the Oldroyd 1896 inventory, the
Rockhill stand was of black walnut. In addition to this discrepancy, the
oak stand dates stylistically from the late nineteenth century. Oak
pedestal stands with applied decoration were popular household items
between 1890 and 1910. It is very unlikely that this stand was made
before 1890 and, therefore, it could not have been in Lincoln's
Springfield home. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> Since the provenance for the Rockhill stand appears
reliable, the oak stand was probably miscatalogued at Ford's Theatre, in
place of the original stand, which now cannot be located. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> In the stereoscope view of the Oldroyd Collection
taken in 1886, a stand may be seen and it is emphasized by a number.
This may be an illustration of the Rockhill stand. </P>

<P><B>SECRETARIES AND DESKS:</B></P>

<A NAME="LIHO_6"></A>
<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Secretary-Desk</U> (LIHO 6) </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The secretary-desk, now in the Lincoln Home back
parlor, descended in the family of Ninian Edwards, brother-in-law of
President Lincoln. It was acquired from Mary Edwards Brown who inherited
the desk from her father Albert S. Edwards who, in turn, had received it
from his father Ninian Edwards. According to family tradition, Ninian
Edwards purchased the desk from Mr. Lincoln prior to his departure for
Washington.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">There is a discrepancy in the records about where the
desk originally was located. Mr. Lincoln's office and his home are both
referred to in different documents. An affidavit (in the LIHO accession
files), sworn to by Mary Edwards Brown, May 2, 1925, states that "the
desk to which this certificate is attached... used by him [Mr. Lincoln]
in his law office in said City of Springfield." Unfortunately, Mrs.
Brown does not clearly identify the desk. She could be referring to
another piece of furniture. A memo written in 1956 by Richard Hagen,
Historical Consultant, to William Allen (Lincoln Home files in the
Illinois State Historical Library) concerning acquiring funds for the
purchase, however, reiterates the story that the desk was used in
Lincoln's law office. Hagen more clearly identifies the piece of
furniture by referring to it as a secretary-bookcase. The price
mentioned is also the same as that paid by the State for the Edwards
secretary-desk. The confusion arises because the purchase order states
that the secretary-desk was used in the Lincoln Home and the catalogue
card for this item contains the same story. Based on the evidence
mentioned above, the logical conclusion is that a mistake was made on
the purchase order and then was repeated at the time the collection was
catalogued, which took place in 1973, many years after the original
purchase. This secretary also does not resemble the one shown in the
<U>Leslie's</U> drawing or the one in the Tilton stereoscope view. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Secretary</U>, walnut, in two sections (Chicago
Historical Society, Accession No. 1920.240)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">No known provenance, said to have been used in
Lincoln's home.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Desk and Chair</U> (Chicago Historical Society,
Accession No. 1920. 920 a-b)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">No known provenance, said to have been owned by
Lincoln while he was studying law at Vandalia and retained by him until
his departure from Springfield. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Pine Desk</U> (Oldroyd Collection, Ford's
Theatre, Washington, D. C., Catalogue No. 3206)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">According to Ford's Theatre records, this desk has a
history of having been used by Mr. Lincoln at Springfield. No
documentation, however, exists to support this claim. </P>

<P><B>SOFAS:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Sofa</U>, transitional style between late Empire
and Rococo (LIHO 5). No material could be located in the files at the
Illinois State Historical Society Library or at the Lincoln Home beyond
information found on the catalogue card. The sofa was returned to the
home by direct descendents of the Reverend Dresser (the donor's name was
not on the card), who sold the 8th Street house to Lincoln. According to
information on the catalogue card, the sofa was one Dresser left in the
house at the time of the Lincolns' purchase. A problem with this history
is that the sofa would have been in the latest style at the time the
Dressers sold the house. Although possible, it does not seem logical
that the Reverend Dresser would leave behind a brand new piece of
furniture.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">According to James Hickey, Curator of the Lincoln
Collection, Illinois State Historical Library, the sofa was donated by
Mrs. Clifford Conry, a Dresser descendent, as a piece of furniture which
had descended in the Dresser family of Springfield. The sofa had not
been in the Lincoln house when the Lincolns lived there. The sofa should
not be labeled as a Lincoln piece of furniture. </P>

<P><B>STEREOSCOPE:</B></P>

<A NAME="LIHO_273"></A>
<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Stereoscope</U> (LIHO 273) </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> This stereoscope is identified by a metal label on
the front which reads "A. Beckars, Patent April 7, 1857, Jas. Lee, N.Y.
manufacturer." According to an affidavit signed by Annie E. Kavanaugh,
June 16, 1926, the stereoscope was sold by Jack Hough to Mr. Lincoln in
1860 and acquired by her father, Hugh Gallagher, in 1868. Mrs. Kavanaugh
does not state how Hugh Gallagher obtained it. However, it is possible
that it was one of the items stored in Springfield by the Lincolns and
Hugh Gallagher could have acquired it from Mrs. Lincoln after Lincoln's
death. When Mrs. R. W. Ide, Jr. acquired the stereoscope was not noted
in the records. Many of the Kavanaugh Lincoln items passed through the
hands of a Springfield antiques dealer, Lucy Rhea; however, in this
instance, it is not clear whether or not Mrs. Ide purchased the
stereoscope directly. It is not mentioned in any of the existing Lucy
Rhea correspondence. Mrs. Ide sold the stereoscope to the Lincoln Home
in January 1954. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> Since there are several unexplainable gaps in the
provenance of the stereoscope, the Lincoln association must be
considered unconfirmed though plausible. </P>

<P><B>TABLES:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Table</U>, occasional, marble topped, Renaissance
Revival Style (LIHO 55)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">According to the catalogue card, this table was
acquired by the Lincoln Home from Mrs. Bertha Gilmore of Massapequa, New
York, with a history of Lincoln ownership. The records for this table
are incomplete; however, stylistically, it is doubtful that the table
dates prior to 1865. Therefore, its Lincoln history of ownership (at
least during the Lincolns' Springfield period of residence) is not
likely. No further information was located in the files.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Table</U> (Present location unknown) </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> In 1953, Richard Hagen, Historical consultant to the
Division of Parks and Memorials, purchased a whatnot, a table, and four
pieces of china with Lincoln histories from L.C. Handy Studios in
Washington, D. C. (see p. 101 for discussions of other items). According
to Mrs. Evans, one of the owners of Handy Studios, these items were
originally purchased by Isaac Strohm of Springfield at the 1861 Lincoln
sale. Mrs. Evans purchased these furnishings from W. English who
provided her with their history. No affidavits appear to have
accompanied this purchase.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Proof of the provenance of these items is not strong.
They changed hands several times, and they did not have any accompanying
supportive data, such as a bill of sale or an affidavit by the original
purchaser. Unless further information is found, these items should not
be labeled as original to the Lincoln home. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> <U>Table</U>, Center, Mahogany and Marble (Present
location unknown) Information about the provenance of this table is
incomplete. According to the files, this table was given to the Lincoln
Home in 1942 by the Volicos family. At the time it was given, the table
was said to have been in the Volicos' family for fifty years.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Table</U> (Present location unknown) </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> Another table is mentioned in the Lucy Rhea
correspondence as having come from the Lincoln Home; however, the
records do not indicate that this table was ever acquired for the Home.
It is included here in case further information becomes available. In a
letter (July 17, 1934) written by Mrs. Rhea to Virginia (possibly
Virginia Brown, caretaker at the Home), Mrs. Rhea lists a number of
items with a Lincoln association that she wishes to sell, several of
which were acquired for the Home (see pp. 5557, 75-76, 80-81, 93-94,
103-104, 125-127, and 132-133) with the apparent exception of this table
and two pieces of fabric. In the 1934 letter, Mrs. Rhea described the
table as "oval marble top walnut table formerly property of Mrs. Lincoln
now in Springfield Art Association and filled with old glass cabinet on
top that had formerly belonged to Lincolns." A statement by Mrs. Rhea
listing four pieces of furniture was also found in LIHO Accession File
No. 1. Two of the pieces of furniture were supposedly from the Lincoln
Home, a rocker (LIHO 94), which was purchased from Mrs. Rhea, and the
above mentioned table. In this statement, Mrs. Rhea adds the information
that an affidavit was available although she does not say from whom.
Another rocker (LIHO 126) was also purchased from Mrs. Rhea according to
the LIHO catalogue and an accompanying affidavit states that it
originally belonged to Mrs. Lincoln. The history of this table is not
sufficient to state whether or not it was ever originally located in the
Lincoln home. </P>

<P><B>WHATNOTS:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"><U>Whatnots</U></P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> Two whatnots are visible in the 1861 <U>Leslie's</U>
drawings of the Parlor. The one in the northwest corner of the parlor
may be a triangular shaped corner whatnot, although its shape is not
clear from the drawings. One mid-nineteenth-century wall whatnot (now
found in the Lincoln Home), a corner one in the Chicago Historical
Society, and a whatnot owned by the Melvin family have a history of
Lincoln ownership. The whatnot with the strongest Lincoln provenance is
one owned by the descendents of Dr. Samuel Houston Melvin, a Springfield
doctor, who originally purchased the whatnot from the Lincoln sale,
February 9, 1861, for $10.00. The bill of sale signed by Abraham Lincoln
was kept by the family along with the whatnot and a wardrobe. For many
years, this whatnot was on display at the Oakland (California) Municipal
Museum, to whom it was loaned by Dr. Melvin's son, Henry Melvin. </P>

<A NAME="LIHO_24"></A>
<P ALIGN="justify"> The other whatnot (LIHO 24) now in the Lincoln Home
was purchased in 1953 by the Division of Parks and Memorials on the
recommendation of Richard Hagen. He found several items supposedly owned
by Lincoln at an antique store in Washington, D.C., the L.C. Handy
Studios, owned by Mrs. Mary H. Evans. [<A
HREF="sectiond-notes.htm#70">70</A>] According to Mrs. Evans, she acquired
the whatnot from W. English, who had bought it from Isaac Strohm of
Springfield, who had purchased it from the Lincoln sale in 1861.
Although Strohm does not appear in the 1860-1861 Springfield City
Directory, he is listed in the 1850 census for Sangamon County, City of
Springfield, as a 10-year-old boy. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> The whatnot (Accession No. 1921.7) at the Chicago
Historical Society also has inconclusive evidence in support of the
claim that it came from the Lincoln home; however, it is the only known
corner whatnot with a Lincoln history. The Historical Society acquired
the whatnot in 1921 from a Miss Camille Henry of Chicago whose father,
according to the Henry family tradition, purchased the whatnot from the
Lincolns when they left for Washington.  [<A
