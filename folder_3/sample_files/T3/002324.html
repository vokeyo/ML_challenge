<h2>GAS AND DUST WAVES EXPANDING AWAY FROM HALE-BOPP's NUCLEUS</h2>

1997, February 22nd, 6H UTC
<p>
We have observed the comet Hale-Bopp on February 22nd from 4 h 14 UT (at an
elevation of 14 degrees) to 6 h 51 UT (14 minutes after sunrise). 106
individual exposures in the z near-infrared filter were binned in 16
intervals of ten minutes and then combined to produce the 16 final images.
<P>
We present two animations .FLI of 16 frames. North is up.
<P>
The first animation is made from unprocessed raw images, just corrected from
flat-field. To obtain the second one, we have first applied to each image a
13x13 median filter, then substracted the result to the original image in
order to remove all the low spatial frequencies and to flatten the main bump
of the comet, and finally we have log-log transformed the pixel intensities.
The three last images were affected by cirrus clouds and daylight, producing
some disturbing noisy appearance. We recommand to play the second .FLI
sequence at 25 images/sec for detailed perception of the turbulent motion.
<P>
Here we have measured outward flow at 300-350 meter / sec, a good
confirmation of our preliminary value reported on February 17 in IAUC 6360.
Hale-Bopp coma parallel shells in front of the sun were first discovered at
Haute- Provence observatory by O.Lardiere and L.Arnold last January 30. We
have followed the phenomenon since February 2 at Pic-du-Midi, where day
after day, good "seeing" permits to resolve one arc-sec. at 10 degrees
elevation or 0.3 arc sec. near zenith. Here have a good "seeing" near
horizon is a main advantage to extend the observation window to more than
two hours.
The appearance of such concentric dust layers, named "shells" or "hoods", is
a classical feature in internal coma of great comets (see by example old
drawings of comet Donati in 1858 or CCD images of comet Hyakutake last
year). The nuclear spin is basically the cause of this time modulated
activity, one layer beeing emitted at each rotation, but many properties of
the phenomenon still remain unexplained. In our opinion hydrodynamic waves
seem required to try to understand the persistence of this coherent
layering. Indeed we are able to follow full delineated waves up to 100 000
km (out of the present field), about 100 hours after they have been ejected
from the nucleus.
The present observation shows for the first time a compact cloud of dust
leaving the nucleus at 300 meters / sec near p.a. 115 degrees. The main
nuclear condensation was of magnitude I=9, and this receding object of
magnitude 10. So they were both easily detected some minutes after sunrise.
This dust cloud could be at the origin of the waves system in the
south-eastern quadrant.
