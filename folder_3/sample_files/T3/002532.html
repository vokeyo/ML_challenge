        <h1>Fairy Tales Around the World</h1>
        <H3>Introduction</H3><P>Fairy tales are stories 
either created or strongly influenced by oral traditions. Their plots feature 
stark conflicts between good and evil, with magic and luck determining the usually 
happy endings. While each culture and geographic region of the world has its own 
body of folk tales and fairy tales that it considers "its own," certain themes 
and motifs tend to be repeated across many cultures and time periods. Universal 
human emotions such as love, hate, courage, kindness, and cruelty appear in bold, 
broad strokes on the canvas of fairy tales. </P><P>Because of the worldwide ubiquity 
of fairy tales, their imagery and tropes have had a vast impact on many different 
forms of literature. The elements and echoes of fairy tales are alive in plays, 
movies, and books for all ages. Students should read and learn to understand fairy 
tales so that they can better comprehend the structures of literature as well 
as for the sake of the wonder, pleasure, and human understanding these stories 
can provide in their own right.</P><H3>Guiding Questions: </H3><P>What is a fairy 
tale? What are some special characteristics of fairy tales? What kinds of plots, 
characters, and settings do we expect to find in these stories? What makes each 
fairy tale unique? Why are fairy tales so prevalent as a form of storytelling 
throughout the world? How have illustrations been used to make fairy tales more 
enjoyable?</P><H3>Learning Objectives</H3><P>After completing the lessons in this 
unit, students will be able to:</P><UL> <LI>Give a simple definition of a fairy 
tale. </LI><LI>Identify some typical characteristics of a fairy tale using literary 
terms such as <B>character, setting, </B>and <B>plot</B>. </LI><LI>Sort fairy 
tales into common "tale types"or "versions" and become familiar with multiple 
versions of several tale types. </LI><LI>Re-tell, in their own words, a few favorite 
fairy tales. </LI><LI>Use illustrations to "tell" a familiar fairy tale. </LI><LI>Recognize 
feelings and emotions within fairy tales that are common to universal humanity.</LI></UL><H3>Preparing 
to Teach This Lesson</H3><P>A Note and a Warning about "Original Versions" of 
Fairy Tales:</P><P>They don't exist. As you are selecting fairy tales to share 
with the students, be wary of getting caught up in a search for an "original version." 
Most of the European fairy tales in publication today for children are based on the stories 
collected by the Germans Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century. Their collection, 
<I>Kinder und Hausmarchen</I>, contains 277 stories that they transcribed from 
oral storytellers and re-wrote for publication. Because theirs is the best known 
and one of the earliest collections of stories taken from oral storytellers, it 
has the reputation as being the source of the "original version" of the stories 
most often retold in illustrated books and films.</P><P>In fact, Jacob and Wilhelm 
Grimm collected their stories not from peasants living in the countryside, but 
from urban middle class women who had heard them from their servants or nurse 
maids. The Grimm brothers published five editions of the <I>Kinder und Hausmarchen</I>, 
revising each new edition to create more polished literary stories. Besides adding 
colorful detail, dialogue, and transitions, the Grimms eliminated sexual material 
and added moral observations to many of the stories in order to make them (as 
they deemed) more suitable for family reading.</P><P>An additional complication 
relating to origins of fairy tales is the phenomenon of the literary fairy tale-a 
story based on magical elements and characters written by a single identifiable 
author. The literary fairy tale came into popularity in France and Italy during 
the 17th century, where it was a kind of sophisticated parlor game for adults 
in aristocratic society. Many of the literary tales were influenced by, and in 
turn, influenced the oral tales. For example, the version of <I>Beauty and the 
Beast </I>that is best known today was created as a literary tale by Mme. Leprince 
De Beaumont in 1757.</P><H3>Suggested Activities</H3><P><A HREF="#LESSON1">1:

Fairy Tale</span></P><B>Teacher preparation:</B> Choose a wide variety of fairy 
tales to read aloud and share with the students. Look in your school library's 
fairy tale section and browse through Dr. D. L. Ashliman's <A HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html">Folklore 
and Mythology Electronic Texts</A> website, available through <a href="http://www.ipl.org/">Internet Public Library</a>. Plan to include stories that exemplify 
a variety of tale types, such as "Cinderella," "The Fisherman and His Wife," and 
"Jack and the Beanstalk." (See below for specific suggestions.) <P>Read<I> The 
European Folk Tale </I>by Max Luthi (Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University 
Press, 1982) in<I> </I>order to gain an understanding of the special characteristics 
of folk and fairy tales.</P><P><B>Activity: Introducing and Defining the Fairy 
Tale</B></P><P>Begin by simply reading some of the above fairy tales to the students 
so that they can start to develop an intuitive awareness of this type of literature. 
For the young child, it is probably enough to understand that a fairy tale is 
an old story that was passed down by word of mouth for many years before finally 
being written down, and for which an original author is usually unknown.</P><P>Ask 
the students to sing a popular jump rope rhyme or counting out rhyme such as "Eeeny 
meeny miney moe." Ask them how they know it-did someone read it to them from a 
book? Of course not! They learned it from someone who sang it to them. Where did 
THAT person learn it? From someone ELSE. Does anyone know who the original author 
of "Eeny meeny miney moe" is? It's the same with most of the fairy tales we know. 
They were passed along and shared by people just telling them to each other for 
many, many years and sometimes centuries. Finally, some people began to write 
them down and make them into books.</P><P>Show the students the word "Retold" 
on the front cover of a fairy tale. Why does it say retold" instead of just "by"? 
Was Richard Walker the person who originally made up the story of <I>Jack and 
the Beanstalk</I>? No, he just put it in his own words and wrote it down and made 
illustrations for it. Some fairy tale books "cheat" by NOT including the word 
"retold." </P><P>Have students repeat the definition of a fairy tale at the beginning 
of each lesson: "Folk tales and fairy tales are old, old stores, passed down by 
word of mouth for hundreds of years, and nobody knows who the original author 
was." Help the students to chant this definition in a rhythmic way so it's fun 
for them!</P><P>Every time you read or share a fairy tale with the students, have 
a child place a pin on a large wall map. Keep a list of each country from where each 
story comes. By the end of this series of activities, you should have a wall map 
of the world covered with pins and a long list of countries on a poster. Ask the 
students what conclusions they would draw from these visual aids. Elicit from 
the students a recognition that fairy tales are told by many different cultures 
and countries throughout the world.</P><P><B>RESOURCES:</B></P><P><b>Examples

Identifying Fairy Tale Characteristics: Character, Setting, and Plot</span> </P><P><B>Teacher 
Preparation: </B>Fairy tales usually feature one-dimensional iconic characters 
and settings such as peasants, witches, royalty, villages, forests, and castles. 
While fairy tales often pit good characters against evil ones, moral teaching 
is not necessarily inherent in the stories. Peasants, abandoned children, and 
simpletons attain wealth and happy marriages as often through sheer luck and the 
fortuitous intervention of magic as through cleverness or good actions. </P><p><b>Activity:</b></P><P><b>Characters:</B></P><P>Brainstorm 
a list of characters that occur in fairy tales. Make a large chart to keep posted 
in the classroom. On the left, list each story by title and along the top list 
the various character types such as king, princess, peasant, youngest sister, 
cruel older sisters, simpleton, cruel stepmother, giant, and witch. Let students 
take turns putting checkmarks in the appropriate boxes with each new story you 
read to them. Make another similar chart for settings and keep track of the settings 
in each story. </P><p><b>Settings:</B></P><P>Show students pictures from books 
and magazines of a variety of settings including those that are typical of fairy 
tales (castles, cottages, mountains, rivers, and forests) and those that are not 
typical of fairy tales (apartment buildings and city streets). </P><P>Invite students 
to make a wand-waving motion when they see pictures typical of fairy tales and 
a truck-driving motion when they see pictures that are not typical.</P><p><b>Plot: 
</B></P><P>Make a set of cards with magnetic strips on the backs. On the cards, 
write brief phrases, some describing typical plot elements of fairy tales and 
others describing plot elements that are not typical.</P><DIR> <p><b>Fairy tale 
plot elements might include:</B></P><P>Hero (or heroine) heroine has bad luck</P><P>Hero 
(or heroine) must perform impossible tasks</P><P>Hero (or heroine) must fight 
a villain</P><P>Hero (or heroine) meets magical helpers</P><P>Hero (or heroine) 
is treated badly</P><P>Hero (or heroine) is in danger</P><P>Magic spells</P><P>Villain 
is punished</P><P>Hero (or heroine) is rewarded with wealth</P><P>Hero (or heroine) 
is rewarded with a happy marriage</P><P>Things happen in threes (three battles, 
three tasks)</P><p><b>Non-fairy tale plot elements might include:</B></P><P>Hero 
(or heroine) always has good luck</P><P>Hero (or heroine) is always treated nicely</P><P>Hero 
(or heroine) solves problems without any help</P><P>Story is realistic-no magic</P><P>No 
one is punished in the story</P><P>Hero (or heroine) is never in danger</P><P>Hero 
(or heroine) does everyday ordinary things</P></DIR><P>As a class, have students 
take turns placing cards on magnetic board under headings "Fairy Tale" and "Non-Fairy 
Tale."</P><p><b>Small group work:</B></P>Divide students in small groups and distribute 
easy-to-read fairy tales to each group. Have students work as a team to record 
the characters, setting, and typical plot elements that they find in their fairy 
tales. You may wish to do this activity several times, with groups focussing only 
on character one day, only on setting another day, and only on plot on a third 
day. <P><span class="contentbold"><A NAME="LESSON3"></A>3: Understanding the Concept 
of Tale Types or Versions</span></P><B>Teacher Preparation: </B>One of the most 
fascinating aspects of the fairy tale is the way in which recognizable plots and 
story elements reappear in slightly different guises in many different cultures 
and time periods. For example, the motif of the abused youngest sister achieving 
wealth and happiness-best known as the "Cinderella" tale type-appears in hundreds 
of versions from African, Asian, American, and European countries and as far back 
in written sources as 850 A.D. Browse through Dr. D. L. Ashliman's <A HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html">Folklore 
and Mythology Electronic Texts</A> web site to get a sense of the variety of tale 
types and motifs to be found in fairy tales.<B> </B>Browse through <I>The Great 
Fairy Tale Tradition</I> edited by Jack Zipes (New York: Norton c2001). This anthology 
organizes fairy tales by a variety of tale types and motifs. <p><b>Activity: </B></P><P>After 
the students are familiar with the typical characters and settings of the fairy 
tale, introduce the concept of <B>tale type</B>. Re-read some the "Cinderella" 
stories listed above and ask the students what is the same in each story. Use 
the <a href="/lesson_images/lesson387/CindrlaVennDiagram.pdf">Cinderella-Type Tale Venn Diagram</a>, provided in pdf format, and as a 
group fill out similarities and differences between two different versions of 
the Cinderella tale type.</P><P>See the web site <A HREF="http://www.ucalgary.ca/~dkbrown/cinderella.html">Cinderella 
Stories</A>, which may be reached from the Children's Literature Web Guide, available 
from the EDSITEment-reviewed resource <A HREF="http://www.ipl.org/">Internet Public 
Library</A>. Help the students to understand that a fairy tale that tells of a 
good and beautiful younger sister finding wealth and happiness after being treated 
cruelly by mother or stepmother and older sisters is the "Cinderella" tale type. 
This tale type has many different versions set in various countries. Help the 
students to notice that many of these versions feature a shoe, a doll, or a beautiful 
dress.</P><P>Then read a different tale type, such as Beauty and the Beast, The 
Foolish Friend, or Eat Me When I'm Fatter (see Folklore and Mythology Electronic 
Texts, available from <A HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/ashliman.html">Dr. Ashliman's 
homepage</A>. Dr. Ashliman's page is a link on the Children's Literature Web 
Guide, available through the EDSITEment-reviewed resource <A HREF="http://www.ipl.org/">Internet 
Public Library</A></P><P>Expose students to at least three different tale types 
with at least two versions of each type. Add another large wall chart to the classroom 
with several tale types and space for recording stories under each type. Have 
students draw small illustrations on the chart to go along with each tale type. 
As students become comfortable with tale types, allow them to work in small groups 
with two stories per group. Have each group fill out the <a href="/lesson_images/lesson387/TwoTalesVennDiagram.pdf">Two Tale Types Venn 
Diagram</a>, provided in pdf format, showing similarities and differences between 
fairy tales of two contrasting tale types, such as Red Riding Hood and Jack and 
the Beanstalk. Be sure to first model this as a whole group activity first.</P><P>Divide 
students into small groups and provide each group with a new version of one of 
the familiar tale types. Dr. D. L. Ashliman's <A HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html">Folklore 
and Mythology Electronic Texts</A> web site provides multiple examples for most 
of the tale types listed. Ask students to read the story and identify the tale 
type. Have them record plot and character elements that identify the story as 
a certain tale type. Use a T-chart to do this. (See example.)</P><P></P>

to re-tell fairy tales:</B></P><P>After reading and discussing a variety of fairy 
tales, have the students explore some web sites that feature illustrations of 
well-known fairy tales, such as <A HREF="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com">Sur La Lune Fairy Tales</a>, available through the EDSITEment-reviewed <a href="http://www.ipl.org">Internet Public Library</a> (to reach the illustrations, choose a specific tale from the main page, and then click on the "Illustrations" link on the left hand side). Be sure to read aloud at least one version of each fairy tale 
before taking the students to the web site. As a group, view the illustrations, then have the students decide which of 
two different illustrators' work they prefer. The final step is to have the students 
select three illustrations that represent the three significant parts of the story, 
print them out, and re-tell the entire story using the selected illustrations 
as focal points.</P><P>Having completed the whole-group activity, you can then 
move on to giving the students an opportunity to do the same task as pairs or 
as individuals. Have the students use a different fairy tale, such as <a href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/illustrations/ridinghood/index.html">Red Riding Hood</a>. Have students pick three-four key 
illustrations, copy them to a disk or folder, then retell the story in their own 
words using their selected illustrations as focal points.</P><P> </P><P><span class="contentbold"><A NAME="LESSON5"></A>5: 
Understanding How Illustrations Can "Tell" the Story</span></P>Web sites that 
provide access to many different illustrations can also be used to help students 
to see how illustrations can help to "tell" the story. Read aloud a version of 
<I>Jack and the </I>Beanstalk without showing the students any pictures. Then 
have the students choose three scenes to illustrate by hand. After the students 
have completed their illustrations, show them <a href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/illustrations/jackbeanstalk/index.html">pictures from Sur La Lune's Jack and the Beanstalk page</a>. <P>***Ask students to identify the illustrations within several different 
versions that most closely match their own illustration. For example, if a child 
chooses the moment when Jack is cutting down the beanstalk as the subject of his 
or her own hand-drawn illustration, have the child find the same scene in the 
illustrated versions on the web site. Invite the students to list details of clothing, 
color, setting, and expression that differentiate one web site illustration from 
another. </P> <P><span class="contentbold"><A NAME="LESSON6"></A>6: 
Recognizing the Commonality of Emotions Expressed in Fairy Tales Throughout the 
World</span></P>

<p><b>Activity:</B></P><P>Write down a list of emotions and ask 
students to share memories of experiences they have had with these feelings:</P>

<UL> <LI>love </LI>
<LI>hate </LI>
<LI>fear </LI>
<LI>loneliness </LI>
<LI>sadness 
</LI>
<LI>joy </LI>
<LI>surprise</LI></UL>

 <P>Distribute paper to the 
students with a grid of 12 squares on the paper. (Four rows of 3 squares). The 
words from the above list should be written in the squares, one per square. This 
leaves some empty squares for the students to add more words if they wish. Ask 
the students to make a small drawing illustrating each word. They may add more 
words and drawings to the empty squares if they wish.</P>
<P>In small groups, have 
the students re-read some of the fairy tales already read aloud as a large group 
or, for more able students, read some new fairy tales. Ask each child to place 
a check mark inside a "feeling" box whenever they encounter that feeling in the 
story. Have the students gather as a whole group and report back to the larger 
group some of the feelings they found in their stories.</P>
