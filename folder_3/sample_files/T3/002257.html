Moreover, the same  two corporate entities,<br>          along  with a  third corporation  likewise controlled  by Ferrer,<br>          previously had  filed a federal  court action asserting  the same<br>          claims against several companies  controlled by Pocklington.

Dismissal          A.  Dismissal              _________<br><br>                    At  the root  of the  problem is  whether the  district<br><br>          court  had  jurisdiction to  impose sanctions  against appellants<br><br>          following  the entry  of judgment  on November 20  dismissing the<br><br>          case "without prejudice."  Although the parties have concentrated<br><br>          their attention  on the  timeliness  of Pocklington's  unlabelled<br><br>          December 19   request  that   the  action   be   dismissed  "with<br><br>          prejudice,"4  we   conclude  that   the  Opinion  and   Order  of<br><br>          January 28 neither  altered the  judgment entered on  November 20<br><br>          dismissing the case "without prejudice," nor effected a dismissal<br><br>          of  the  action "with  prejudice."5   The  only directive  in the<br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               4Coming  as it  did more  than ten  days after  judgment was<br>          entered  by the clerk on  November 20, the December 19 motion was<br>          not  timely under  Rule 59(e).   See  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  59(e) ("A                                           ___<br>          motion to alter or amend  the judgment shall be served not  later<br>          than  10 days  after  entry  of  the judgment.").    Accordingly,<br>          appellants   insist  that   the   district   court  was   without<br>          jurisdiction to reconsider the judgment entered on November 20.<br><br>               5In  its "OPINION  AND  ORDER" of  January 28,  the district<br>          court  ruled  that   Ferrer's  notice   of  voluntary   dismissal<br>          represented his second voluntary dismissal of an action including<br>          the same claims against Pocklington.   Ferrer Bolivar, 137 F.R.D.                                                 ______________<br>          at 203-04.  The  court concluded therefore that, even  though the<br>          notice  of dismissal  purported  to dismiss  the action  "without<br>          prejudice," it  nonetheless operated as an  adjudication upon the<br>          merits  under  the  "two-dismissal"  rule  in  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.<br>          41(a)(1).   Id.  at 204.   See supra  note 2.   Nevertheless, the                      ___            ___ _____<br>          January 28  opinion and order did  not effect a  dismissal of the<br>          action  "with  prejudice" or  vacate  the  judgment of  dismissal<br>          "without prejudice" entered on November 20.  First, the "separate<br>          document" requirement was not met.  See Fed R. Civ. P. 58 ("Every                                              ___<br>          judgment shall be  set forth on a separate  document.  A judgment                                                                   ________<br>          is effective  only when so set forth and when entered as provided          __ _________  ____ ____ __ ___ _____ ___ ____ _______<br>          in  Rule 79(a).") (emphasis added);  see also Fiore,  960 F.2d at                                               ___ ____ _____<br>          237.  Although  the district court order entered on  remand was a<br>          "separate document," it did not take  effect until April 7, 1992,<br>          the date  of its entry, as plainly provided in Fed. R. Civ. P. 58<br>          and 79(a).    Second, the  January 30  docket entry  omitted  any<br>          mention  of  an  order   vacating  or  altering  the  November 20<br><br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Opinion and Order  of January 28  which was duly  entered in  the<br><br>          docket  on January 30,  1991, ordered  Ferrer and  his attorneys,<br><br>          jointly and severally, to pay Pocklington $5,000 in attorney fees<br><br>          as  a  sanction for  their Rule  11  and section  1927 transgres-<br><br>          sions.6   We turn then to  the only two questions  now before us:<br><br>          (1) whether the notice  of dismissal "without prejudice" deprived<br><br>          the district court of  jurisdiction to impose sanctions,  and (2)<br><br><br><br>                                        ____________________<br><br>          judgment, or dismissing the action "with prejudice."

P. 41(a)(1), it is irrelevant whether the district court had<br>          jurisdiction to alter the November 20 judgment.  Accordingly, the<br>          ministerial  entry  on  the   district  court  docket   directing<br>          dismissal of the action "with  prejudice" pursuant to the January<br>          28 opinion and order is all that remains to be done.<br><br>               6We reject  appellants' suggestion  that the  district court<br>          previously  had declined  to impose  sanctions.   Its November 1,<br>          1990, endorsement on the  notice of dismissal purported to  do no<br>          more than dismiss the case "without prejudice."  As the notice of<br>          dismissal  said nothing about  sanctions, the court's endorsement<br>          on the motion did no more.  Similarly, the January 28 opinion and<br>          order in no way linked the November endorsement with the decision<br>          to impose sanctions.

Both are  utterly<br>          without merit.   First,  we flatly reject  appellants' suggestion<br>          that Judge  Gierbolini's unrelated reference to  Ferrer's absence<br>          as  a named  party  to the  first  federal court  action  somehow<br>          invited the second federal  action, which was unjustifiably based<br>          on twice-dismissed causes of action belonging to the Villa Marina<br>          corporate  entities.   Second,  appellants frivolously  and irre-<br>          levantly  assert that  Pocklington's  employer, Hatteras  Yachts,                                 _____________  ________<br>          Inc., "did not claim  in the [Puerto Rico Superior  Court] action                                                    ________  _____  ______<br>          that Ferrer lacked standing."  (Emphasis added.)<br><br>               12Appellant Carlo is the only attorney who signed the Ferrer<br>          complaint.  Appellants correctly point out that Rule 11 sanctions<br>          cannot  be imposed  against  counsel  who  have  not  signed  the<br>          offending  document.    The  Rule 11  sanctions  are  enforceable<br>          against Ferrer, however, by virtue of the fact that he signed the<br>          verified  complaint.   See  Business  Guides,  Inc. v.

Appellants argue that the order<br>          imposing sanctions  does not "identify  by name any  lawyer [upon<br>          whom  sanctions are  imposed] which  is a  prerequisite to  there<br>          being  a final  judgment."   Reply  Brief  for appellants  at  4.<br>          Although  we construe the district court  order as rather plainly<br>          imposing  joint  and  several   liability  upon  Ferrer  and  all<br>          appellant-attorneys in  the sum of $5,000,  payable within thirty<br>          days, we recognize  that neither the January 28,  1991 order, nor<br>          the  April  7,  1992  order  entered  on   remand,  contains  the<br>          appropriate  direction that  Pocklington  "recover  of  plaintiff<br>          Eduardo Ferrer  Bolivar, and attorneys Michael  J. Rovell, Carlos<br>          G.  Latimer and Gerardo A. Carlo," jointly and severally, the sum<br>          of $5,000.  See Official Form 32.  We therefore remand for formal                      ___<br>          amendment  of  the  judgment  by  the  district  court  clerk  in<br>          accordance herewith and in  accordance with the above discussion.<br>          See supra note 5.          ___ _____<br><br>                                          17<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
