<!-- #BeginEditable "body" -->       <p>News Release (Backgrounder): 8 February 2000 </p>      <h1>Stereo Views: The Nineteenth Century Meets the Twenty-First Century*</h1>      <p>Stereographs were extremely popular in the nineteenth century. They consisted         of two near-identical photographs of the same scene, which when seen through         a binocular viewer called a stereoscope, created an illusion of startling         three-dimensional depth. By the 1850s, stereo views were a widespread         and inexpensive mass-marketed form of entertainment: a stereo viewer and         basket of cards were to be found in every proper Victorian parlor. Watkins         made more photographs in stereo than in any other format, inventing imagery         that made spectacular use of its three-dimensional effects.</p>      <p>In the exhibition, <em>Carleton Watkins: The Art of Perception,</em> twenty-first         century innovations have been used to bring nineteenth-century images         to the museum audience. Original stereo cards are displayed, and to optimize         viewing conditions for these works six computer viewing stations are installed         in a separate room at the end of the exhibition. Utilizing cutting-edge         technologies designed specifically for the exhibition tour to stimulate         the stereoscopic effect, the viewing stations provide access to approximately         200 stereo views by Watkins, organized by year, subject matter, and region.         Using special eyeglasses with LC (liquid crystal) lenses that synchronize         with the computer via a transmitter, the museum visitor sees the selected         images in three dimensions. The software interface for this unusual presentation         was designed by the multimedia firm Perimetre Design, using stereo-imaging         technology developed by StereoGraphics, creators of the stereo-viewing         system for Mars Pathfinder.</p>      <p>* Adapted from press materials produced by the San Francisco         Museum of Modern Art.</p>    <!-- #EndEditable -->
