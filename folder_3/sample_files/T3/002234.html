<P>Proposals to assist the New Mexico state Committee of the Experimental
Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in selecting focus areas
are due on Tuesday.</P>

<P>The deadline is the first of a two-stage process that will
lead to the submission of a National Science Foundation proposal
by the New Mexico EPSCoR Infrastructure Program.</P>

<P>In this first stage of the NSF proposal, focus areas are selected.
In the second stage, which begins this spring, projects will be
solicited from among selected focus areas. These projects will
be incorporated into a $13.5 million proposal to be submitted
to NSF on July 17.</P>

<P>Proposed focus areas include biotechnology, nanotechnology,
space technology, sustainable development/environmental sciences
and computational and information science and engineering.</P>

<P>EPSCoR aids researchers and institutions in securing federal
research and development funding to develop a state's research
infrastructure and advance economic growth. EPSCoR's goal is to
maximize the potential of a state's science and technology resources
and to use those resources as a foundation for economic growth.
New Mexico began its involvement with EPSCoR in fiscal year 2001.</P>

<P>Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories and all six of
the state's universities participate in EPSCoR.</P>

<P>EPSCoR is a joint program of the National Science Foundation
and several states and territories. The program promotes the development
of United States science and technology resources through partnerships
between federal research and development efforts, universities,
industry and government.</P>

<P>Persons or organizations interested in submitting proposals
for focus areas should contact Jim Porter of the Science and Technology
Base (STB) Program Office at 7-7824. More information about the
proposals is available at <A HREF="http://stb.lanl.gov/UC/epscor/epscor.htm">http://stb.lanl.gov/UC/epscor/epscor.htm</A>

Adams is Wednesday</FONT></B></P>

<P>In celebration of National Women's History Month, history researcher
Marilyn Adams will speak at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday in the Materials
Science Laboratory Auditorium at Technical Area 3. The Laboratory's
Women's Diversity Working Group is sponsoring the talk, which
is free and open to the public.</P>

<P>Adams' lecture, entitled &quot;A Male Minority: Men Who Stood
with Women for Equality,&quot; is a compilation of speeches and
stories about American men who braved &quot;the taunts and jeers
of the male majority to stand for fairness and justice for women.
&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The hidden history of pro-feminist men deserves to be
rescued from historical obscurity,&quot; said Adams. &quot;This
is your opportunity to become acquainted with the accounts of
how Wyoming became the first state to grant women suffrage, of
the men's role in the 1912 suffrage parade in New York and the
New Mexico Ratification of the 19th Amendment.&quot;</P>

<P>Adams has a master's degree in education from University of
California, Los Angeles. Her research focus is 19th century women.
She normally portrays Susan B. Anthony as a women's rights leader
in 1895. However she will not recreate Anthony for her lecture
at the Lab.</P>

<P>For special accommodations, contact Sheila Brandt of Occupational
Medicine (ESH-2) at 5-2667. The Women's Diversity Working Group
urges attendees to request a taxi by calling 7-8294.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Math and Science Academy Appreciation Night</FONT></B></P>

<P>Individuals and organizations who helped get the Laboratory's
new Northern New Mexico Math and Science Academy organized and
operating will be recognized at an appreciation night Thursday
evening (March 22) in Espa&ntilde;ola.</P>

<P>The Math and Science Academy Appreciation Night begins at 6
p.m. at Espa&ntilde;ola Middle School, 116 Calle Espinosa behind
Rio Valley Ford.</P>

<P>Community leaders, educators, local and state government officials,
private industry representatives and a number of individuals from
several Laboratory organizations who have contributed personnel,
equipment, furniture and office space and financial assistance
to the Math and Science Academy will be publicly recognized, said
Tony Gallegos of Environmental Dynamics and Spatial Analysis (EES-10)
and coordinator of the Math and Science Academy.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/News/080700.html#anchor4">Math
and Science Academy</A> was piloted last fall in three middle
schools in Espa&ntilde;ola, Chama and Mora. The academy is designed
to provide students with sound preparation in math, science and
technology.</P>

<P>&quot;The bottom line is the students. They're the ones who
will receive the benefits of this training, the science and math
and communication arts,&quot; Gallegos said. &quot;We want to
thank those individuals, companies and organizations that have
joined together as partners to make this happen.</P>

<P>&quot;The academy is brand new for Northern New Mexico, and
it's really directed at making systemic changes in the way students
are trained in math and the sciences. Its goal is to establish
an inquiry based curriculum in which students have hands on experience,&quot;
said Gallegos.</P>

<P>&quot;It's a modernization of teaching and seeing if we can
make students in Northern New Mexico competitive,&quot; Gallegos
continued. &quot;We're trying to get more students interested
in these areas.&quot;</P>

<P>Students and teachers in the Math and Science Academy also
will display math, science, social studies and language arts projects
they have begun while in the academy.</P>

<P>Math and Science Academy Appreciation Night also is a chance
for organizations to network and provide information about their
products or services, said Andrew Chavez of the Community Relations
(CRO) Office, which is sponsoring the event and providing refreshments
along with La Jicarita Enterprises.</P>

<P>For more information, contact Gallegos at 5-6345, or write
to <A HREF="mailto:agallegos@lanl.gov">agallegos@lanl.gov</A>
by electronic mail. Or contact Chavez at 5-4803, or <A HREF="mailto:ajchavez@lanl.gov">ajchavez@lanl.gov</A>
by electronic mail.</P>
