<h2>Experiment Summary:</h2>
Immiscible Alloy Compositions  (M557)<p>
This Skylab SL-4 experiment was the third in a series of investigations designed by Reger et al. to study the solidification of immiscible alloys under low-gravity conditions (see Reger, Apollo 14; Skylab SL-3).  The specific objective of the investigation was to determine the effects of the space environment on immiscible systems which separate during processing on Earth.
<P>
<P>During the SL-4 mission, two immiscible alloys (Au-Ge and Pb-Zn-Sb) were solidified isothermally and one immiscible alloy (Pb-Sn-In) was solidified directionally within the M-518 Multipurpose Electric Furnace.  
<P>
<P>The sample compositions and processing parameters appear to have been identical to those employed during the Skylab SL-3 experiment (see Reger, SL-3). 
<P>
<P><Note:  Reference (4) states that the Skylab SL-4 experiment "...was successfully performed from DOY [Day of Year] 355, 1900 GMT [Greenwich Mean Time] through DOY 357, 2040 GMT." (4, p. 5-60)  However, no publications that discuss the exact experiment procedure or analysis of these samples could be located at this time.>
