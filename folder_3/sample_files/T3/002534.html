      Students explore the literary elements of a Tanzanian folk tale about animals collaborating to dig a well.   Students will make connections between the message in the tale and contemporary life in Tanzania as shown through pictures on the <em>Water in Africa</em> website.  They will create original conclusions to the tale and cooperatively illustrate the folk tale using oil pastels.

<p><font size="+1" color="Teal"><a name="procedure"></a>Procedure</font><br>
  <b>Day 1 and Day 2 </b><br>
  1.  Begin by telling students that you are going to share with them  a folk tale called &quot;The Hare and the Water&quot; (<a href="Eslang02sup02.pdf" title="Adobe Acrobat File" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="Eslang02sup02.rtf" title="Rich Text File" target="_blank">RTF</a>).  Distribute the story to students and have them read it along with you.  Beginning readers can fill in words they recognize when you pause.  More fluent readers can read the story aloud to partners.   Read the story aloud again with great expression.  You may wish to assign some students the role of different characters and have them interject the lines of their characters in your narration.     
<p>



2.  Discuss the story with students with guided questions such as:

Why did the king giraffe call a meeting (what problem needed to be solved)?

How did the animals decide to solve the problem?

How did the hare act?

Did the hare's actions cause him trouble right away?

What eventually happened to the hare?

Do you think the hare learned a lesson?
<p>



3.  As the folk tale is discussed, make a storyboard of the sequence of events on butcher paper (from left to right) or on the board.  Call on students to briefly illustrate the events on the storyboard.  Provide students with copies of the Storyboard Picture Plan (<a href="Eslang02sup03.pdf" title="Adobe Acrobat File" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="Eslang02sup03.rtf" title="Rich Text File" target="_blank">RTF</a>) and have them record the events along with you.  Connect the events with arrows, and instruct the students to do the same.  An example follows:<br> 

African village is dry.<br>

King Giraffe calls animals to meet<br>

Animals dig well together.<br>

Hare lazes around.<br>

Hare sneaks water.<br>

King has Elephant guard well.<br>

Hare tricks elephant.<br>

King Giraffe is angry.<br>

Hare tricks Antelope and others.<br>

King calls Tortoise to help.<br>

Tortoise cleverly hides in well.<br>

Tortoise captures Hare.<br>

Tortoise brings Hare to King Giraffe.<br>

Hare is punished.<br>

Animals enjoy water.
<p>



 

  <b>Day 3 </b><br>

1.  Reread the folk tale to the class or have students retell the folk tale referring to the storyboard.  As the tale is reviewed, ask students to identify the main elements of the folk tale. (See the list below.)  Circle their responses and label the elements on the storyboard.  If you wish, students may also record the elements on the Folk Tale Elements (<a href="Eslang02sup01.pdf" title="Adobe Acrobat File" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="Eslang02sup01.rtf" title="Rich Text File" target="_blank">RTF</a>) handout.  For example, if students say that the one of the main characters is the giraffe, circle the word or picture of the giraffe and write "Main Character" on the storyboard.

<p>



  <b>Folk Tale Elements</b><br>

Main characters:  Hare and Tortoise, King Giraffe<br>

Secondary characters: Elephant, some students may also say  antelope<br>

Setting: Tanzania, Africa, in a dry season (refer to a map)<br>

Problem: No water<br>

Solutions: Dig a new well together<br>

Traits that aid: Animals work together and solve problem; tortoise is clever<br>

Traits that hinder: Hare is lazy and tricky, a nuisance<br> 

Conclusion: Hare is punished<br>

Outcome: The animals enjoy their clean, fresh water in peace<br>

Lesson: By working together, a village can have enough water for all, but don't expect something (water) for nothing (not helping).
<p>



2.  Next, ask students to wonder about what happens to the hare.  As a class, brainstorm some ideas for new conclusions and outcomes for the folk tale. There is no one right answer, but remind students that the endings should be a good fit with the rest of the folk tale.  They should also keep true to the message that the folk tale delivers: that by working together, problems can be solved.
<p>



3.  Ask students to generate some possible conclusions and outcomes. List on the board. Some possibilities are as follows:<br>

Conclusions:

<ul>

<li>Tortoise is rewarded.</li>

<li>Hare has a consequence.</li>

<li>Hare comes back to the village thirsty and sorry.</li>

<li>Hare returns with gift to make up for his laziness.</li>

</ul>

<p>



Outcome Scenarios

<ul>

<li>Hare is allowed back in and helps dig all future wells (he is a great burrower).</li>

<li>Hare is banished to live beyond the village and dig wells by himself.</li>

<li>Hare never learns his lesson and hops from village to village looking to sneak water.</li>

<li>Hare's trickiness is exchanged for wisdom; his laziness for work.</li>

<li>Hare must serve others from the well in order to share the water.</li>

</ul>

<p>



4.  Instruct students to write up a two or three sentence conclusion.  Try out their suggestions by placing the conclusion and outcome before or after the last sentence in the story.
<p>  



 

  <b>Day 4 </b><br>

1.  Make arrangements to use the computer lab or computer projection equipment so you can introduce your students to the <em>Water in Africa</em> website.
<p>



2.  Let students get familiar with the <em>Water in Africa</em> site.  Then direct them to the Tanzania pictures and stories or direct the class to certain passages within the resources from that country.  Ask groups of students to find and share examples of how the folk tale  of the hare and tortoise applies to life in Tanzanian villages shown in these images and stories.
<p>



3.  Allow students to explore other pictures on the <em>Water in Africa</em> website as well.  They will find many examples of people working together to build wells, gather water, and such.   Discuss why this would be necessary for the health and livelihood of these communities.
<p> 



  <b>Day 5 </b> 1.  Introduce students to the project they are expected to complete.  Tell them that they will have an opportunity to show that they too can make group decisions and work together to make something wonderful happen.  The final product will be a collaboratively illustrated version of the hare and tortoise folk tale.  Their goal is to visually recreate the folk tale's message&mdash;-through cooperation, a village may get access to water, but those who do not cooperate cannot expect to benefit from the labor of others.  In keeping with this theme, students will also be assessed on how well they work together.

<p>



2.  Refer  to the storyboard and ask students to determine which key parts of the folk tale need to be illustrated.   Students may use the Storyboard Picture Plan (<a href="Eslang02sup03.pdf" title="Adobe Acrobat File" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="Eslang02sup03.rtf" title="Rich Text File" target="_blank">RTF</a>) handout to keep track of illustration assignments or this can be listed on the board.  Ask students to volunteer or assign them the responsibility for specific illustrations.  Be sure to include some illustrations of favorite alternate endings.
<p>



3.  In keeping with the folk tale theme of collaborating for water, water will be represented in many of the pictures.  To give the pictures movement and flow, have students use pastels to illustrate their pictures in a swirling style.  
<p>



4.  Refer students to Illustration Tips (<a href="Eslang02sup04.pdf" title="Adobe Acrobat File" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="Eslang02sup04.rtf" title="Rich Text File" target="_blank">RTF</a>) or share the tips with students while demonstrating the swirling style that each picture should contain.  Also show students how to zoom in on their scenes.  Explain that their illustrations will be viewed by others at a distance.  Familiarize students with the Evaluation Rubric (<a href="Eslang02sup05.pdf" title="Adobe Acrobat File" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="Eslang02sup05.rtf" title="Rich Text File" target="_blank">RTF</a>) beforehand.

<p>  



5.  Since individual students are illustrating different parts of the same story, it is important to help students determine how they are going to draw the giraffe, hare, and tortoise so that they look similar across the story.  Students should draw main characters in similar styles and colors.  Monitor students as they draw, offering tips and suggestions for keeping the illustrations connected.  Encourage students to get up and look at each other's artwork.  Occasionally have students line up their works-in-progress so they can see how their collaborative effort is coming.  Discuss and revise as necessary.
<p><font size="+1" color="Teal"><a name="assessment"></a>Assessment</font><br>
      1.  Arrange for students to display their illustrations and retell the folk tale to other classes.  Have them rehearse using their own words as a celebration of their own cooperative efforts.  The final product, including the retelling, will be evaluated according to the rubric (<a href="Eslang02sup05.pdf" title="Adobe Acrobat File" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="Eslang02sup05.rtf" title="Rich Text File" target="_blank">RTF</a>).
<p> 2.  When students visit other classes, ask them to share how they applied the lesson of working together to develop this illustrated retelling of &quot;The Hare and the Water.&quot; Also, have students share examples of how this folk tale is still relevant in some Tanzanian villages.  The following are some suggestions for the retelling of the folk tale: 
  
Line up students with their illustrations and backs to the audience.  
  
Have students turn around only as their scene unfolds.  
  
Remind students to wait to begin to speak until they have fully turned around and to hold their pictures below their chins.
<P><font size="+1" color="Teal"><a name="followup" id="followup"></a>Follow-up Activities</font><br>
      Study two  Central African folk tales featuring the hare and the tortoise.  See Additional Resources below.    
    <p>



Compare  the hare and tortoise with the trickster coyote and clever raven in Native American tales.
    <p> 



Have students write their own folk tales.  They may wish to identify a community concern and pose a solution to it in an original tale.  See Additional Resources below.
    <P><font size="+1" color="Teal">Additional Resources</font><BR>
	  Two  companion folk tales can be found in <em>The Magic Drum: Tales from Central Africa</em>, by W. F. P. Burton.  London: Methuen and Company, 1961.

          Michelle Abernathy-Tabor is a sixth-grade teacher in Western Washington.  She enjoys teaching at the middle school level because students at this age are full of energy for life and are interested in the world around them.  She commented on this lesson after she piloted it with her students:
    <p> "My students did a final presentation, sharing their pictures and accompanying text with another class. We included the alternate endings and had our audience vote on their favorite.  Students liked the one where the hare is banned and has to dig its own burrows to look for water by itself since it did not help.  They thought that if the hare were allowed to stay and use the water it would wind up causing trouble again somehow." <br>
