<HR NOSHADE>
</DIV>

<P>Before the war, there were many latte groups and other archeoelogical
sites on Guam &#151; H. G. Hornbostel estimated "more than 27 monument
sites on the island" (Thompson, 1932, p. 15). The first of the
accompanying maps, with distribution of latte as of 25 years or so ago
shown by nachure, is from among Hornbostel's notes at the Bishop Museum
in Honolulu. The areas of "dense latte" at Mt. Santa Rosa and north of
Yigo are questionable, and none is shown for the northeastern coast; but
however undependable some of its details, the map supports the general
effect of pre-war abundance of archeology on the island. Right after the
war, Douglas Osborne located and investigated 26 sites, which are
indicated on Map 2, taken from Osborne's unpublished report of 1947.
Several of these have since disappeared, or deteriorated further to a
marked extent. A few additional sites not recorded by Osborne were also
visited in 1952; there undoubtedly are quite a number of surviving latte
groups which nave not been surveyed by either Osborne or myself, and
considerable further work is needed to complete the archeological survey
of Guam.</P>

<P><B>1. <U>Vicinity of Agana</U>.</B></P>

<P>Most of the latte sites which formerly existed in the general
vicinity of the capital were already gone at the time of Osborne's work
six years ago. Since then, others of which at least remnants survived in
1946 nave disappeared &#151; Maina site described by Osborne has given
way before a small reservoir, and the new church which was to be built
on the site at Toto is now there, with no traces of the latte
remaining.</P>

<P>There is, however, one fairly good site, in the Agana Heights area
&#151; evidently not the "badly destroyed remnants of a rather large
group" mentioned by Osborne, which seems to be completely gone &#151; on
private property across the road from Commissioner Anselmo Garrido's
house, little over a mile south of the Tutujan road. On the Tenorio
property there is an east-west group of 5 pairs of latte (9 of the 10
halege still-standing, 6 tazas present, fallen and broken), 10 feet
apart; each slab about 30" wide, 15" thick; 10" to 12' by 8" at the top;
36"-40" high. There are a few surface sherds, and it looks as if there
should be so midden deposit. On the Ullca property, just to the vest,
there is a broken-up group with one halege (vertical slab) still
standing in a distinct row of six; the opposite row, and three more
houses in an east-west are indicated only by remnants. In addition, a
few scattered latte stones and a bedrock mortar are found across the
street to the south, in the back yard of the first house east of
Commissioner Anselmo's. If at all possible, at least the first of these
groups, located right in the outskirts of town, should be acquired and
preserved for study and interpretive development.</P>

<P><B>2. <U>Maimai</U></B></P>

<P>On the F. N. Santos property at this locality, three miles southeast
of Agana, is a site probably typical of those which formerly existed,
and of those which remain to be found (the Maimai site is listed by
neither Thompson nor Osborne), in the central inland portion of the
island. It is in tangantanga and other dense growth near very large
bamboo thickets among rolling hills. There is an extensive occupation
area of black soil and widely scattered potsherds and little shells,
with no very deep midden indicated at any, one spot, and at least four
sets of latte: (1) disturbed, small, four pairs, east-west, only
standing about 24" high, 10 feet apart each way, all heads fallen, very
small; (2) three very small pairs, northeast-southwest, standing 20"
high, 24" wide at the ground, 8" thick, 10 feet apart, heads fallen,
very small, decayed and broken, not measurable; (3) four pairs, larger,
about 10 feet apart, in very bad shape; (4) five pairs, on up the hill
in very dense growth, 12 to 15 feet apart, the stones larger than in the
first two sets. Very probably this area would repay excavation, but no
special effort for preservation or interpretive development is
indicated. There probably are other similar sites still in existence but
not yet recorded in this general area of the interior, in the central
"waist" of the island.</P>

<P><B>3. <U>Tumon Bay</U></B></P>

<P>Except for the important Gongna Cove site, discussed separately
below, the formerly rich archeology of Tumon Bay had by 1945 been
destroyed by road construction and recreational development along the
beach, as reported by Osborne and by J. W. Brewer, Jr., of the National
Park Service. About 20 years before, the Tumon-Epau zone (not Epau or
Ypao Point so much as the central section of the bay) was one of the
richest areas investigated by Hornbostel (Thompson, 1932, pp. 8-11).</P>

<P><B>4. <U>Gongna</U></B></P>

<P>A large site, of a dozen groups of latte, in Gongna Cove at the north
end of Tumon Bay, not separately recorded by Hornbostel, was
investigated in 1946 by Osborne and Lt. E. S. Carpenter, U.S.M.C., who
made test excavations, collected artifacts and potsherds, and restored
the stone columns, as described in detail in Osborne's report, and
briefly in his published note of 1947. The site is now completely
overgrown by jungle, but easily found and in fair condition. As
discussed below, it should be preserved and developed.</P>

<P><B>5. <U>Hilaan Point</U></B></P>

<P>The site on the beach below (just north of) Hilaan Point, not
specifically mentioned by Mrs. Thompson in her report based on
Hornbostel's work, is described by Osborne. It is in the bush south of
the NCS beach, close to an old truck trail. There is a single set of
five pairs (one pair overthrown and disturbed in the edge of the trail)
of rough slab verticals, the heads (all fallen) neat hemispherical
unmodified brain corals about 30" in diameter and 18" thick. The latte
are aligned approximately northeast-southwest, roughly parallel with the
coast, the rows 8'8" apart and the slabs in each row 9 feet apart. The
typical halege is about 36" high; 28" wide at ground level, 24" halfway
up, and 10" at the top. There are potsherds and shells about, evidences
of occupation to the southwest, and remnants of another latte group
&#151; two fallen slabs and one good taza; there is another scattered
one, several pieces, up against the cliff base among papaya and coconut
trees at an old farm, the Guillermo Flores place; remnants of still
others are scattered by former house and farm sites and old roads.
Potsherds are found widely over this entire area. No special measures
are recommended for this site, which certainly would repay
excavation.</P>

<P><B>6. <U>Haputo Point</U></B></P>

<P>The large site which Osborne describes, and compares to Gongna, with
five groups of latte and midden 16" deep, I did not succeed in finding.
There are many scattered potsherds on the lowest slope of Haputo Point
and the beaches below, and a small rock-shelter on the end of the point
with deep midden &#151; sherds and shells in black soil &#151; in a
small area of the slope beside it, and a similar concentrated little
midden deposit in front of a large rock halfway around the cove just to
the north and about 100 yards in. There obviously must have been
considerable aboriginal occupation of the entire vicinity of Haputo
Point.</P>

<P><B>7. <U>Pugua</U></B></P>

<P>A small site on the beach below (cove just north of) Pugua Point was
noted by Hornbostel and by Osborne; I did not visit this locality. There
is no reason for it to have been disturbed since 1946.</P>

<P><B>8. <U>Uruno Point</U></B></P>

<P>The distinctive latte group which Hornbostel (see Thompson, 1932, pp.
11-13) and Osborne describe as the Oruno site, with flat thin wide
halege over five feet tall and with large narrow oval tazas with
hollowed-out slots, evidently is not at Uruno Point but some distance
south; I did not find it. It sounds particularly interesting, with its
unusual latte, Hornbostel reports burials and artifacts, similar to
those of Epau (Tumon Bay), from excavations there.</P>

<P>In the immediate vicinity of Uruno Point, and all the way north from
there to Ritidian Point, occasional potsherds are found and a continuous
occupation area is suggested, but only one latte site was found &#151;
about one mile north of Uruno Point, a short distance south of a fishing
and farming camp &#151; remnants of two groups of latte disturbed by
trees which have grown up among them and by the rooting of pigs. There
are comparatively few potsherds here, but black soil all around,
extensive shallow midden. There are five pairs of halege in each set,
mostly broken or overthrown; the tazas are missing or scattered. both
sets of latte not quite in line with each other, the south group being
"jogged" slightly inland (east), in the first (north) group, the halege
are irregular, flattish, rough slabs around 27" high, 18" wide
(narrowing to 10" at the top), and 8" thick, the rows 8'6" apart and the
stones in each row 9 feet apart. The second group consists of similar
slabs at somewhat smaller distances, 32" high, 28" wide narrowing to
14", and averaging 8" thick.</P>

<P><B>9. <U>The North Coast Ritidian Point to Tagua Point</U></B></P>

<P>No latte were found in the vicinity of the Casa Real or along the
coast to the southwest of Ritidian Point. Potsherds were found along the
base of the cliff, where there are little rock-shelters, and one small
cave containing no archeological remains, as well as along the strand.
Osborne speaks of "several small latte groups in a poor state of
preservation" in this vicinity; they probably are on around to the east.
Dr. A. H. Bryan, Jr., says that one of the chief areas of latte sites
found by Hornbostel "was on both sides of Ritidian Point, from Uruno
Point to east of Tarague Bay" ("Notes on the ancient culture of Guam.
The latte sites," <U>Guam Recorder</U> XIV, 1937. Mrs. Thompson's
monograph simply mentions Ritidian and Rinepsan among monument sites, p.
15).</P>

<P>Caves at both Ritidian Point and Rinepsan Point are mentioned by
Thompson; the former is described in a manuscript of Hornbostel's at the
Bishop Museum ("Notes on the cave at Ritidian Point, Guam" &#151;
skeletal remains, potsherds, stone implements, charcoal, etc., scattered
in confusion), and the Rinepsan cave, with a few stick-figure
pictographs, by Osborne. Drawings were also found in a cave at Mergagan
Point (Thompson, 1932, p. 20).</P>

<P>A group of exceptionally large latte at Rinepsan is also described by
Osborne. I was not able to visit the Rinepsan locality. On the one visit
made to the beautiful Tarague Beach area, the only locality on the north
coast east of Ritidian Point visited in January-February 1952, no latte
were observed. Any sites there are likely to be disturbed unless the Air
Force exercises care in road construction and recreational
development.</P>

<P><B>10. <U>The Northeast Corner of the Island</U></B></P>

<P>No archeological sites are recorded by either Hornbostel or Osborne
from Tarague Beach to Pati Point on the east end of the north coast, or
from Pati Point south through the Anao vicinity straight east of Mt.
Santa Rosa, and I did not enter any of this sector. The cliff descends
abruptly to the sea with no beaches along here. Sites are nevertheless
to be expected, although it is one of the few parts of the coast left
unmarked on the map herein reproduced as Figure 1, and the area should
be surveyed.</P>

<P><B>11. <U>Janum</U></B></P>

<P>At the Janum locality, on the east coast near Catalina Point and just
east (northeast) of Sagua Bay, evidences of intensive occupation &#151;
basalt mortars, slingstones, bones, abundant potsherds &#151; were noted
by Osborne; the locality is not mentioned by Mrs. Thompson and evidently
was not investigated by Hornbostel.</P>

<P>Two sets of latte were found near the Taitano place at Janum, about
or over 100 yards apart. One is of six and the other of eight
medium-sized halege, about 30" tall, mostly standing but the caps mostly
disappeared. Nearby, on the Taitano farm, there are several stone
(basalt boulder) mortars, a few pebble pestles, and an abundance of
potsherds.</P>

<P><B>12. <U>Pagat Point</U></B></P>

<P>Here, also not previously recorded, is an extensive and important
site, much disturbed by natural forces but still interesting and
promising. At least some of the latte were standing up to about 10 years
ago in good condition. There is now an extensive group of scattered
fallen columns, with two stones standing in each of two rows and other
sets evident. There were at least three distinct latte groups, Slabs
(halege) now standing run 30" to 36" high, 8" to 10" thick and 18" wide
at the top, about 24" by 14" at maximum width and thickness. The fallen
stones strewn about include similar slabs; very rough, more or less,
hemispherical, tazas, about 30" high by 60" diameter; and miscellaneous
big rocks. There are two basaltic boulder mortars, and an abundance of
potsherds, midden deposit over a foot deep. The entire site is about 200
feet along the coast by 75 feet from the strand to a rock point standing
just inland. The site is in dense growth, with many pu-ting and chopag
trees, just above the narrow beach. Pagat Point is reached from a trail
which goes down the cliff southeast of the Marbo Poste, exchange and the
Air Force housing area. Ownership was not determined, but there is no
modern occupation of this section of the coast by Guamanians.</P>

<P><B>13. <U>The Northern Interior</U></B></P>

<P>Very few archeological sites are on record or to be expected on the
plateau of the northern half of Guam, in spite of the abundance of
remains all around the coast below the cliffs. Any that formerly
existed, furthermore, are likely to have been destroyed by airfields and
other modern construction except in the central part, where there seems
to have been no occupation at all, prehistoric or modern.</P>

<P>Two interior sites are described by Osborne, only one with latte, at
Mogfog &#151; this group apparently has been removed since 1945 by
military construction, as none could be found in the vicinity of Mogfog
and around where oldtimers stated the latte to be. Osborne also refers
to evidences of prehistoric occupation east of Yigo (no latte) and
scattered potsherds throughout the vicinity. A large former latte site
at Dededo had already been destroyed in 1946 by airfield
construction.</P>

<P><B>14. <U>Pago</U></B></P>

<P>The former settlement of Pago, occupied 1681-1857, on the northwest
side of Pago Bay, in cultivated fields on the Perez property, is marked
by abundant potsherds, including much Chinese and/or Japanese porcelain
as well as the locally made coarse thick brown Marianas Plainware, but
no latte or other visible remains of structures. Investigation of this
site would be a particularly interesting study.</P>

<P><B>15. <U>Yona and Pulantat</U></B></P>

<P>The marine encampment close to Yona cleared away a number of latte;
remnants of at least two groups were seen in February 1952, about 1/4
mile northwest of the village. The large Madog site near Pulantat is
reported to be still there undamaged; it was described by Osborne in his
1947 published paper as follows: "In a dense tongue of jungle above
Pulantat, near the radio station, is one of the most spectacular sites
on Guam. It has not been previously mentioned * * * One of the several
latte groups is in an excellent state of preservation. The supports are
well shaped and smoothed, and the caps approach the type previously
recorded for Fena (Laura Thompson, 1932,p. 14). Another set has the most
massive supports yet seen on Guam. The single standing stone is nearly
7-1/2' high and 3-1/2' in diameter. With the cap in place it must have
been 10-1/2 or 11 feet * * * many smaller contiguous latte. Unusual and
asymmetrical shapes and sizes are common. All of these are buried in
nearly impenetrable jungle and <U>limonchina</U> thickets. * * * Other
smaller sites exist nearby." (<U>American Anthropologist</U> 49-3, p.
522). Additional detail is given in Osborne's manuscript report. I did
not visit this important site.</P>

<P><B>16. <U>The Ylig-Togcha Sector</U></B></P>

<P>A latte site in the Ylig vicinity is mentioned by Thompson (1932) and
described by Osborne, and a similar one in the Togcha vicinity is
mentioned by Osborne. Neither was found in 1952, but they may well still
exist. This area of the east coast, between Talafofo Bay and the
Yona-Pago Bay area, looks promising and has never been intensively
surveyed; it would repay investigation, along the coast itself and up
the little streams and the entire Ylig River drainage, which should
contain latte sites comparable to those of the Fena River basin. There
are remnants of at least two destroyed latte sites in farms alongside
the road about halfway between Togcha Bay and Camp Dealey.</P>

<P><B>17. <U>Talafofo Vicinity</U></B></P>

<P>The other 50% of the Talafofo River site at Asoiroga has disappeared
since Osborne's brief description of it as half destroyed by the road
(Highway 4) in 1946. Potsherds were collected below the hill by M/Sgt.
A. L. Aitken, USAF, in the last few years. No archeological site appears
to survive in the immediate vicinity of the town of Talafofo. There seem
to be no pictographs in the Talafofo caves; those referred to by Mrs.
Thompson and others (e. g., Lt. F. A. Stephenson, "Talafofo cave
writing," <U>Guam Recorder</U> XIII, 1936) must either be intended for
Inarajan (see No. 19 below) or else are imaginary interpretations of
natural streakings or else have been covered by dripstone and lime
incrustations &#151; which would have long since concealed any very
ancient pictographs in at least the smaller caves here and in much of
the largest one.</P>

<P><B>18. <U>Dandan</U></B></P>

<P>At this locality, a mile north. of Malojlo and hallway between
Talafofo and Inarajan, just west of (inland from) the highway, there is
an extensive occupation site with two groups of latte and scattered
remnants of others, on the farm of Mr. Jose San Nicolas and in the
Martinez pasture. These are large stones, 3-1/2 to 4 feet high but very
thick, in groups oriented roughly NW-SE and NE-SW. Potsherds are
abundant. No sites around Malojlo are mentioned in Thompson, 1932, but
Hornbostel is said to have dug here and found human bones. Other sites
are reported in the general vicinity and north toward Talafofo.</P>

<P><B>19.<U>Inarajan and the South Coast</U></B></P>

<P>The cave on the north side of Inarajan say in which there are several
rather small stick-figure pictographs in white is a little wave cut
cleft just above the water, with no floor; I do not see how it could
have contained potsherds and broken stone implements (Thompson, 1932, p.
20) of any considerable antiquity or in any quantity.</P>

<P>No latte have been reported in the vicinity of Inarajan, or anywhere
along the southeast coast, from Malojlo (two miles north of Inarajan)
around to Merizo, but there surely must be archeological remains of
prehistoric and historic Chamorro occupation in this area. A find of
potsherds at a depth of 13 feet on the Merizo-Umatac road near the
Toguan River in 1926 is reported (Thompson, 1932, p. 31). Many shell
gorges and fishhooks have been found on Cocos Island.</P>

<P>Latte sites just inland from Merizo and extending up as far,
apparently, as Jalaoian have been heard of but not visited. There is
none surviving or known to nave existed at Merizo or close to the coast
in the vicinity, or on up the southwest coast past Umatac and Ceti Bay
to Facpi Point. A small site with a few latte stones is reported on
Facpi Point by M/Sgt. A. L. Aitken, USAF.</P>

<P>Potsherds are common along the strand at Umatac, Ceti Bay (as
mentioned by Osborne, ms.), and Seja Bay, but there seem to be no latte
whatever. No sites in this part of Guam are mentioned by Mrs. Thompson.
Osborne, however, found one good taza near the beach at Ceti Bay, and
thinks there may have been a latte group there; he collected a
particularly interesting range of potsherds here.</P>

<P><B>20. <U>inland from Umatac</U></B></P>

<P>A partly overthrown latte group on the right side of the road on a
hillside about two miles from Umatac toward Mt. Lamlam and Agat is
mentioned by Osborne (1947, p. 522, and ms. report). No sites in this
vicinity are mentioned by Mrs. Thompson; but this one is said locally to
have been dug into by collectors for items to sell to Hornbostel in the
1920's. it has not been noticeably disturbed further since 1946. Three
slabs in one row are still in place; heaped at one end of the set are
three more halege and a half-dozen capstones, at the other end are two
more tazas. No potsherds were found here (Osborne collected
several).</P>

<P>There is another set of latte just off the Umatac road, below it on
the north on a slope, a few hundred yards southwest of the first site
above: five pairs of good heavy 3-1/2-foot vertical columns, spaced 12
feet apart in two rows 15 feet apart, all heads present but all fallen
and some broken.</P>

<P>Several other latte sites are known to exist inland from Umatac;
mainly in the Sologna Valley, at locations within view from the first
Umatac Road site &#151; one well up in the valley and almost clear
across it, at N. 70&deg; E. from the Umatac Road site, one down and to
the close to a little knoll 35&deg; S. of E. from the Umatac Road site.
Another, the Pajon or Pajung Valley site, is across the Sologna Valley
the east, and beyond it is reported the Fanji site, a group of 12
columns 3-1/2 feet high "standing in a square" (presumably 6 pairs in 2
rows), according to Mr. Joe Quinata of Umatac.</P>

<P><B>21. <U>The Talafofo River Basin</U></B></P>

<P>Only in the comparatively extensive drainage of the Talafofo River
have latte sites been recorded in any number in the interior of Guam
(Thompson, 1932; H. G. Hornbostel, "Notes on inland latte," ms. at
Bishop Museum; Osborne, 1947, and ma.). Several of importance have been
separately described:</P>

<P><U>Acapulco</U> (Osborne, ms.) &#151; a large site on a tributary
stream safely below the Fena dam, believed to survive undamaged (not
visited in 1952).</P>

<P><U>Fena</U> (Thompson, 1932, pp. 14-15; Osborne, ms.) &#151; has been
destroyed, and entirely submerged by the Fena Reservoir.</P>

<P><U>Mepo</U> (Thompson, 1932, p. 14; Osborne, ms.) &#151; removed in
the construction of the entrance spur for Magazine 173 in the Naval
Ammunition Depot, the very large stones heaped on either side of the
entrance. </P>

<P><U>Chandija</U> (Osborne, ms.) &#151; an important site, largely
destroyed by a NAD road.</P>

<P><U>Bona</U> (Osborne, ms.) &#151; a small site, evidently has
disappeared except for the stones which have been set up near the NAD
entrance.</P>

<P><U>San Isidro</U> (Osborne, ms.) &#151; could not be located, and may
have been removed in the course of NAD construction.</P>

<P>Other sites have been reported to exist in the basin, and those
downstream from Fena toward Talafofo presumably survive. Very possibly
there are important sites to be found along the Ugum River, major
tributary from the south. There seems to be none on the grassy uplands
on the north of the Fena basin crossed by the Santa Rita-Talafofo
road.</P>
