                      Subpart A--General Provisions

Sec. <strong>886</strong>.1  Scope.

    (a) This part sets forth the classification of ophthalmic devices 
intended for human use that are in commercial distribution.
    (b) The identification of a device in a regulation in this part is 
not a precise description of every device that is, or will be, subject 
to the regulation. A manufacturer who submits a premarket notification 
submission for a device under part 807 cannot show merely that the 
device is accurately described by the section title and identification 
provision of a regulation in this part but shall state why the device is 
substantially equivalent to other devices, as required by Sec. 807.87.
    (c) To avoid duplicative listings, an ophthalmic device that has two 
or more types of uses (e.g., used both as a diagnostic device and as a 
therapeutic device) is listed in one subpart only.
    (d) References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of 
Federal Regulations are to chapter I of title 21 unless otherwise noted.

Sec. <strong>886</strong>.3  Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.

    A device included in this part that is classified into class III 
(premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the 
date shown in the regulation classifying the device unless the 
manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an 
exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An 
approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an 
order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the 
device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for 
the device.
    (a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed 
before the enactment date of the amendments, or

[[Page 409]]

a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, 
has an approval under section 515 of the act, FDA must promulgate a 
regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, 
except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Such a 
regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during 
the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the 
last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that 
classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. 
See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective 
date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the 
regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the 
device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an 
order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If 
FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring 
premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies 
to the device.
    (b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into 
commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device 
formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by 
statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace 
period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring 
completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially 
distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being 
commercially distributed may be a ``new'' device as defined in this 
section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify 
the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new 
use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that 
as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device 
must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial 
distribution.
    (c) A device identified in a regulation in this part that is 
classified into class III and that is subject to the transitional 
provisions of section 520(1) of the act is automatically classified by 
statute into class III and must have an approval under section 515 of 
the act before being commercially distributed. Accordingly, the 
regulation for such a class III transitional device states that as of 
the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have 
an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

Sec. <strong>886</strong>.9  Limitations of exemptions from section 510(k) of the act.

    FDA's decision to grant an exemption from the requirement of 
premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of 
class I device is based upon the existing and reasonably foreseeable 
characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic 
type. Because FDA cannot anticipate every change in intended use or 
characteristic that could significantly affect a device's safety or 
effectiveness, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I 
device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of 
premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA 
before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate 
commerce for commercial distribution the device when:
    (a) The device is intended for a use different from its intended use 
before May 28, 1976, or the device is intended for a use different from 
the intended use of a preamendments device to which it had been 
determined to be substantially equivalent; e.g., the device is intended 
for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use 
where the former intended use was by health care professionals only; or
    (b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental 
scientific technology than that in use in the device before May 28, 
1976; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather 
than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device 
detects or identifies infectious agents by using a deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture 
or immunoassay technology.
