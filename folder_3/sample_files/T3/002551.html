    <B>November 5, 1998</B>: <FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>huttle Discovery
    is carrying two telescopes, SOLCON and SPARTAN, designed to unravel
    two of the most perplexing mysteries in science. One mystery
    concerns the temperature of the Earth: Did the Sun cause a &quot;Little
    Ice Age&quot; two hundred years ago? A second conundrum involves
    the temperature of the Sun: Why is the solar corona, the outermost
    layer of the sun's atmosphere, 2,000 times hotter than the sun's
    surface? The STS-95 mission may not solve these longstanding
    puzzles, but scientists hope to uncover some important clues.</TD>

    <H3>Mystery the First: the Solar Constant</H3>

    <P>In the late 17th century there was a 70 year period called
    the Maunder Minimum when no sunspots were observed on the Sun.
    The normal 11-yr sunspot cycle essentially stopped, and solar
    activity was abnormally low. At the same time Northern Europe
    experienced the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot;, a series of bitter
    winters lasting 50 years. There was another decrease in sunspot
    activity between 1800 and 1830. It wasn't as severe as the Maunder
    Minimum, but temperatures in Europe and America took another
    dip. The year 1816 is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Year
    without a Summer&quot; because of unusually cold weather. Many
    of the novels of Charles Dickens, which depict harsh winters
    in London, were set in this period. <BR>
<BR>
    Today, scientists are wondering if there is a connection. Does
    solar activity influence Earth's climate, and just how constant
    is the sun, anyway? Today the sun deposits 1370 Watts of power
    on every square meter of the Earth's upper atmosphere. That number
    is called the solar constant. Since the early 1980's orbiting
    spacecraft have been keeping an eye on the Sun to monitor possible
    changes the solar constant. The Solar Maximum Mission, which
    flew from 1980 until 1989 established that the sun's radiance
    does fluctuate by a small amount. &quot;It [the solar radiance]
    is 0.1% less during the sunspot minimum than during solar maximum&quot;,
    according to Dr. David Hathaway, a solar physicist at the NASA
    MSFC Space Sciences Lab. &quot;These small changes are probably
    not enough to affect climate here on Earth, but what we really
    want to know is this: are there larger changes that take place
    on time scales of 100 years or more? If there are, then there
    could be a connection between the Sun and the Little Ice Age.
    Right now we just don't know.&quot;</TD>

    An instrument called SOLCON has been sent aloft on STS-95 to
    help answer this question. SOLCON is a radiometer, a device used
    to measure the total power radiated by the sun at all wavelengths.
    Its measurements will be used to calibrate instruments on satellites
    that are continuously monitoring the sun's output. &quot;One
    problem with instruments in orbit is that they tend to be good
    at measuring small changes in the solar radiance, but not so
    good at measuring its absolute value,&quot; continued Hathaway.
    &quot;Calibration is very important.&quot;</TD>

    the variability of the sun on 100-yr time scales takes time,
    and SOLCON is a crucial component of the process. With enough
    measurements by SOLCON and other satellites scientists are hopeful
    that they can answer some of the outstanding questions about
    climate change here on Earth.</TD>

    SPARTAN Scientist Dr. Richard Fisher noted that investigators

    The main target of SPARTAN's observations was the solar corona.
    Astronomers believe something odd is happening there. Here on
    Earth as you move from sea level to higher altitude the air generally
    becomes colder, but the Sun works in reverse. Its outermost layer,
    the corona, is hotter than 1,000,000 degrees C while the visible
    surface, or photosphere, has a temperature of only about 6,000
    degrees C. How the corona is heated is one of the great mysteries
    of solar physics.</TD>

</TABLE><BR>
<TABLE WIDTH="600" CELLPADDING="5" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2">

    <TD>
    <P>&quot;It should be possible to heat the corona with waves,&quot;
    says Dr. John Davis at the NASA/MSFC Space Sciences Lab. &quot;All
    kinds of waves are generated in the photosphere - such as acoustic
    waves, from mechanical motions, or Alfven waves, from shaking
    magnetic fields. These waves spread upward into the corona which
    absorbs energy from the waves. <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;The trouble with this idea is that none of the waves likes
    to be absorbed by the corona. They either go right through, or
    are reflected back to their starting point. This is a long-standing
    problem and nobody has a good solution for it. <BR>
<BR>
    Alternatively, scientists from Marshall have suggested that energy
    is pumped into the corona through a series of little explosive
    effects - microflares - that occur all over the place.&quot;</P>

<BR>
    There are lots of theories, but no one knows the answer. The
    corona is hard to study from Earth because its light is relatively
    dim compared to the blindingly bright disk of the sun. The white
    light corona can be viewed from Earth only during a solar eclipse
    or with a special instrument called a coronagraph. Ground-based
    astronomers are never able to see the corona's ultraviolet radiation
    because Earth's atmosphere blocks UV rays.</TD>

    <P>SPARTAN is equipped with two telescopes that can measure both
    white light and UV emissions from the sun's corona. <BR>
<BR>
    The white light coronagraph, developed by the High-Altitude Observatory
    in Boulder, Colo., will measure the density of the electrons
    in the coronal white light. The ultraviolet coronal spectrometer
    from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Harvard will
    measure the velocities, temperatures, and densities of the coronal
    gases.</P>

    <P>By comparing the data collected by the two telescopes and
    combining the observations of the SPARTAN 201 missions and Ulysses
    and observations made by ground-based instruments, scientists
    expect to gain a much more complete picture of the solar corona
    and some insight into what might be heating it. <BR>
<BR>
    SPARTAN 201-05 observations this week were coordinated with observations
    made from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite.
    The second and third missions were coordinated with the passage
    of the Ulysses spacecraft over the sun's south and north poles.</TD>
