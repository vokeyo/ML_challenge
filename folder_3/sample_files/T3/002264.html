</H1>
Protons and neutrons stick together in atomic nuclei through the <I>strong
force</I>, much stronger than electromagnetism but only transmitted over a very
short range. There are very many other strongly interacting particles, with
names such as pions (<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ \pi$">) and kaons, all called <I>hadrons</I>. In the early 1960's it
was realized that the hadrons are not fundamental, but are composed of much
smaller (and perhaps really fundamental, like electrons) particles that were
called <I>quarks</I> by Murray Gell-Mann, originator of the idea with George
Zweig. All of the 100 or so hadrons known at the time could be ``explained" as
being made out of only three different types of quark (<IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$ q$">), called up (<IMG

and strange (<IMG

 ALT="$ s$">) and their anti-particles (<IMG

 $\bar{u},\bar{d}$
 -->
<IMG

 ALT="$ \bar{u},\bar{d}$"> and
<IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.png"
 ALT="$ \bar{s}$">. Quarks and antiquarks are somewhat like electrons and their
antiparticles, positrons, except that they interact with the strong force and
their electric charge is not -1 and +1 but <!-- MATH
 $+\frac{2}{3}, -\frac{1}{3},
-\frac{1}{3}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.png"
 ALT="$ +\frac{2}{3}, -\frac{1}{3},
-\frac{1}{3}$"> for quarks, the opposite for antiquarks. Using these quarks and
antiquarks, one could build up all known hadrons with a simple rule: put
together three quarks [<IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.png"
 ALT="$ qqq$">] (protons and neutrons are like that) or three
antiquarks [<!-- MATH
 $\bar{q}\bar{q}\bar{q}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$ \bar{q}\bar{q}\bar{q}$">] (making antiprotons and antineutrons and
others) or a quark and an antiquark [<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.png"
 ALT="$ q\bar{q}$">] (pions and kaons are like
that). This scheme was taken very seriously when a particle it predicted, made
of three strange quarks, <IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.png"
 ALT="$ \Omega^-$"> [<IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.png"
 ALT="$ sss$">], was found at Brookhaven in 1964.
But what was the reason for that rule? A result of the rule is that hadrons have
only integer electric charges, <!-- MATH
 $Q = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img15.png"
 ALT="$ Q = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2$">.

<P>
As we have seen, electric charges can be positive or negative: the charge <IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img16.png"
 ALT="$ Q$"> on the 
electron is <IMG
 WIDTH="94" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img17.png"
 ALT="$ Q(e)=-1$"> (the -ve sign is purely conventional) and that on the
positron is <!-- MATH
 $Q(\bar{e}) = +1$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="94" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img18.png"
 ALT="$ Q(\bar{e}) = +1$">. The rule is <I>``Like charges repel, unlike
charges attract"</I>, so the <IMG
 WIDTH="95" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img19.png"
 ALT="$ Q(p) = +1$"> proton electrically attracts a negative
electron and they thus combine to make a neutral hydrogen atom. Neutral
atoms are made out of equal-in-magnitude but opposite-in-sign electric charges.
The strong force also has an associated charge,
different in interesting ways from the electric charge. This charge can have three distinct values,
each with its own ``antivalue". You have to put all three together for them to
cancel out and make neutral, or (strong) chargeless. Or you can put one of these
charges together with its anticharge and they cancel and make neutral. Now we
can state our puzzling rule as: <I>``All hadrons have no strong charge"</I>; they
are neutral as far as the strong force is concerned. Actually although the
strong charges of the quarks cancel inside hadrons (protons, neutrons, ...) they
can still stick together through a residual weaker remnant of the force, just as
electrically neutral atoms stick together to make solids and liquids. 

<P>
The idea of the three strong charges combining to make neutral reminded
physicists of how shining three colored lights, <I>Red, Blue, and Green</I> on a
surface makes white light. (The fact that three colors are needed is more
biology than physics; it is because we humans have three color receptors in our
eyes!) So these strong quark charges were labelled
<!-- MATH
 $R,G,B,\bar{R},\bar{G},\bar{B}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.png"
 ALT="$ R,G,B,\bar{R},\bar{G},\bar{B}$"> and the new theory of the strong interaction
acquired the name <I>Quantum Chromodynamics</I>, QCD, in the tradition of the theory
of electromagnetic interactions <I>Quantum Electrodynamics</I>. (Of course this colorful
vocabulary has nothing to do with the real colors of light, we just borrowed the names.)
Any particular quark is constantly changing its ``color" between <IMG
 WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.png"
 ALT="$ R, G$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="$ B$"> by emitting
and receiving force particles (<I>``gluons"</I> which carry a color and an anticolor,
such as <IMG
 WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img23.png"
 ALT="$ R\bar{G}$">. Another contrast
between the theories is that the electric force between two charges gets weaker
as they separate, while the strong force between two strong quark charges gets
stronger as they separate. The 2004 Nobel Physics prize was given to Gross,
Politzer and Wilczek for calculating how this happens. One result is that you
can never pull a quark out of a proton. If you try, the energy you pump in just
ends up making more hadrons! No free quarks! Another result is that the strong
quark-quark force at large distances is complicated and very difficult to
calculate. Only in some limited cases can we make accurate calculations.

<P>
You may have noticed that the rules for combining quarks given above
allow other combinations. For example [<!-- MATH
 $qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="43" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img24.png"
 ALT="$ qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$">] could be
[<!-- MATH
 $R\bar{R}G\bar{G}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img25.png"
 ALT="$ R\bar{R}G\bar{G}$">] and neutral overall. Some hadrons seem to have this
composition, although such a <I>tetraquark</I> can sometimes transform itself
into (``mix with") a common [<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.png"
 ALT="$ q\bar{q}$">] hadron. Another possibility is
[<!-- MATH
 $qqqq\bar{q}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img26.png"
 ALT="$ qqqq\bar{q}$">] or <I>pentaquark</I> (from the greek for five, pente). This is like a common [<IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.png"
 ALT="$ qqq$">] and a
[<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.png"
 ALT="$ q\bar{q}$">] stuck together, but <I>deeply</I> stuck together so that they do not
fall apart for a relatively long time (long for us means about <IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$ 10^{-22}$">
seconds!). It doesn't actually have five quarks, but four quarks and an
antiquark. A deeply bound <!-- MATH
 $n[udd]K^+[u\bar{s}]$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img28.png"
 ALT="$ n[udd]K^+[u\bar{s}]$"> would have to have quark content
<!-- MATH
 $[uudd\bar{s}]$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img29.png"
 ALT="$ [uudd\bar{s}]$"> and could not be made from the old rule. Physicists looked for
such so-called ``exotic" states way back in the 1960's but none was found. On
the other hand it was never proven in Quantum Chromodynamics theory that they
could not exist; the theory is too difficult in this domain. Still, it caused a
stir in 2003 when several experiments claimed to see evidence for a <IMG
 WIDTH="46" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img30.png"
 ALT="$ nK^+$">
state. If this pentaquark state exists there should be many others. For example,
there is a hadron called the Xi-minus, <IMG
 WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img31.png"
 ALT="$ \Xi^-$"> with quark content [<IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img32.png"
 ALT="$ ssd$">]. If it
could be deeply bound with a <!-- MATH
 $\pi^-[\bar{u}d]$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img33.png"
 ALT="$ \pi^-[\bar{u}d]$">
the combination <!-- MATH
 $[ssdd\bar{u}]$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img34.png"
 ALT="$ [ssdd\bar{u}]$"> would have to be a
pentaquark. There were claims from some experiments for such a state. Finding pentaquarks would not overthrow QCD but would be a challenge to
the theorists to understand them and their properties. If they exist they
should sometimes be produced when high energy protons and antiprotons collide in
the Fermilab Tevatron, currently the highest energy particle collider on Earth.
With the Collider Detector at Fermilab, CDF, we collected about 36,000 <IMG
 WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img31.png"
 ALT="$ \Xi^-$"> events,
leaving tracks at least a few cm long. We combined these with pion <IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img35.png"
 ALT="$ \pi^-$"> tracks,
calculating the combined mass, i.e. the mass a parent particle would have if it
decayed to the <IMG
 WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img31.png"
 ALT="$ \Xi^-$"> and the <IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img35.png"
 ALT="$ \pi^-$">. The resulting mass distribution shows no tell-tale
peak where the pentaquark would be, and where the claimed observations were made. On the
other hand the neutral combination <!-- MATH
 $\Xi^-\pi^+$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="53" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img36.png"
 ALT="$ \Xi^-\pi^+$"> showed a very clear peak corresponding to  a known
hadron, <IMG
 WIDTH="71" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img37.png"
 ALT="$ \Xi(1530)$">. The experimental conditions at CDF and the other experiments are
different. It is conceivable, but seems unlikely, that these different conditions could
explain how the pentaquarks could exist but not be seen in CDF. Were the experiments that
claimed signals mistaken, or perhaps misled by some unlikely statistical fluctuations? It
is an interesting situation, and further experiments will surely clear it up. For the
present we can only say that we see no evidence for these states at the Tevatron, and we
do not know why we would not, if they exist. Whether or not they exist, it is a challenge to QCD
theorists to explain the experimental facts.
