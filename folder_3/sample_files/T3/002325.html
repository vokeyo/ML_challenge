      T.01 - How to link the UNILIB library ?
</ul> <h2> <a name="answer"> Answer </a> </h2> <ul>
      The UNILIB library is available in the form of a
      Fortran object library (unilib.lib or libunilib.a).
      To produce an executable code, the UNILIB library
      should be linked to any Fortran program (examples are included
      in the <a href=toc.htm#examples>UNILIB Table of Contents</a>).
      Note that, on several
      platforms, the UNILIB library can be linked to programs written
      in another computer language.  In the following we will
      assume that the user's programme is called
      <code>myprog.for</code> (or <code>myprog.f</code>).
      For additional information and detailed descriptions of the linker,
      the user has to refer to a documentation specific of the
      platform and operating system.
<p>                                                       
      Under the OpenVMS operating system, the library can also be linked
      to the IDL software.
</ul> <h4> MS-DOS / MS-Windows  </h4> <ul>
      The object library (v2.01) has been built with the DIGITAL Visual Fortran 
      Compiler version 5.0C on a PC/Pentium running Microsoft Windows
      NT 4.00.      
      Since the format of the LIB files does not seem to be a standard
      under the MS-DOS/MS-Windows operating system, we recommand to
      use the same compiler.
      Assuming that the files <code>unilib.lib</code> and
      <code>structure.h</code> are in the current
      directory, the user executable code can be produced by the
      command:<pre>
> DF MYPROG.F UNILIB.LIB </pre> 
</ul> <h4> OpenVMS (FORTRAN) </h4> <ul>
      The object libraries for VAX and AXP platforms
          are different. The  object libraries have been
      built with the Digital Fortran 77 compiler: the VAX library (v2.01)
      on a VAX Station 4000 running VAX/VMS V6.1, and the AXP library (v2.01)
      on a Alpha Station 600 running OpenVMS v7.1.      
      Assuming that the files <code>unilib.olb</code> and
      <code>structure.h</code> are in the current
      directory, the user executable code can be produced by the
      command:<pre>
$ FOR MYPROG.FOR
$ LINK MYPROG.OBJ, UNILIB.OLB/LIB /EXE=MYPROG.EXE
</pre></ul> <h4> OpenVMS (IDL) </h4> <ul>
      Before starting IDL, the user has to define a logical which
      includes the path to the shareable image. For further information
      see <i>VMS-Specific Abilities / Calling a VAX FORTRAN Subroutine</i>
      in Chapter 18 of the IDL user's guide.<pre>
$ DEFINE unilib MY_DISK:[MY_DIRECTORY]UNILIB.EXE
$ IDL
</pre>

</ul><h4> HP-UX  </h4> <ul>
      The object library (v2.01) has been built with the HP-UX FORTRAN 77 
      compiler on a HP 9000/879 running HP-UX release 10.20.
      Assuming that the files <code>libunilib.a</code> and
      <code>structure.h</code> are in the current
      directory, the user executable code can be produced by the
      command:<pre>
> f77 +ppu myprog.f -Wl,-L. -lunilib -o myprog.out
</pre> </ul> <h4> OSF  </h4> <ul>
      The object library (v2.01) has been built with the Digital FORTRAN 77 
      compiler on a  Alpha Workstation 3000 running Digital UNIX V3.2C.
      Assuming that the files <code>libunilib.a</code> and
      <code>structure.h</code> are in the current
      directory, the user executable code can be produced by the
      command:<pre>
> f77 myprog.f -L. -lunilib -o myprog.out
</pre></ul> <h4> SunOS  </h4> <ul>
      The object library (v2.01) has been built with the Sun FORTRAN 77 
      compiler version 4.0 on a  SPARC Station running SunOS 5.4.
      Assuming that the files <code>libunilib.a</code> and
      <code>structure.h</code> are in the current
      directory, the user executable code can be produced by the
      command:<pre>
> f77 myprog.f -L. -lunilib -o myprog.out
</pre></ul> <h4> Linux (PC)  </h4> <ul>
      The object library (v2.01) has been built with the PGI Fortran 
      compiler on a  PC/Pentium running Linux 2.2.0.
      Assuming that the files <code>libunilib.a</code> and
      <code>structure.h</code> are in the current
      directory, the user executable code can be produced by the
      command:<pre>
> pgf77 myprog.f -L. -lunilib -o myprog.out
