    only what you can find lying around your house, put together
    an experiment to test a question in science that's never been
    answered.<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="260" height="271" align="right"><tr><td><a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/soyuz-tma/html/iss006e21115.html"><img border="0" src="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/images/ingenuity/iss006e21115_med.jpg" width="260" height="271" alt="Nikolai Budarin"></a></td></tr></table><p>That's
    essentially the challenge faced by some scientists who want their
    research done onboard the International Space Station (ISS).
    With the shuttle fleet grounded and space limited on Russian
    rockets, it's not easy to send their equipment to orbit. What
    can they do?</p><p>Improvise.</p><p><strong>Right</strong>: <em>Cosmonaut Nikolai M. Budarin, Expedition Six flight
    engineer, squeezes inside a Soyuz spacecraft. Space is tight. [more at http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/soyuz-tma/html/iss006e21115.html]</em></p><p>Astronauts onboard the station are adaptable, natural experimenters,
    and they don't always need fancy equipment to do science. So
    researchers have dreamed up some clever ways to use what's already
    on hand aboard the station: maintenance tools, food supplies,
    hygiene items, cameras ... and, of course, weightlessness.</p><p>The surprisingly elegant experiments they've devised
    are a showcase of resourcefulness. Over the next few weeks, Science@NASA
    will feature a series of articles about these experiments, showing
    how ordinary items can be used for science in space.</p><p>We begin with Miscible Fluids in Microgravity, an experiment
    concocted by University of Southern Mississippi chemistry professor
    John Pojman with colleagues Vitaly Volpert and Nick Bessonov
    of the Universite Lyon I in France. They want to find
    out what happens when two miscible fluids are combined in microgravity.</p><p>"Miscible means mixable," explains Pojman. "When
    miscible fluids are combined, they merge. For instance, water
    and molasses are miscible. One diffuses completely into the other.
    Immiscible fluids are just the opposite; they remain separated
    like oil and water."</p><p>Sounds simple. But 100 years ago a Dutch physicist named Diederik
    Korteweg pointed out a complication: sometimes miscible fluids
    act like immiscible fluids.</p><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="160" height="191" align="left"><tr><td><img border="0" src="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/images/ingenuity/korteweg.gif" width="160" height="191" alt="D. Korteweg"></td></tr></table><p>Indeed,
    you can see this in your own kitchen using water and molasses.
    Fill a clear cup with water. Next, dip a spoon into a jar of
    molasses, and tip the spoon over the cup. A stream of pure syrup
    will plunge to the bottom. At first the goopy molasses seems
    to ignore the surrounding water. For a little while they seem
    to be immiscible. Eventually, though, the syrup dissolves.</p><p><strong>Left</strong>: <em>A 19th century photograph of Diederik Korteweg. [more at http://staff.science.uva.nl/%7Ejanwieg/korteweg/]</em></p><p>Korteweg was fascinated by what happens during that curious
    time just after miscible fluids are combined and just before
    they dissolve. Do they really behave like immiscible fluids?
    Korteweg knew that immiscible fluids tend to break apart into
    little droplets--a side-effect of surface tension. He calculated
    that miscible fluids should break apart in the same way during
    the early moments of gentle mixing.</p><p>Miscible fluids, gently mixed, are widely used in the plastics
    industry and they're necessary for certain types of medical research--"especially
    protein crystal growth in microgravity," notes Pojman. How
    they merge, dissolving evenly or breaking apart into droplets,
    actually makes a difference.</p><p>Yet no one knows if Korteweg was right. "It's impossible
    to test his theory on Earth because gravity overwhelms surface
    tension," says Pojman. Fluid streams fall apart because
    of their own weight. "We need to do this experiment in space."</p><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="194" height="130" align="right"><tr><td><a href="dribble_short.mov"><img border="0" src="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/images/ingenuity/dribble_short.gif" width="194" height="130" alt="see caption"></a></td></tr></table><p><strong>Right</strong>: <em>Pojman has tried the experiment before using water
    and glycerine onboard NASA's KC-135 "Vomit Comet."
    However, only a few seconds of good microgravity could be achieved--not
    enough to solve the puzzle. Image courtesy John Pojman.</em></p><p>Pojman has planned for some time to investigate
    the problem using a sophisticated experiment called Transient
    Interfacial Phenomena in Miscible Polymer Systems, but the equipment
    won't arrive on station until later this decade. Meanwhile, he's
    going to get a preview of the physics from Miscible Fluids
    in Microgravity.</p><p>The first thing they need for their experiment is some kind
    of container in which to do it. The container needn't be large,
    but it must be transparent so that cameras can record the outcome.</p><p>Unused urine collection syringes fit the bill perfectly. Cameras
    that the space station crew uses to document life in orbit fill
    the data-acquisition role. A video camera will film the entire
    10-minute experiment, and a digital still camera will snap shots
    every 30 seconds.</p><p>While the body of one syringe serves as a container for the
    first fluid, the needle of another syringe will slowly inject
    a stream of the second fluid.</p><p>Air bubbles could spoil the experiment, Pojman says. To plug
    small holes in the syringes that could introduce air bubbles,
    Pojman considered a widely used sealant: chewing gum. "I
    like the idea of an experiment that uses chewing gum," Pojman
    jokes. Nevertheless, they ultimately chose to use Duxseal<sup>TM</sup>,
    a plumber's leak-repair compound from the station's maintenance
    kit.</p><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="234" height="255" align="left"><tr><td><a href="pojman1.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/images/ingenuity/pojman1_med.jpg" width="234" height="255" alt="see caption"></a></td></tr></table><p><strong>Left</strong>: <em>Professor Pojman displays the prototype
    MFMG experiment. Bob Powell, a NASA expert on developing procedures

    about the second one? Pojman says they considered several of
    the materials available on the station: shampoo, shaving cream,
    even ultrasound gel. (The space station is equipped with an ultrasound
    imager for use in medical experiments.)</p><p>In the end they settled on honey. The crew has cans of Russian
    honey on board to use for sweetening their tea. As anyone who
    has had honey in their tea before knows, honey dissolves in water
    quite nicely--<em>i.e.</em>, water and honey are miscible.</p><p>One small Ziplock<sup>TM</sup> bag will serve as a reservoir for
    the water, and two larger bags will dispose of the leftover waste.</p><p>Voila! A microgravity experiment, no custom-built equipment
    required.</p><p>Miscible Fluids in Microgravity will probably take place before
    the end of this year. Although it won't answer all the questions
    about Korteweg's ideas, it's an important prelude to experiments
    that will. Not bad for a few odds and ends -- and a little
    ingenuity.</p><!-- WebLinks --><p><hr><strong>Web Links</strong><br><br>NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research (http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov/)
