    <h1>Discovery of the Omega-minus Particle</h1>
    
            <p>As the list of &quot;elementary&quot; particles proliferated, it became
      obvious to physicists that they must look for some underlying structure
      composed of still smaller and, hopefully, very many fewer
      &quot;elementary&quot; particles. Progress in understanding the structure
      of basic matter, first atomic, then nuclear has, in each case, been
      preceded by a search for order among the seemingly chaotic multiplicity of
      entities. This same approach has been followed for the subnuclear world.
            </p>
      <p>In the early Sixties theorists found in group theory a ready-made
      mathematical description that seemed to provide a remarkably successful
      scheme for classifying the then known hadrons. This scheme was not based
      on any underlying theory of fundamental structure, nor was it derived from
      any abstract principle. It simply provided a concise representation that
      exhibited symmetry and order and, additionally, predictive power.</p>

          <td><p class="caption">The bubble chamber picture of the first omega-minus. An 
      incoming K- meson interacts with a proton in the liquid hydrogen of the 
      bubble chamber and produces an omega-minus, a K° and a K+ meson which all 
      decay into other particles. Neutral particles which produce no tracks in 
      the chamber are shown by dashed lines. The presence and properties of the 
      neutral particles are established by analysis of the tracks of their 
      charged decay products and application of the laws of conservation of mass 
      and energy.</p></td>

      <p>The baryons and mesons known at the time fell into symmetric families
      of multiplets (octuplets, decuplets) sharing two identical quantum numbers
      (spin and parity), but differing in an ordered way in others (mass,
      charge, baryon number and strangeness). The mathematical group to fit this
      complex situation-SU3, the symmetric, unitary group of dimension 3- was
      proposed independently by Professors Gell-Mann at California Institute of
      Technology and Ne'eman at Imperial College, London, and named by Gell-Mann
      &quot;The Eightfold Way.&quot; This new classification scheme, it was
      hoped, might lead in time to an understanding of particle structure just
      as the classification of the line spectra of atoms, following Balmer's
      discovery of order in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, provided the
      first step leading to quantum mechanics and the understanding of the
      dynamics of atomic structure.</p>
      <p>It was thus very important that the validity of SU3 be demonstrated by
      experiment. A major prediction was that a particle (named by Gell-Mann the
      omega-minus), an isotopic singlet with spin = 3/2, positive parity, mass
      of roughly 1,680 MeV, negative charge, baryon number +1, strangeness = -3,
      and stable to strong decay, should exist to complete the 3/2+ baryon
      decuplet. It was therefore a major triumph for the scheme when the
      omega-minus, a
      baryon with the precise mass, charge and strangeness predicted, was
      discovered in 1964 by a team of physicists from Brookhaven, the University
      of Rochester and Syracuse University, led by
      <a href="80_inch.asp#omegaminus">Nicholas
      Samios</a> of Brookhaven, using
      the <a href="80_inch.asp">80-inch bubble chamber</a>. This crucial experiment also verified the
      symmetry breaking by medium-strong interactions which accounts for the
      mass differences within the multiplets.</p>
      <p>Since this discovery further developments have led to the concept of 
      &quot;quarks&quot; as the constituents of hadrons and to new higher group symmetry 
      schemes which embody them.</p>
