<h2 align=center>4 The Meshing of &quot;Tools of Analysis&quot; and &quot;Aids to 
Learning&quot;</h2>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>When dealing with any nonlinear system, especially a complex one, it 
is not sufficient to think of the system in terms of parts or aspects 
identified in advance, then to analyze those parts or aspects 
separately, and finally to combine those analyses in an attempt to 
describe the entire system. Such an approach is not, by itself, a 
successful way to understand the behavior of the system. In this sense 
there is truth in the old adage that the whole is more than the sum of 
its parts...It is of crucial importance that we learn to supplement those 
specialized studies with what I call a crude look at the whole.</dd>

<p align=center>Murray Gell-Mann, Nobel Laureate</p>
<p>I resort to a whole, in importance, yet stunted, in length, chapter in order to emphasize the 
following point. Linear reductionism, as Tools of Analysis, alone is not sufficient to cope with 
today's and tomorrow's problems, just as it was not capable of solving all of yesterday's. 
Nor are nonlinear techniques in the form of Aids to Learning alone sufficient. Instead, we 
require an approach which calls for intertwining or meshing both linear and nonlinear 
reductionist techniques; that is, &quot;tools of analysis&quot; for linear techniques, blending to &quot;aids to 
learning&quot; for nonlinear approaches, depending on the environment involved. Further, linear 
subsystems might be connected in nonlinear ways, just as nonlinear subsystems might be 
interlinked in linear ways. There are these places where the use of appropriate techniques 
will have merit. Often we need a synthesis. One must become ambidextrous-a switch-hitter.</p>
<h3>The 80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>Of importance to this notional continuum of linear and nonlinear techniques is the idea of the 
&quot;80/20&quot; rule. It is widely accepted, not just in Western culture, but most if not all cultures, 
that typically the first part of an endeavor or task is relatively easy. It then gets progressively 
more difficult, and toward the end, gets hard to do. In fact, it is so common that it has not 
only been codified into a saying, but quantified-the 80/20 rule. For example, software 
developers routinely establish as a rule of thumb budgets and schedules which allocate 20 
percent of the dollars and time to the first 80 percent of the project, and the remainder to the 
last fifth. Why? Because time and time again, from generation to generation, the 
phenomenon has persisted, whether in a blacksmith shop or a national central bank trying to 
control inflation. </p>
<p>Suppose that all that accumulated experience and wisdom tells us something with enough 
confidence to take a stab at pinning it down. If we measure the generalized playing field of 
complexity, we find that the &quot;80 yard line&quot; is located just beyond the second bifurcation 
point. See Figure 4.1. </p>

<p>We could postulate this to be the effective limit of linear reductionist techniques, which also 
marks the boundary of mild nonlinearity. After that point, Aids to Learning come into play 
because Tools of Analysis lose their power, especially to provide &quot;good enough&quot; internal 
models for complex adaptive systems (cas). In terms of bifurcation points, this is only 
halfway through the Period-Doubling Cascade. Further, we might assume that Aids to 
Learning can be a useful supplement, or substitute, even earlier. This would also tell the 
practitioner that when the system becomes sensitive to more than two ranges, oscillations, or 
feedbacks, when the environment begins to cloud judgment with more than two effective 
possibilities, that the commander or manager would go into &quot;nonlinear mode,&quot; bringing to 
bear Aids to Learning in order to persevere.</p>
<h3>The New Economy Exemplifies the Need for Meshing</h3>
<p>Today's economy must be viewed as the situation requires-linearly, nonlinearly, and 
sometimes something in between. It therefore provides reinforcement for the argument that 
the meshing of Tools of Analysis and Aids to Learning is necessary in order to be effective, 
to succeed, or to subdue. </p>
<p>Many of you will vaguely remember the principle of diminishing returns from your 
Economics 101 course long ago. Basically, the gist went something like this: A farmer gets 
into peanuts early and starts to make a killing. But this is noticed by other farmers and they 
switch to peanuts, too, thereby increasing the supply and driving down prices. The farmer 
tries expanding, but the price of land increases, and sooner or later, he finds that he or she 
reaches a point where diminishing returns makes it senseless to increase production because 
it does not pay, and equilibrium sets in. That is classical economics and it is linear, caused by 
negative feedback.</p>
<p>Now consider a piece of software, say something called a web browser. The first copy may 
cost $1 million to develop, but the second and ensuing copies go for 99 cents to cover the 
cost of the floppy disk, packaging, advertising, and shipping and handling. But the developer 
is smart enough to give it away free, in order to establish a user base large enough to create 
a de facto standard, thereby creating &quot;early lock-in.&quot; The strategy is to make money off of 
upgrades and bundled features. Essentially, you have increasing returns, because each unit of 
increased production faces none of the perils faced by the peanut farmer. Welcome to the 
world of nonlinear economics caused by positive feedback. The result is that the economy, 
as a whole, is becoming differentiated:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Mechanisms of increasing returns exist alongside those of diminishing 
returns in all industries. But roughly speaking, diminishing returns hold 
sway in the traditional part of the economy-the processing industries. 
Increasing returns reign in the newer part-the knowledge-based 
industries. Modern economies have therefore bifurcated into two 
inter-related worlds of business corresponding to the two types of 
returns. The two worlds have different economics. They differ in 
behavior, style, and culture. They call for different management 
techniques, strategies, and codes of government regulation....Where 
do service industries such as insurance, restaurants, and banking fit 
in?...It would appear that such industries belong to the diminishing 
returns, processing part of the economy. . . [But] (t)hese industries, 
too, are subject to mild increasing returns. . . .In fact, the increasing 
returns character of service industries is steadily strengthening, One of 
the marks of our time is that in services....processing insurance claims, 
supplying and inventorying in retail, conducting paralegal searches for 
case precedents-are increasingly being handled by 
software....Services belong to both the processing and the increasing 
returns world. But their center of gravity is crossing over to the latter.

<p>The concept of increasing returns is the work of W. Brian Arthur of Stanford and the 
complexity theory think-tank, the Santa Fe Institute, who has again been passed over for the 
Nobel Prize. This year it went to a pair of individuals for devising stock market derivatives, 
of all things. The continuing anti-trust action by the Justice Department against Microsoft is 
to a great extent based on increasing returns. It is ironic that there is now case law based on 
nonlinearity, while its applications remain largely unrecognized in other realms. It is almost 
enough to make one say something nice about lawyers!</p>
<p>To recapitulate, the &quot;meshing&quot; framework for the economy looks like this: </p>

<p>Having now made my plea that both linear and nonlinear techniques are vital, and need to be 
used together, we can move on to the next section, where we will examine each of the six 
Aids to Learning individually. Of necessity, both their composition and application are still 
incomplete. While the Metaphor and Van Creveld's Rule are well tested, all remain in stages 
of development. Paradoxically, even when fully developed, each will remain, in Murray 
Gell-Mann's term, a &quot;crude look at the whole,&quot; for that is what nonlinearity both requires and 
prizes.</p>
