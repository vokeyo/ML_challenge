<!-- #BeginEditable "Body_Text" -->
<p>The Gregar Extractor is a compact, simple-to-use yet versatile laboratory 
extractor developed by Master Glassblower Joe Gregar and Chemist Ken Anderson of 
Argonne National Laboratory. Its innovative design enables it to be used for a 
variety of different types of extractions, including: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Solid-liquid extractions</li>
	<li>Liquid-liquid extractions with an immiscible solvent of higher density 
	than the liquid being extracted </li>
	<li>Liquid-liquid extractions with an immiscible solvent of lower density 
	than the liquid being extracted</li>
	<li>Because of its innovative design and ability to perform multiple type of 
	extractions (which in the past would have required multiple separate 
	extractors), the Gregar Extractor was awarded an R&amp;D 100 award in 1999. </li>
</ul>
<p>The basic components of the extractor are illustrated below. It consists of a 
body, a primary condenser, a receiving flask, and depending on the type of 
extraction to be performed, either a thimble or a solvent guide. An auxiliary or 
secondary condenser can also be used if desired. </p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Images/GregarAll.jpg" width="374" height="450"></p>
<p>(Note, exact configuration and proportions may vary from those illustrated.)
</p>
<p>The Gregar Extractor operates on the principle of continuous displacement. 
Solvent is distilled from the receiving flask into the extractor body via the 
vapor arm and condensed at the condenser. From the condenser, the solvent drips 
into the body where it comes in to contact with the material (solid or liquid) 
to be extracted. As fresh solvent is condensed into the body, solvent which has 
already been in contact with the substrate is displaced out of the body and 
returned to the receiving flask. </p>
<p>The extractor can easily be configured to perform several different types of 
extraction by varying the position of the two three-way valves . This 
flexibility is the basis for the Gregar extractor's versatility. However, it is 
possible to mis-configure these valves, which can result in inefficient or no 
extraction. Proper configuration for solid-liquid, and both types of 
liquid-liquid extraction are illustrated and discussed below. </p>
<p>Solid-Liquid Extractions</p>
<div align="left">
	<table border="0" width="37%" id="table1" style="float: left">
		<tr>
			<td>
			<img border="0" src="Images/ExtractSL.jpg" width="171" height="450"></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>When used for solid liquid extractions, the Gregar Extractor is configured as 
illustrated at left. The lower valve is aligned such that solvent flows out of 
the bottom of the body and into the solvent return arm. Solvent flow from the 
body or solvent return arm directly into the receiving flask is prevented. The 
upper valve is configured such that solvent flows up the solvent return arm to 
the level of the valve then overflows into the vapor arm and from there is 
returned to the receiving flask by gravity. </p>
<p>The solid to be extracted is loaded into the extraction thimble, which is 
placed inside the extractor body. Depending on the nature of the sample, the 
material may either be placed directly into the glass thimble, or, in the case 
of fine powders or other samples which might clog the glass frit at the bottom 
of the extraction thimble, into a cellulose, glass fiber or other fine porous 
thimble which is then placed inside the glass extraction thimble. </p>
<p>As solvent is distilled into the body from the receiving flask, the natural 
tendency of a liquid to find its own level causes the solvent to rise in the 
solvent return arm. When this level reaches the level of the upper valve, the 
solvent is able to &quot;spill&quot; over into the vapor arm and, hence, return to the 
receiving flask. As more solvent is continuously distilled into the body and is 
condensed at the condenser, solvent already present in the body (i.e that has 
already been in contact with the solid to be extracted) is continuously 
displaced out of the bottom of the extractor body, carrying with it extracted 
soluble products, and is returned to the receiving flask. This continuous cycle 
effectively extracts the sample by maintaining a continuous slow flow of solvent 
over the sample. Because the solvent level is constant, and the sample fully 
immersed in solvent at all times, sample packing, solvent channelling and other 
problems which can plague conventional solid liquid extractors are eliminated.</p>
<p>Liquid-Liquid Extractions 1:&nbsp; Extracting with an immiscible solvent of 
higher density than the liquid being extracted. </p>
<div align="right">
	<table border="0" width="39%" id="table2" style="float: right">

</div>
<p>When using the Gregar Extractor for liquid-liquid extraction in which the 
extraction solvent is of higher density than the liquid being extracted, the 
extractor is configured in the same way as for solid liquid extraction. That is, 
the lower valve is aligned such that solvent flows out of the bottom of the body 
and into the solvent return arm. Solvent flow from the body or solvent return 
arm directly into the receiving flask is prevented. The upper valve is 
configured such that solvent flows up the solvent return arm to the level of the 
valve then overflows into the vapor arm and from there is returned to the 
receiving flask by gravity. the principle difference between these extractions 
and solid liquid extractions is that a glass thimble is not required. </p>
<p>In this type of extraction, the solvent is distilled from the receiving flask 
to the body via the vapor arm, condensed at the condenser and allowed to drip 
into the liquid to be extracted. Contact between the solvent and the immiscible 
liquid to be extracted is achieved by the drip action, but can be enhanced in a 
variety of ways (use of glass beads, for example) if necessary. Because of its 
higher density, the extraction solvent sinks through the liquid being extracted 
and accumulates at the bottom of the extractor. As in the case of solid liquid 
extractions (above) as solvent accumulates in the body of the extractor, gravity 
forces solvent out of the bottom of the extractor and into the solvent return 
arm, and hence, back to the receiving flask via the vapor arm.</p>
<p>Liquid-Liquid Extractions 2:&nbsp; Extracting with an immiscible solvent of 
lower density than the liquid being extracted</p>
<div align="left">
	<table border="0" width="46" id="table3" style="float: left">

</div>
<p>For this type of extraction, the Gregar Extractor is configured differently 
than for Solid-Liquid or Liquid-Liquid extractions is which the extraction 
solvent is of higher density than the liquid being extracted. In this case, the 
upper valve is configured so that solvent is able to flow out of the extractor 
body and into the solvent return arm. The lower valve is configures such that 
solvent in the solvent return arm is drained into the receiving flask. Unlike 
the above cases, flow out of the bottom of the extractor is prevented. Also, in 
this case a solvent guide is added to force solvent to contact with the liquid 
being extracted. </p>
<p>In this type of extraction, Solvent is distilled from the receiving flask 
into the body of the extractor and condensed at the condensor. From the 
condensor, the solvent drips into the solvent guide, which is placed into the 
liquid being extracted. As solvent accumulates in the guide, the weight of 
solvent will displace liquid out of the solvent giude. When all of the liquid in 
the solvent guide has been displaced by solvent, condensation and accumulation 
of additional solvent will force solvent out of the bottom of the solvent guide. 
Due to its lower density, the solvent will then float up through the liquid 
being extracted and accumulate as a layer at the top of the liquid. When 
sufficient solvent has accumulated so that the level in the body reaches the 
level of the solvent return arm, solvent will spill over through the solvent 
return arm and returned to the receiving flask. </p> <!-- #EndEditable -->
