<a name="1"><H3>Turbomachinery Flow Codes Made Available to Industry</H3></a>

A mathematical analysis has yielded a set of equations governing the conceptual flow model used to design turbomachinery blading. These equations govern the time-averaged flow state existing within a typical passage of a blade row embedded in a multistage machine. They have formed the basis of a series of computer codes, some of which have been written to operate on parallel computing platforms. This flow model is called the average-passage flow model. To date, these codes have been used to examine radial, mixed, and axial flow turbines and axial and centrifugal compressors. These simulations addressed subsonic, transonic, and supersonic machines.<p>

The computer code that solved for the time-averaged flow state existing within a typical passage of a blade row and the code for the associated unsteady flow state have been made available to industry. In addition, gas turbine manufacturers have begun to incorporate the average-passage flow model into their design systems. Results obtained by industry researchers clearly show the unique prediction capability of both the time-averaged and unsteady flow solvers.<p>

<a name="2"><H3>New Technique Calculates Properties of Surface Alloys for Immiscible Metals</H3></a>

Recently, some exciting new experimental observations have been made with the scanning tunneling microscope regarding the formation of surface alloys from immiscible materials (ref. 1). Gold, which would not mix with nickel in the bulk, was incorporated into the top atomic surface layer of nickel. This result leads to the fascinating possibility of having a new class of materials that can alter the catalytic properties of surfaces as well as have special bonding properties at interfaces. An example would be electrical contacts on
high-temperature silicon carbide electronic components.<p>

The experimental exploration of this class of materials requires specialized
equipment and a great deal of effort. We have applied a new theoretical
technique for calculating alloy properties:  the Bozzolo, Ferrante, and Smith
method (BFS) (ref. 2), invented at NASA Lewis to study these alloys. With a
minor theoretical effort we were able to verify the experimental results-a
surface alloy in the top atomic plane for coverages less than half a monolayer, no incorporation of the gold into the second layer, and phase separation for coverages greater than half a monolayer. We also examined a wide range of geometrical configurations that would be difficult to resolve experimentally. The illustration shows the preferred configuration from both the experiment and our predictions.<p>

The efficiency of the BFS method will allow the examination of a multitude of
possible materials, which, combined with ab-initio methods, will enable both
the bonding and electronic properties of the materials to be determined. These efficient theoretical methods will aid in recommending the best candidate materials for various catalytic, structural bonding, and electronic
applications.<p>

<a name="3"><H3>Extended Mixing and Transition Control Theory Evaluated 
Numerically</H3></a>

Considerable progress in understanding nonlinear phenomena in both unbounded and wall-bounded shear flow transition has been made by using a combination of high-Reynolds-number asymptotic and numerical methods. But we are working to fully understand the nonlinear dynamics so that, ultimately, effective means of mixing and transition control can be developed and better understanding of the source terms in the aeroacoustic noise problem achieved.<p>

Two important aspects of the analyses are<p>
<UL>
<LI>That the disturbances must evolve from strictly linear, finite-growth-rate instability waves on weakly nonparallel mean flows so that the proper upstream conditions are applied in the nonlinear or wave-interaction streamwise region<BR>
<LI>That the question of proper outflow boundary conditions-still a research
issue for direct numerical simulations of convectively unstable shear
flows--not arise, since the asymptotic formulations lead to parabolic
problems<P>
</UL>
Composite expansion techniques are used to obtain solutions that account for
both mean-flow evolution and nonlinear effects.<p>

A previously derived theory for the amplitude evolution of a two-dimensional
instability wave in an incompressible mixing layer-which agrees quantitatively with available experimental data for the first nonlinear saturation stage of a plane-jet shear layer, a circular-jet shear layer, and a mixing layer behind a splitter plate-has now been extended to include a wave-interaction stage with a three-dimensional subharmonic. The ultimate wave-interaction effects can give rise to either an explosive growth or an equilibrium solution, both of which are intimately associated with the nonlinear self-interaction of the three-dimensional component. The extended theory is being evaluated numerically.<p>

Wall-bounded shear flow transition in technological devices often occurs in
regions with adverse-pressure gradients, causing the onset of turbulence
usually within a relatively short streamwise distance. The unsteady flow
evolves through a number of stages. For sufficiently small initial disturbances the initial nonlinear stage is associated with a resonant-triad interaction between a fundamental two-dimensional mode and a pair of oblique subharmonic modes. Some of the details depend on the relative amplitudes of the components. When the initial subharmonic amplitude is larger than that of the fundamental, the wave interaction rapidly becomes fully coupled. In the opposite situation the fundamental initially undergoes nonlinear saturation due to self-interaction effects, and subharmonic evolution becomes controlled by the parametric-resonance effects. The subharmonic amplitude continues to increase during this nonlinear-fundamental stage, even when the fundamental amplitude saturates, eventually becoming large enough to influence the fundamental. Thus, the fully coupled stage of development also occurs in this situation-but now with viscous effects being unimportant. The amplitude solutions in the fully
coupled stages always end in a finite distance singularity. The theoretical
predictions are being compared with available experimental results.<p>

<a name="4"><H3>Thermal Radiation Effects Analyzed in Semitransparent Materials</H3></a>

Ceramic materials and coatings must be used for some engine parts to withstand the high temperatures in advanced aircraft engines. Some ceramics are partially transparent to thermal radiation in some portions of the radiation spectrum. Infrared and visible radiation from hot surroundings, as in a combustion chamber, can penetrate the material and heat it internally--like heating food in a microwave oven. Because engines operate at high temperatures, emission of radiation within the semitransparent materials is also important. Internal temperatures depend on radiative effects combined with heat conduction and convective heating or cooling at the boundaries. In addition to steady conditions, transient heating effects must be considered, since radiant penetration can provide more rapid internal heating than conduction alone. Analytical and numerical methods are being developed to predict steady and transient internal temperatures in composites with properties typical of ceramics. The solutions provide thermal performance, and the temperature distributions can be used to examine thermal stresses.<p>

The use of radiative analysis to predict temperature distributions and heat
flows in partially transmitting materials is a continuing in-house effort.
Composites of several layers are being analyzed where each layer can have a
different refractive index. The differing refractive indices cause internal
reflections at the internal interfaces and boundaries. The reflections tend to
distribute energy within the layers by providing additional transmission paths in the portions of the spectrum that are not optically dense-affecting the temperature distributions within the layers.<p>

<H6>Temperatures and heat flows predicted by combined two-flux and<BR>diffusion method in two-layer composite with refractive indices of 1.5 and 3.</H6><P>

The radiative transfer relations are rather complex integral equations, so it
is useful to consider approximate techniques that might be incorporated more
conveniently into computer design programs. One approximate technique is the
two-flux method. It has the form of simultaneous differential equations and is relatively easy to solve for layers that are not optically dense. For dense
layers a radiative diffusion method can be used that has the form of a single
differential equation. In some recent work these methods were combined to
obtain steady-state thermal behavior of a two-layer composite where one layer is optically dense. The approximate solutions were compared with numerical solutions of the radiative transfer equations.<p>

The graph shows results for a somewhat-transparent coating (layer 1) on a
substrate (layer 2) that is more optically dense. Radiative penetration is reduced in the dense substrate, and heat conduction is more dominating. The coating has two spectral absorption bands. Both external boundaries are being cooled by convection. The three sets of curves are for various levels of
radiation flux incident on the hot side. Temperature distributions by the
two-flux and diffusion method are in excellent agreement with the numerical
solutions. The total heat flow through the composite by combined radiation and conduction agrees within better than 1% with the numerical results.<p>
