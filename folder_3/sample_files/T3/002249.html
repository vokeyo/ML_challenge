the President’s Committee of Advisors for Science and Technology</A></FONT></U></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>President Clinton established
the President’s Committee of Advisors for Science and Technology (PCAST)
by Executive Order 12882 at the same time that he established the National
Science and Technology Council (NSTC). The PCAST serves as the highest
level private sector science and technology advisory group for the President
and the NSTC. The Committee members are distinguished individuals appointed
by the President, and are drawn from industry, education and research institutions,
and other non-governmental organizations. The Assistant to the President
for Science and Technology co-chairs the Committee with a private sector
member selected by the President.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The formal link between the
PCAST and the NSTC ensures that national needs remain an overarching guide
for the NSTC. The PCAST provides feedback about Federal programs and actively
advises the NSTC about science and technology issues of national importance.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>O</B>ver the last few
decades, a new paradigm has emerged: Improving and protecting our environment
is compatible with growing the Nation’s economy. As part of this paradigm,
we have come to recognize the essential linkage between the economy and
the environment. We now understand that the sustained bounty of our Nation’s
lands and waters and of its native plant and animal communities is the
natural capital on which our economy is founded. We also realize that a
sound forward-looking economic strategy requires that we protect this natural
capital, rather than damage it and then spend millions or billions of dollars
attempting to recreate what Nature has already given us. To protect our
natural capital, our Nation’s biodiversity and the ecosystems within which
it thrives, we need to have an extensive and frequently updated environmental
knowledge base. This knowledge base is required to evaluate alternative
plans for managing biodiversity and ecosystems as we work to optimize the
union between the environment and the economy.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Our Nation’s environmental
knowledge base and our skills at using what we have are not now sufficiently
well-developed to permit us to formulate the coupled environmental and
economic strategies that will be needed in the 21st Century.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yet, we can harness advanced
information theory and large capacity computational systems to draw our
knowledge together into a clear vision of the biological world. We can
revolutionize this field. At this moment, our society is blessed with a
dazzling array of new tools, from gene sequencers to global satellites.
These tools can enable us to explore environmental questions at several
different scales simultaneously, from sub-cellular to global.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The message of this report
is that new technology can provide us with the tools of discovery and techniques
of analysis that will catapult us into position to meet the challenges
of 21st century environmental and economic policy planning. In the age
of biology, policies that enhance human health and wealth will be the same
policies that protect the biological resources of our Nation and the world.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The PCAST Panel on Biodiversity
and Ecosystems recommends, in this Report, certain targeted investments
in research and education that will bring new tools to bear on old and
new challenges alike. These investments are modest in comparison to the
overall worth of the resources they are designed to enhance and protect,
the yearly dividends Americans derive from natural capital, and current
Federal expenditures in these areas. Thus, they represent a very cost-effective
use of public funds.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Panel recommends that
the Administration:</FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Taken together, the recommendations
will enable us to develop sustainable strategies for conservation, management,
and use of biodiversity and ecosystems. Justification for these efforts,
and details on the expenditures, agencies, and partnerships that might
best achieve the desired results are provided. This Report outlines a unique
interdisciplinary research program, and lays out steps to rapidly develop
21st-century information synthesis capabilities.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Humanity depends upon biodiversity
(all the species of organisms, including their genetic diversity) and ecosystems
(co-existing species, their habitat, and the multiple interactions among
these components) for the very sustenance of life. Biodiversity and well-functioning
ecosystems are themselves interdependent. Ecosystems and the diversity
of species they support underpin our economy in very real, though often
under-appreciated, ways. The living things with which we share the planet
provide us with clean air, clean water, food, clothing, shelter, medicines,
and aesthetic enjoyment. Yet, increasing human populations and their activities
are disturbing species and their habitats, disrupting natural ecological
processes, and even changing climate patterns on a global scale. These
are greater stresses on the natural world than humanity has ever generated
in the past, and we must take responsibility for alleviating the impacts
of our own activities. It is becoming more and more important that we actively
conserve biodiversity and protect natural ecosystems in order to preserve
the quality of human life. We propose that this can be done by enhancing
understanding of the interdependence of the economy and the environment.
This understanding will make it possible to use America’s precious natural
capital to generate prosperity, and at the same time conserve it for future
generations.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>To achieve this understanding,
the United States needs to fully utilize current scientific knowledge in
its conservation strategies, and incorporate new knowledge into them as
it is generated. In addition, because the strength of our economy is linked
inextricably to that of the world economy, the United States should fully
participate in management and conservation of global biodiversity resources
by sharing information and expertise and assisting in building scientific
infrastructure in developing nations, as well as by ratifying the Convention
on Biological Diversity. In both the national and international spheres,
we need greater knowledge than we now possess. We need to know more about
the biodiversity that exists within the United States and the world, and
about how biological systems function under both natural and managed conditions.
In addition, we need means to incorporate explicitly the value of our natural
capital within calculations of agricultural, industrial, and service-sector
outputs, and to provide incentives for conservation by all the sectors
of society that benefit from living resources.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>We need to elevate the national
biological information infrastructure (NBII) to a new level of capability—a
"next generation"—that can make maximal use of, and fully and openly share
on a global basis, the information generated by research on biodiversity
and ecosystems. We need to focus information science research on biodiversity
and ecosystems information to assure that scientific results can be incorporated
effectively into management and policy decisions. And, we need to bring
the results of a great deal of earlier research that are now only found
in static media into electronic format, because the NBII is the mechanism
whereby biological data and information about the environment can truly
be made available for use by all sectors of society. Finally, to enable
Americans to understand the scientific and economic issues associated with
biodiversity and ecosystems, we need to bolster the scientific content
of informal and formal education.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This Panel has made a number
of specific recommendations for refocusing certain ongoing management and
research efforts, and for the allocation or reallocation of resources toward
specific areas of research and development. These recommendations are made
in the spirit of improving the scientific knowledge and infrastructure
that are needed to improve our stewardship of America’s living capital.
The biological, economic, and information science research, and the support
for education, recommended in this Report will require the addition of
up to $200 million annually to current Federal expenditures in these areas.
However, this Panel believes the investment is essential, and that it is
a justifiable and cost-effective use of Federal research funds.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The research that is needed
is associated with many agencies in several departments of the executive
branch of the Federal government, and will require participation by academia,
state and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private
sector including industry. Therefore, the National Science and Technology
Council, particularly the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources,
must actively and consistently coordinate the research program outlined
in this Report.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Panel strongly recommends:</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Scientific Knowledge in
Service to Society</B>. At present, governmental agencies and other entities
that are responsible for managing the Nation’s natural capital often do
so in an uncoordinated—indeed frequently conflicting—manner, largely because
they are operating from differing (and sometimes outmoded) knowledge bases.
Also, many confrontations between advocates for the environment and defenders
of commercial activities could be avoided or resolved by readily accessible,
objective, scientific information. Conservation policy and management decisions
ought to employ the best, most up-to-date scientific information available,
and as new information is generated, evolve to incorporate it. Conservation
and management should also be coordinated across all Federal, state, and
local agencies and among governments and other managing entities. In fact,
the United States should develop a comprehensive national conservation
strategy, building from the elements which currently exist. To formulate
such a strategy, we need to develop, through public-private partnerships
(e.g., among government, industry, and academia), an objective, accessible
knowledge base that includes what we know about species, their characteristics
and interactions, their habitats and ecosystems, how human activities impact
them, and what kinds of actions comprise best practices for managing them.
This knowledge base can then be used to foster local, regional, and national
conservation strategies that are biologically and ecologically appropriate
and economically sustainable. The goal of these strategies should be net
enhancement of natural capital, so that future generations may enjoy the
bounties of nature as well as economic prosperity. These strategies should
include mechanisms for managing and protecting ecosystems sustainably in
the face of global change and guarding our natural capital in all its forms.
There are already some excellent examples of such strategies that have
been developed around the country under the leadership of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), elements of the private sector, or representatives
from local, state, and Federal agencies. The expansion of the capability
of the NBII to deliver, rapidly and accessibly, comprehensive and comprehensible
information for devising strategies, making responsible management decisions,
and resolving conflicts is an essential part of bringing scientific knowledge
into the service of society.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Discovery of Species.
</B>Modern biological tools are making possible a new age of biological
discovery during which we can seek out and catalog previously unknown species
more rapidly than ever before. Scientists estimate that fewer than 30%
of species that occur in the United States have been discovered and described
(worldwide, the total is estimated to be fewer than 15%). Many described
species have useful properties; it is reasonable to predict that some of
those which have yet to be discovered also have beneficial attributes (genetic
resistance to disease, food value, compounds that could become pharmaceuticals,
etc.) that can be employed in sustainable agricultural and industrial development.
The workers needed to perform this research can be Federal, state, university,
or NGO employees, but all will require the facilities of natural history
museums, botanical gardens, herbaria, culture collections, and other research
collections as well as new tools for gene sequencing, phylogenetic analysis,
and information synthesis and presentation. The Report recommends that
total yearly expenditures for discovery of species and their genetic attributes
be raised to a minimum of $130 million (compared to current annual expenditures
of $74 million), phased in over three years. These funds will 1) enable
taxonomists—scientists who identify and describe species—to inventory the
Nation’s biodiversity wealth, 2) train new taxonomists, and 3) support
institutions that house research collections and provide vital biodiversity
information for a multitude of purposes. An effective and efficient NBII
that is interconnected with similar systems in other countries will be
an indispensable tool in this process of discovery.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Ecosystem Research and
Monitoring. </B>Interagency participation in and support for the Environmental
Monitoring and Research Initiative of the CENR should be continued, especially
promotion of the public-private partnerships involved in that activity.
In addition, the capabilities of current ecological monitoring sites to
provide useful data should be evaluated and any shortcomings corrected.
At the same time, experimental research on biodiversity and ecosystems
must be strengthened in order to increase our ability to use the results
of monitoring to predict how ecosystems will respond to multiple stresses
and to maximize the sustainable productivity of agricultural and forest
ecosystems. This research can be conducted at universities, within governmental
agencies, in public-private partnerships between Federal or state agencies
and NGOs, or by other entities. However, the research should be anchored
at a system of study sites that, in parallel to astronomical observatories,
might be called "environmental observatories." The United States has a
number of such sites—National Forest Research Laboratories, Long-Term Ecological
Research Sites, some of the National Parks, etc.—but this system needs
to be expanded to cover the full diversity of ecosystem types found in
the country. Ecosystem research and monitoring also needs to be more fully
interconnected by efficient and effective information management systems,
namely the NBII envisioned above, and to make full use of the most effective
current technology, such as laser technologies to measure gas fluxes, high
resolution remote sensing, and non-invasive near-infrared techniques for
environmental chemistry. Investments in these sites and their research-support
facilities should be increased by approximately $55 million over the current
$300 million per year. A certain proportion of this increase in research
spending should be specifically targeted to theoretical research designed
to discover fundamental ecological principles. There is new sophistication
in analytic techniques, which can be used to further increase scientific
understanding of ecosystems, their vital functions, and the impacts on
them caused by human activities.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Economy and Environment.
</B>Steps should be taken to focus interdisciplinary economic, sociological,
and ecological research on the relationship between the market economy
and natural capital, between society and the biosphere. In recent years,
and certainly in this Report, natural capital has been shown to be the
source of a very large percentage of human economic wealth. Yet, this recognition
is new enough that mechanisms for valuating natural capital and the means
to incorporate that value into assessments of economic output, or long-term
costs to society caused by use of natural capital, have yet to be articulated.
These mechanisms, once defined, can be used to devise incentives for conservation
that will encourage industry, government, and communities to conserve while
still receiving benefits from sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems.
The new approaches to the integration of information from widely differing
fields that are now available will facilitate this research at the interface
of biological and social science with economics. The Panel believes this
to be a vital area of research that can help to reduce the perception of
conflict between the needs of the environment and the strength of the economy.
However, there is currently no mechanism for supporting research directed
at valuation and at development of incentives. The Panel recommends that
the National Science Foundation take the lead in an interagency granting
program to make approximately $24 million per year available for these
highly interdisciplinary, extremely important, but currently unfunded areas.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>National Biological Information
Infrastructure. </B>The research initiatives described above, and resource
management decision-making, require a dramatic increase in the analytical
and synthetic capacities, as well as the information content, of the National
Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII). The Federal government should
push forward to the "next generation NBII" because in its current form,
the NBII is inadequate. At present, the NBII can be used to access information
in databases held by various Federal agencies and other institutions around
the country. However, the system can be used to access only one database
at a time, and for the most part, collation and correlation of data from
multiple databases requires hours of human involvement. The demands of
policy, management, and scientific investigation are such that collation,
correlation, analysis and synthesis of information must be automated so
that people may concentrate on decision-level and creative tasks. Furthermore,
1) databases that are online are by no means as numerous as they ought
to be, 2) those that exist are uneven in the types of information that
they hold, and 3) standards for data exchange in the biodiversity and ecosystem
information domain have yet to be widely adopted. Direct support to the
NBII should be increased at least fivefold to promote the development of
standards and to increase the information content of the NBII in its current
incarnation while the "next generation NBII" is being constructed. The
Federal government should enable development of the "next generation NBII"
by investing a minimum of $40 million per year for five years (and reasonable
maintenance thereafter) in a system of regional nodes at which computer
scientists, information scientists, biodiversity and ecosystem scientists,
and sociologists, using leading-edge tools and technologies, will work
together to develop true interoperability among multiple database types,
new software tools for gathering, analyzing and synthesizing data, new
means of scientific collaboration, new means of presenting computational
results so that biodiversity and ecosystems research findings can be more
readily applied in management and policy, and so on. Among other useful
attributes, such a system will enhance the ability of industry to develop
new products, provide much better outputs for use in education and in management
of biodiversity and ecosystems than is possible now, and further facilitate
scientific advances. Importantly, the enhanced NBII will add value (at
relatively minor cost) to the vast datasets of physical environmental parameters
that the US obtains from its earth-orbiting satellites by making it possible
to readily correlate them with biological datasets in various combinations.
The Panel emphasizes that this "next generation NBII" is fundamentally
important to the accomplishment of all of the research, management, and
education recommendations that form the remainder of the Report. The NBII
envisioned by the Panel will eventually become at least in part self-sustaining—as
did the Internet itself—but the initial impetus for its creation must come
from the Federal government.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Education. </B>Environmental
education should be centered on science. An electorate that does not understand
the natural world or the nature of the tradeoffs that must be made in managing
it wisely and sustainably cannot make informed decisions. Communities that
do not have an understanding of the workings of the ecosystems within which
they live will be unable to function as responsible stewards, and will
thereby too often cause and suffer from losses of biodiversity and ecosystem
services. The Panel recommends that professional development opportunities
be multiplied so that 10,000 teachers per year can increase their skills
for teaching about the interdependence of society and the biosphere in
an unbiased way. The recommended increase (of about $15 million to the
current $72 million per year) in informal educational opportunities will
strengthen the environmental literacy of the American public, and initiate
a mechanism for development of scientifically sound curricula and teaching
materials that would improve the environmental component of science education
in the Nation’s schools.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Panel is convinced that
continuation of traditional resource use patterns and their unanticipated
results (for example, global climate change) will lead to diminishing economic
benefits and degradation of the other services that we derive from our
living resources. To reverse the trend, we must make sustainable use of
the products of biodiversity and ecosystems, and conserve natural capital
for our children and the generations to follow. To do that, we need to
know more than we do about the living world. This Report provides a framework
for research and information infrastructure about the economy and the environment
that will enable the Nation to reconcile the needs of both, a goal the
Panel believes is necessary to meet the challenges of conservation and
sustainable use. The Panel’s recommendations call for specific investment
increases that total less than $200 million per year (phased in over three
years) for research, education, management, and the information infrastructure
to support them all. Current Federal expenditures for biodiversity and
ecosystems research and monitoring (which total approximately $460 million
per year) are too low when compared to the threats that global change and
growing populations present to our natural capital. The Panel believes
the investments recommended in this Report are just that—modest but vitally
important investments in a knowledge base that will yield an incalculable
return by enabling us to preserve our living capital resources as a sustainable
foundation for America’s future prosperity.</FONT></FONT>
