<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>The INL program assistant verified the National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) inventory report through a variety of methods including on-site inspection of local facilities; review of SENAD's in-house written inventory; and inspection of commodities by DEA special agents and country attache. The status of commodities located in the outlying areas was verified by post's review of SENAD's written inventory and through frequent inspections by DEA personnel. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P>All items were provided to SENAD; DOA (Direccion Operationes Antidrogas), formerly DINAR; and SEPRELAD, Paraguay's Money-Laundering Investigative Unit. In addition, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) maintains INL-provided commodities in several field locations including Ybyturuzu and Lima (radio equipment), Ciudad del Este, Mariscal Estigarriba, and Pedro Juan Caballero. 
<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>Twenty vehicle ranging in model years from 1989 to 2001 are currently in use by SENAD for operational and prevention purposes. Also, four motorcycles and two boats with outboard motors and trailers are in use. Eleven vehicles and one motorcycle have been approved for auction by SENAD. 
<P><B>Detector Dogs</B> 
<P>INL funds support the detector dog program, which employs seven dogs. INL funding provides veterinary care, food, new dogs, uniforms, training supplies and maintenance of the kennels and vehicles used to transport the canines and guides. The canine units are housed at the newly remodeled kennels located at the International Airport. 
<P>During the last calendar year, SENAD, DEA, and INL agreed that the canine units would be best used if they were all housed locally and rotated to the outlying offices. An increase in cocaine seizures by the canine units has shown this to have been a wise decision. Twenty-nine individuals and 92 kgs of cocaine have been seized by the canines, the majority at the Asuncion airport and from buses traveling through the Chaco and northern part of the country. 
<P>The canine unit still relies heavily on local law enforcement personnel (SENAD) to obtain necessary search warrants to search bags at the airport. 
<P><B>Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>All communications equipment was accounted for and most is in good condition. Several items could not be repaired because parts are not available. All items ordered were installed in 2003. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B> 
<P>The office and computer equipment are in good to excellent condition, except for the following items which are in fair condition: desk computers (2), refrigerator, filing cabinet, and desk. Two printers are inoperable. Plans are being made to purchase new equipment in the form of cables and connectors needed to establish a LAN system for SENAD and SEPRELAD's Financial Investigation Unit (FIU), once the FIU is permanently housed. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P>All equipment and material go to support the SENAD, DOA, and the FIU. The communications equipment, vehicles, and canine program are aimed at bolstering the interdiction effort. The bulk of the assistance goes toward augmenting the SENAD's operational capability. The SENAD has succeeded in restructuring its field operations by developing specialized teams of investigators. The FIU's budget has been substantially increased, allowing the new Director to hire additional analysts. 
<P><B>BOGOTA</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>The NAS held regular working meetings with the Government of Colombia (GOC) counterpart agencies, such as the CNP Anti-narcotics Division (DIRAN), its air wing (ARAVI), and the Colombian Army (COLAR), to discuss the status of USG-provided assets. Pertinent GOC records were requested and compared with NAS files to assess resource status. 
<P>Eight Foreign Service Officers (FSO) and 24 U.S. Personal Services Contract (PSC) advisers aided EUM data collection in the field through site visit reports and project updates. The NAS Management Officer backstopped the NAS U.S. PSC EUM employee. Six NAS Foreign Service Nationals (FSN) reviewed and implemented monitoring procedures and conducted inventories and audits. Seven NAS FSN voucher examiners reviewed the paperwork on all USG-funded purchases. The NAS also employed about 700 American, Colombian, and third-country contractors through contracts with DynCorp, CCE, and Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC). An additional 51 local-hire Colombian contract personnel served under a DynCorp Aerospace Operations Limited (DAOL) contract. NAS personnel worked closely with GOC EUM officials. 
<P>GOC entities had to receive Embassy authorization to use CN assets for other types of missions. The NAS, CNP, and contractors completed inventories of aircraft parts and equipment at all air bases. The NAS and CNP performed a three-month inventory on USG-provided vehicles at CNP facilities throughout Colombia. NAS logistics advisers regularly updated inventories. The General Accounting Office (GAO) teams reviewed CN assistance to Colombia several times in 2003. 
<P><I>Aircraft-</I>The CNP Eradication and COLAR projects, supported by the NAS Aviation Unit (NAU), accounted for a significant portion of the counternarcotics assets provided through INC/ACI grant aid programs over the past five years. Major assets included fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. NAS advisers received daily aircraft and procurement status reports. A USG-funded contract supported CNP ARAVI aircraft maintenance. A Letter of Agreement (LOA) between the USG and GOC restarted the Air Bridge Denial (ABD) program in August, following a two-year hiatus. Bilateral monthly In-Progress Reviews (IPR) handled policy-level matters, including EUM issues. The USG program manager and the U.S. contractor's site manager conducted field inspections and updated program status in weekly and monthly reports. In accordance with the LOA, U.S. personnel flew aboard each tracker aircraft sortie, providing a mission report to the program manager after every flight. The program manager reviewed the daily sortie reports weekly with the contractor and monthly with the GOC. 
<P><I>Construction</I>-NAS FSO managers, PSC advisors, and three FSN staff members monitored all counternarcotics-related construction projects from development to completion and delivery to CNP end users. NAS personnel ensured counterparts used facilities as intended. 
<P><I>Vehicles-</I>The CNP completed an inventory of 99 percent of the USG-provided vehicles (the remaining one percent were on official assignment). The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) performed EUM on the USG-provided vehicles it gave to the Federal Security Agency (DAS), Judicial Investigations Directorate (DIJIN), Antinarcotics Unit (ANTIN), Special Investigative Unit (SIU), Heroin Task Force (HTF), Attorney General's Technical Investigative Unit (CTI), and the Colombian Navy (COLNAV) intelligence unit. The NAS removed from inventory those vehicles destroyed in the line of duty, or judged to be beyond repair. 
<P><I>Communications Equipment</I>-NAS counterpart GOC agencies managed and monitored their USG-donated communications equipment, reporting the status to NAS upon request. A communications PSC assisted the CNP in conducting programs, identifying requirements, and monitoring program implementation. <I>Computer Equipment</I>-GOC entities working with USG-provided computers, networks, printers, and related equipment, informed the NAS of the status upon request. 
<P><I>Weapons-</I>The CNP and COLMIL maintained strict controls on USG-provided weapons. Two NAS PSC advisors assisted the CNP air and ground programs with weapons. In July, a USG weapons Mobile Training Team (MTT) inspected and refurbished 10,000 USG-provided M16-A1 rifles for the CNP Municipio (equivalent in a U.S. country) Reentry Program, while training CNP personnel in weapon use, repair, and maintenance. 
<P><I>Miscellaneous Equipment-</I>Four NAS PSC advisors and a DAOL logistics assistant coordinated equipment distributed to projects in support of CNP interdiction and establishment of police pressure. A NAS U.S. Army Extended Training Service Specialist (ETSS) provided tactical and operational advice to counterpart ministries in the program to reinsert armed combatants into society. The Department of Justice's (DOJ) International Criminal Investigation and Training Program (ICITAP) inventoried and periodically inspected laboratory equipment donated to the CNP, DAAS, and Office of the Prosecutor General (Fiascala). 
<P>Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) accompanied CNP officials on monthly inspections of NAS-provided tool kits, bomb suits, bomb robots, radio frequency blockers, disruptors, cameras, laptop computers, hand tools, and an explosive repository system donated to CNP Bomb Squad program. Bureau of Prisons (BOP) personnel delivered and inspected USG-equipment equipment to prison administrative and training facilities, conducted security and administrative audits, and maintained a computerized inventory. The NAS began auditing about 10,000 USG-provided CNP field rations in December, over concern that improper distribution was leading to loss and waste of the perishable items. A NAS FSO seaport and airport security manager received monthly reports from seaport antinarcotics and administration police on the status of US-provided assets. 
<P><I>Defense Articles</I>-The NAS held regular meetings with COLMIL, COLAR, and COLAF administrative, operations, and intelligence officers to discuss the nature of USG-provided assets, such as those from Foreign Military Sales (FMS), 506A emergency Presidential Determination, and Excess Defense Articles (EDA). The military services continue to provide complete access to materiel upon request. The MILGP continues to use its military-to military relations to strengthen human rights observance by the Colombian Military forces and to use other personnel resources, i.e., unit exchanges, U.S. students in Colombia schools to further reinforce their commitment. 
<P>The Colombian Military (COLMAR) is extremely cooperative in the receipt, tracking, and maintaining coordination for EUM with MILGP. All equipment that debarks in-country undergoes a joint inventory between the Riverine Logistics Officer and the COLMAR with a hand receipt upon turnover. All parties receive copies, and changes to master lists of equipment provided via FMS, or U.S. grant (1033, 1044, plan Colombia, 506A, etc) are made. The USMC representative, Riverine Plans Officer, Riverine Logistics Officer, and any Riverine Training Teams that are in country conduct End Use Monitoring reports as time pemits throughout the country. 
<P>The Army mission conducted 100% inventory in October 2003 of all weapons and equipment provided to the Commando Battalion. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P><B>Aircraft</B> 
<P>Five K-Max K-1200 helicopters joined the COLAR Plan Colombia program inventory in 2003. These and existing aircraft provided support to the CD Brigade, flying a total of 23,015 hours, carrying some 28,800 passengers and 1,101,268 pounds of cargo, and completing 60 medical evacuation missions in 2003. NAS programs included training for pilots, gunners, and mechanics, and fielding non-US citizen contract pilots to supplement the growing but insufficient number of COLAR pilots-in-command. There were no reported incidents of aircraft abuse. 
<P>Five USG-owned aircraft (four AT-802 Air Tractors in April and a T-65 Turbo Thrush in February) were added to the CNP eradication fleet. Seven aircraft were removed from the fleet during the reporting period: Two OV-10D Bronco airplanes were transferred to Patrick AFB; a T-65 airplane was destroyed when it struck a tree in April; an AT-802 airplane was destroyed when it hit a tree in June; a second AT-802 aircraft was intentionally destroyed on the ground in August by CNP helicopter guns after it had been forced down by enemy fire; a third AT-802 is in the United States undergoing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification; an OV-10D was destroyed when it was shot down by enemy fire in September; and an UH-1N helicopter was shot down, overrun and destroyed by enemy forces on the ground in December. CNP eradication aircraft logged some 8,362 flight hours for fixed-wing and 4,149 for rotary-wing aircraft during 2003. Daily aircraft status reports and accountability of spare and repair parts insured proper use.

<P>The NAS transferred four UH-1H helicopters from the COLAR Plan Colombia fleet to the eradication fleet in order to maintain a necessary minimum of eight UH-1Ns in the latter. Eight Huey II's arrived in country. 
<P>NAS/CNP destroyed a USG-donated UH-1N helicopter hit by guerrilla fire in January when it couldn't be removed from the impact area because of a strong guerrilla presence. A USG-owned and maintained OV-10D spray aircraft crashed in March while on an aerial mission near Larandia, Caqueta, killing the DynCorp employee pilot. The NAS transferred the last two UH-1H helicopters in the eradication fleet to NAS/Lima in March to join operations there. The NAS added five airplanes, including an OV-10D Bronco, a T-65 Turbo thrush, and four AT802 air tractors, to the NAS fleet. Daily reports on aircraft status and close accounting of spare parts ensure proper utilization. The NAS monitored purchases, deliveries and use of aviation fuel at all CNP eradication bases and commercial airports. 
<P>The USG provided three Citation SR 560 tracker aircraft to the Colombian Air Force (COLAF) on a no-cost lease basis, along with training, communications equipment, and operational support. Two COLAF C-26 aircraft underwent refurbishing in the United States to perform radar tracking for CN. They are to return to Colombia in May 2004. NAS PSC and ARINC American civilian contractors worked with COLAF personnel in Bogota and at several COLAF bases.

<P>Changes in NAS-supported CNP aircraft during 2003: Three UH-1H's were added to the rotary wing fleet, including two re-engineered UH-1H's; another was removed temporarily from the fleet the previous year due to extensive repairs required after a hard landing; a UH-1H was lost in January because of an accident; a DC-3 aircraft was destroyed the same month during a night landing at a remote site; a DC-3 was added to the fleet in September. The average availability rate for the CNP fleet was 80 percent. A USG-funded contract supported aircraft maintenance. 
<P>A USG-provided C-208 Caravan arrived in November to provide logistical and personnel transport for COLNAV forces in southeast Colombia. Flight and ground crew training took place during the last two months of 2003. 
<P><B>Aviation Fuel</B> 
<P>Electronic fuel control equipment was installed in March to upgrade the CNP refueling program. NAS PSC advisers closely monitored purchases, deliveries, and the use of USG-provided jet fuel, aviation gasoline and methanol for program-supported police and military aircraft at all bases and airports. NAS voucher examiners reviewed vehicle fuel invoices. A comparison of fuel delivery receipts and daily reports on fuel consumption and hours flown showed no anomalies. 
<P><B>Construction</B> 
<P>The NAS undertook the following construction and installation projects to improve CNP and COLMIL base security and resources use.

<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>USG-provided vehicles facilitated the movement of officials and other personnel, the transfer of materials, surveillance, pursuit of narcoterrorists and illegally armed groups, and arrests and detainment. 
<P>Two hundred eighty-four (284) NAS-supplied vehicles were used for official CNP purposes (transportation of personnel and supplies within Bogota and to CNP bases and FOLS) in 2003. 
<P>A breakdown of the condition of the CNP vehicles indicates that of the 284 vehicles, 168 are in service; 53 are out-of- service; and 63 have reached the end of their useful life and are pending disposal. Most of the vehicles were manufactured prior to 1994. Deplorable road conditions throughout most of Colombia, especially outside of the major cities where most significant counter-narcotics activities take place, make for shorter than normal life spans of vehicles. 
<P>Seventy-one (71) INL-purchased vehicles were given by DEA to host country counterpart agencies for counternarcotics programs with the following agencies: Security Administration Department (DAS), Judicial Police Central Directorate (DIJIN); CNP Anti-narcotics Units (ANTIN), Special Investigative Units (SIU), Heroin Task Force (HTF), and the Attorney General's Technical Investigations Unit (CTI). They are dispersed throughout Colombia including Bogota, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartegena, and Medellin. 
<P>Most of the vehicles are in good condition. DEA added two 2003 Chevrolet Rodeo SUV's for the Cali CTI and DIJIN units to its fleet in 2003. No vehicles were removed in 2003. 
<P>
<P><B>Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>USG-provided communications equipment for GOC counterpart law enforcement agencies significantly increased their ability to conduct counternarcotics investigations and operations. NAS PSC advisers monitored USG-provided secure radios, cellular phones and a new computerized aircraft tracking system at bases and mobile units used by CNP DIRAN to secure communications between aircraft and ground units. DEA inventoried all new communications and intelligence equipment given to the GOC, plus about one-fourth of the equipment issued to the GOC before bar-coding began in 2002. 
<P>The CNP gave the NAS a detailed 38-page inventory of USG-supplied communications equipment. Eight DIRAN technicians did routine maintenance and repair of communications gear. The NAS returned damaged equipment to the original manufacturers and suppliers for repair. CNP inventory records of computers and related USG-provided equipment were accurate. 
<P>DEA provided the NAS with a detailed 14-page inventory containing 299 pieces of USG-supplied communications equipment and other related major items, such as computers, digital cameras, printers, photocopiers, etc. NAS advisers and EUM personnel checked the list but found no major problems. The DIRAN uses a wide variety of communications equipment that is distributed among bases and mobile units throughout the country. A majority of the radio equipment was physically inspected by NAS officers and INL TDY personnel. 
<P>The SIU and Andean initiative programs use a wide variety of communications equipment, i.e., interceptors, radios, recorders, etc. in locations throughout Colombia. DEA agents work closely with the GOC units that receive this equipment to ensure that it is used properly. 
<P><B>Computer Equipment</B> 
<P>USG-provided computer equipment formed the basis of detecting, tracking, identifying, removing and/or detaining narco-terrorists in Colombia. NAS PSC advisors monitored USG-provided computer equipment used to maintain CNP ARAVI logistics, maintenance, training, and aircrew flight records. DEA inventoried new computer equipment given to GOC counterparts. There are 200 computers, 26 printers, and 6 scanners located in the police DIRAN headquarters; Guaymaral; and DIRAN administrative section. Laptop computers are being used by officers assigned to administrative and intelligence positions. 
<P>Computer equipment, including 75 printers were given to the DEA for use by the Special Investigative Units (SIU's). Three Dell Dimension XP266 units had bad power supplies. DEA obtained power supplies for them rather than dispose of them. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B> 
<P>ICITAP reported proper equipment use by its counterparts through on-site visits and inventory control. ATF-provided items delivered to CNP bomb squad and firearms programs were well maintained and stored in secure areas. NAS officials verified that USG-provided X-ray equipment for the Airport Security Program was installed and operable in Cali and Medellin. Periodic CD Brigade updates to the NAS showed that USG-donated items under the Plan Colombia program were property maintained. 
<P>The SIU and Andean Initiative programs also use photographic equipment for surveillance and other law enforcement activities. The equipment includes digital and Polaroid cameras, slide projectors, and video cameras. 
<P><B>Human Rights </B>
<P>No allegations of serious humans rights violations on the part of any counternarcotics counterpart personnel were reported during 2003. Post thoroughly evaluated all CNP/DIRAN and COLMIL personnel attending DOD or USG financed commercial training. After post completed its vetting of potential trainees, a request was made for review by DOS. 
<P><B>Weapons</B> 
<P>NAS PSC advisors monitored the use and operational status of USG-donated aircraft-mounted guns and small guns, as well as weapons training, provided to the CNP ARAVI under USG security assistance programs. The NAS also monitored USG-provided 7.62 mm ammunition for GAU-17 mini-guns and M- 60 machine guns on CNP aircraft supporting eradication and interdiction missions. The CD Brigade gave NAS periodic reports on USG- provided weapons inventory. 
<P>A GAU-17 machine gun, lost in a CNP helicopter accident several years ago, was recaptured from guerrilla forces in November by a U.S. trained and equipped CD Brigade. An investigation was conducted into why the initial loss of the weapon was not reported to the NAS by ARAVI. Procedures were established to prevent this from happening again. 
<P><B>Defense Articles</B> 
<P>COLNAV and COLMAR equipment provided under USG programs since 1989 consists of: (1) 210' medium endurance Coast Guard cutter (WMEC-210 "Reliance" class); (2) CASA-235 aircraft; (1) Bell 212 Helo; (4) Bell 412 helos; (2) PBR MK3 boats; (11) MAKO 27-foot BOA; (14) Zodiac boats; (5) jeeps; (11) 2 ½ ton trucks; (573) M60 machine guns; (435) grenade launchers; (101) 9mm pistols; (123) 50 CAL machine guns; (1) Cessna Grand Caravan; (1) LCM-6; (51) 22-foot Pirana-type tactical craft; (48) 25-foot Pirana-type command and control craft; (25) 25-foot Pirana type command and control craft; (11) 31-foot patrol boats, river MK 2 (PBR); (3) patrol craft Riverine boats; (9) mini-armored troop carriers. 
<P><I>Thirty-year-old ex-USCG Medium Endurance Cutter (WMEC-210)-</I>The cutter has been transformed in an incredibly short time to like new condition. The ship was made ready-to-sail and is nearing completion of a 6-month dry-dock period to perform massive engine maintenance and overhaul.

<P><I>Zodiacs (14)-</I>All belong to the COLMAR Special Forces Battalion located in Cartegena. All are operational. 
<P>COLAF equipment provided under USG programs consists of: seven C-130's, thirteen A-37B's, ten OV-10's, two C-26's, six AC-47's, six SA-237B's, fourteen Bell 212's, two Bell 412's, eight Huey II's, six H500's, seventeen UH-1H's, twenty-two UH-60's, four machine guns, eight floor and door armor sets, six Elbit weapon systems, seven T-37B's, four T-37C's, and one UH-1H simulator. 
<P><I>A-37 (13)-</I>The structural life hours have been exceeded. They are awaiting engineering assistance from Odgen AFB. 
<P><I>OV-10's (10-)S</I>ince 2001, eight OV-10's have undergone service life extension, reengineering, and avionics upgrades at Marsh Aviation in Mesa, Arizona. One aircraft was returned from this program due to financial issues in the company and poor condition of the aircraft. It is unlikely that all eight can be upgraded. 
<P><I>C-26 (2)-</I>Both aircraft are at ARINC, Oklahoma City. Upgrades to incorporate new tracker radar and FLIR are problematic. There are technical issues on integration causing delays in delivery schedule. 
<P><I>C-130 (7</I>)-Two aircraft have been out-of- service since September 2003. They are expected to be back in service by June 2004. 
<P>COLAR equipment provided under USG program consists of: twelve UH-60's, twenty-four M19 MTRS, spare parts, 136 HMMWV's, twenty-six 5-ton trucks, 426 M16A2 rifles, 56 M249 Squad Automatic Weapons, 2020 M9 pistols, 1220 M60E3 MG, 225 shotguns, 77PRC 77 radios, 169 AN PVS 5, 41 TA 212 phones, 225 AN/PSN10 GPS units, ammunition, field gear, flak jackets, and uniforms. 
<P>There was a lack of a weapons repair capability at the time of inspection. The Colombian Army maintenance battalion did not have spare parts nor the weapons repair expertise to fix M240BMG and M249 automatic weapons. The Army mission is working with the Colombian Army to buy enough spare parts and to train personnel qualified to fix M240BS and M249. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P><B>Aircraft</B> 
<P>The USG sprayed 132,817 hectares (raw number) of coca in 2003, compared to the previous year's record of 130,363 hectares, and 3,371 hectares of opium poppy, compared to the 2002 total of 2,992 hectares. NAS and CNP coca eradication verification flights in six departments in November indicated an overall effectiveness rate of 91.5%, representing a significant increase over the previous year's level of 80%. Findings showed replanting rates remained high, but damage to surrounding crops and vegetation was minimal. 
<P>Aerial spray operations remained dangerous in 2003 with USG-provided aircraft receiving 382 hits from ground fire, compared to 194 hits in 2002 and 191 hits in 2001. Aircraft accordingly spent much time in repair, significantly reducing operational availability. 
<P>Fielding all 14 Plan Colombia UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters added substantial force to the CD Brigade and to NAS efforts against narcoterrorists throughout southern Colombia. 
<P>In addition to actively supporting coca spray operations in five departments, the CD Brigade seized seven MT of cocaine and two MT of coca base, while destroying 16 cocaine HCL labs and 948 coca base labs. 
<P>ARAVI aircraft and crews played a significant role in providing support for spray operations. T-65 operations were wholly supported by ARAVI gun ships and Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters. CNP "Halcon" gun ships provided additional cover and were instrumental in rescuing the crew from an eradication helicopter shot down in December. ARAVI participated in numerous interdiction operations and was the principal means of reinsertion of CNP police units into remote areas that had not seen the rule of law for a considerable time. ARAVI provided serial intelligence platforms and support to other police units, as available, with embassy approval. 
<P>Since August 2003, the ABDF program has been responsible for the forced landing of eight suspect aircraft, the destruction of six others, and the impounding of seven more with a corresponding seizure of 7.9 metric tons of cocaine. Information obtained during air intercepts in 2003 was a key motivator for a large-scale joint operation conducted by the CNP and COLMIL at a southeast Colombian airfield used to land chemicals and other items pertaining to the illegal drug trade. 
<P>ICITAP-donated DNA technology was vital in producing evidence that aided investigations and led to arrests. Three NAS-assisted CNP DIRAN airmobile companies, known as Junglas (jungle commandos), conducted lightning raids that captured over 48 MT of coca base and destroyed 83 HCL labs, surpassing the former record of 63 HCL labs. The USG-funded Infrastructure Security Strategy (ISS) program succeeded in enabling Colombian security forces to reduce attacks on the Cano-Limon oil pipeline and other vital infrastructure from 170 in 2001, the year prior to the program, to just 32 in 2003. ATF explosives and firearms equipment significantly enhanced the effectiveness of CNP anti-terrorism efforts, with no deaths of Colombian bomb technicians in 2003, compared to six who died in the line of duty the previous year. NAS supported K-9 units at Colombia's major airports helped the DEA airport Interdiction Program (AIP) seize 155 kilograms of cocaine and 46.42 kilograms of heroin and make 26 arrests in the first three months of operations. 
<P><B>Computer Equipment</B> 
<P>NAS assistance to GOC ministries on the reentry to society program was accompanied by a 40 percent increase in the desertion rate from Colombia's illegal groups. Intelligence from the deserters helped prevent terrorist actions, prosecute criminals, and locate weapons, explosives, drugs, and other criminal material. 
<P><B>Weapons</B> 
<P>USG assistance allowed the CNP to train and equip 62 Carabinero Mobile Squadrons and 140 police municipality stations, approximately 17,000 police in all, for assignment in rural Colombia to areas that had no security presence. This new project supported President's Uribe's principal, strategic goal of establishing public security throughout Colombia. 
<P><B>Defense Articles</B> 
<P>The aircraft and associated assets provided to the COLAR have led to 1,657 missions and 5,332 flight hours in support of counter-narcotics operations during the year. Operational readiness rates of the C-130's improved form 70% to 90% due to contracted logistics support. 
<P>Without U.S. support, the Riverine units of the COLMAR would still be years behind where they are today. The results for 2003 are 23 tons of cocaine interdicted, 70 laboratories destroyed, 52 enemies killed, 1,080 enemies captured, 90,000 gallons of precursor chemicals confiscated.&nbsp; 
<P><B>Problems</B> 
<P><B>Aircraft</B> 
<P>NAS could not perform a one hundred percent audit of all equipment and other assets provided to the Plan Colombia Helicopter Program for counternarcotics activities because of the sheer magnitude of the undertaking. NAS initiative selected auditing procedures, however, to track and monitor USG provided equipment, services, and funds to the extent possible. 
<P>Legal challenges seeking suspension of aerial eradication operations in indigenous territories and national parts worked their way through the Colombian court. The Uribe Administration, however, left no legal stone unturned in an effort to reverse any decision that threatened to halt spraying. The Embassy with NAS assistance redrafted the Colombian Environmental Management Plan to reflect strengthened controls and measures adopted to allay public concerns over the short and long-term effects of the bilateral spray program. GOC, NAS, and DIRAN officials compensated three landowners a total of $11,000 because their properties were inadvertently sprayed in June. The errant spraying occurred when a valve malfunctioned on a spray aircraft. The properties have since recovered and the damage is no longer visible. 
<P><B>Computer equipment</B> 
<P>A robbery in November at a Colombian Prison System (INPEC) warehouse in Bogota resulted in the initial loss of about $356,000 in computers, printers, cameras, and electrical power supply materials. Swift investigative work by INPEC and BOP officials resulted in recouping all but about $19,000 of the stolen merchandise. Proceeds from an INPEC insurance policy covering the missing items was returned to the NAS-funded BOP prison project. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B> 
<P>ATF encountered very few problems with transfers of inventory of equipment provided for the CNP Bomb Squad and Firearms programs. Some CNP officials were reluctant, however, to buy supplies, such as copy toner, to properly maintain the equipment. ATF officials advised counterparts of the necessity of doing so to ensure optimum availability of the USG-provided equipment. Unregulated power fluctuations at the Bogota airport damaged the power supply, as well as the replacement part, of one of the two USG-provided baggage X-ray machines. Because of the high cost of spare parts, DEA deemed it fiscally unsound to continue repairing the machine until the GOC stabilized the airport's electrical supply. 
<P><B>Riverine</B> 
<P>The environment encountered on the rivers of Colombia is incredibly harsh on the equipment. The rivers have a high sediment level that fouls both inboard diesels engines and the outboards. A primary problem encountered with water-jet propulsion, such as the mini-ARC's, has been the rapid erosion of impellers due to high sediment levels. Also, water filters and water intakes rapidly become clogged due to high level of debris in the water. This requires constant crew attention and falls under the realm of proper supervision. 
<P><B>Lack of Quality Fuel</B> 
<P>One of the damaging problems for the COLMAR is the lack of quality fuel throughout the country. Fuel is often delivered thousands of kilometers down river in barges or drums. When it arrives, the fuel is contaminated with condensation and sediment that reduces the quality of the fuel. As a result, poor fuel leads to fouling and high engine temperatures. The Naval Mission is examining how to fix the widespread fuel problem that plagues the country. As an alternative, the Naval Mission is researching the purchase of both fixed based fuel filtration, smaller mobile units to travel with the units, and storage. The problem is compounded by requirements for both diesel and motor fuel. There is an estimated $3 million in start up costs to address the fuel problems at the COLMAR bases. 
<P><B>Program Changes</B> 
<P><B>Construction</B> 
<P>NAS construction supported the new COLAR ISS base in Arauca Department, which provides anti-terrorist security for the nearby Cano-Limon oil pipeline, by building infrastructure that protects ISS helicopters and their flight and maintenance crews. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B> 
<P>The DEA AIP project, originally consisting of the deployment of CNP K-9 units to major Colombian airports and the purchase of three additional body X-ray machines, was enhanced to include information collection into a secure integrate Wide Area Network (WAN) between the various airports. 
<P>
<P>
<P><B>BRASILIA</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>Post maintains regular and frequent contact with the Federal Police and its Drug Enforcement Division (DPF/DRE) to allow close monitoring of donated materiel. DPF/DRE maintains detailed and up-to-date inventories of all assets donated by the USG and submits monthly reports of accounts, including receipts, to the NAS. The NAS and other USG personnel conducted on-site inspections to spot check the location, condition, and use of the commodities during 2003. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P><B>Vessels</B> 
<P>The 36-foot patrol boat provided under the 506(A) drawdown was fully renovated by the Brazilian Police and inaugurated in May of 2001. It is currently in the water at Praca 15 de Novembro (Rio de Janeiro's city port), where it was monitored by the NAS in October 2003. Post certified that the boat is functioning and being used in normal operations. However, there is a shortage of spare parts. The NAS plans to assist the Federal Police in acquiring a new propeller. The DPF installed GPS/VHS equipment, as well as a depth finder and a police siren. It is used exclusively in harbor patrol crime prevention activities. 
<P>According to NAS and DPF/DRE records, there are currently twelve donated Boston Whalers in Brazil. They are assigned to Belem (4), Manaus (4), Tabatinga (1), Porto Velho (1), Guajara-Mirim (1), and Foz de Iguacu, Parana (1). Post inspected eleven of the Boston Whalers in 2003. All of the boats in Belem need minor repair work on the hulls and major electronic work and repairs to their outboard motors. Post plans to work with the police to improve the condition of the boats. 
<P>In Manaus (4), Tabatinga (1), Porto Velho (1) and Guajara-Mirim (1), the boat motors are problematic and require a great deal of upkeep and maintenance. As diesel fuel is more economical and more widely available in Northern Brazil and diesel engines are simpler and easier to fix and obtain parts, the federal police are interested in possibly using diesel engines. The police mentioned that occasionally they use craft other than the Boston Whalers for fuel economy reasons. The DPF has also expressed interest in having radar, depth finders, and GPS for the Boston Whalers. The floating dock in Manaus is fully operational. 
<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>The Ford van donated to ABRACO ( Brazilian Community Association of Parents for the Prevention of Drug Abuse) was sold at auction with proceeds going to support demand reduction activities and operating costs of the organization. The van was suffering from a lack of available parts and expensive maintenance and operation costs. 
<P><B>Detector Dogs</B> 
<P>During an inspection in December 2003, three dogs were seen using the same pen. To adequately house the dogs, the kennel needs to be enlarged. Post will work closely with the police to ensure that the kennel is appropriately expanded and maintained. 
<P><B>Computer Equipment </B>
<P>In 2002, basic computer equipment, including monitors, CPU's, printers, webcams, keyboards, speakers, and UPS, were provided by the NAS through SENAD for use by the 26 Brazilian State Drug Councils (CONENS) as well as a connecting unit for SENAD and the CONEN of the Federal District. In 2003, the NAS staff visited 14 CONENS. All of the equipment was observed in use and functioning, creating an "Antidrug Informational Network" connecting the state Drug Councils with SENAD in Brasilia. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B> 
<P>On-site inspections and DPF/DRE reports indicate that most USG-donated communications gear, including two-way radios and fax machines, are operational, in good condition, and being used regularly in police counternarcotics operations. Other donated equipment, including transformers, and bulletproof vests, are also used regularly. Most of the equipment is held in Brasilia and shipped around Brazil as needed for operations. Careful computerized inventory control of this equipment is maintained. 
<P>In 2002, through the Brazilian National Public Safety Secretariat (SENASP), the NAS provided basic law enforcement equipment including computer equipment, narcotics kits, flashlights, first aid kits, CPR masks, life vests stearns, night vision goggles, handcuffs, gun cabinets, bolt cutters and bullet proof vests to several Brazilian State Police. During 2003, NAS personnel visited five of the states and certified that the equipment was in order and being used regularly. 
<P>
<P><B>Problems</B> 
<P>The sheer size of Brazil and its difficult physical, climactic and infrastructure conditions present a unique challenge to the understaffed and underfunded Federal Counter-narcotics Police. This same vastness makes EUM of donated equipment difficult, time-consuming and expensive. The NAS is composed of one U.S. officer and two FSN's. Through careful use of limited travel funds, assistance from DEA agents as they travel about the country and receive help from our three consulates, the NAS was able to check a sizable representative sample of equipment in a wide variety of places in the country. The DRE in Brasilia is trying to maximize the use of this equipment through a centralized inventory and warehouse operation which sends equipment where and when needed and brings it back to the central headquarters in Brasilia. Although the system, particularly the computerized inventory controls, seems to function adequately, regional superintendents are unhappy about not having direct control over the equipment. 
<P>Despite the centralized inventory and just-in-time delivery of equipment to where it is needed for a particular operation, the need for more support for police field offices is clear. This is particularly obvious in operations requiring rapid reaction where there is insufficient time to ship equipment from Brasilia. On those occasions, the regional DPF makes do with what they have or what they can borrow from other government institutions. The NAS will study the regional situation more thoroughly in 2004 and make every effort to provide support, whether equipment, training or funding for operations. The NAS will also ensure that assistance is distributed where it is needed most and will be best used. 
<P><B>BUENOS AIRES</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>Embassy officials, primarily DEA officers and the Narcotics Affairs Coordinator, take advantage of periodic visits to the provinces and to Buenos Aires-based agencies to assess appropriate use of INL-funded equipment. In addition, trusted law enforcement officials provide post with periodic reports on equipment use. Post has requested that receiving agencies provide a status report on the equipment, although compliance has been sporadic at best. Post has also found that maintenance requests for previously provided equipment give a good indication of where that equipment is currently located and how it is being used. Post believes that this system of overlapping verification methods presents post with an accurate end-use appraisal. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P><B>Dogs</B> 
<P>DEA reports that on recent visits its agents observed that the two dogs provided to the Northern Border Task Forces (NBTF) are healthy and being proper cared for. The original two have been joined by six more who were either purchased or bred locally. The total force of eight dogs allows the handlers to maintain a rotation schedule that ensures the safe and efficient use of the animals. They are healthy and being properly cared for by their handlers. The dogs and their trainers would benefit from USG-provided training. The original two dogs are nearing retirement age. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B> 
<P>Post continues to personally observe that both National and Provincial Police forces make good use of the miscellaneous equipment (handcuffs, vests, flashlights, cameras, etc.) provided to them. 
<P><B>Joint Information Coordination Center (JICC)</B> 
<P>A lack of funding to operate and maintain the Joint Intelligence Communications Center (JICC), combined with unwillingness on the part of other Government of Argentina (GOA) agencies to share information with its current custodian, the National Drug Secretariat (SEDRONAR), has made it a non-working system. Post has argued that the JICC would be more effective if placed under the control of a law enforcement entity. Post believes that this will make the other GOA law enforcement agencies more willing to share information between themselves and the USG, using the JICC as a medium. However, based on the age of the equipment, provided in 1991, with software last updated in 2000, it would take a considerable investment in new hardware and software to bring the JICC back on line, even if a change in jurisdiction took place. 
<P><B>Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>Radio transmitters provided to counterdrug task forces in Salta and Jujuy provinces require routine maintenance and repair. A repeater radio antenna in Mendoza Province had to be moved to improve reception. Post repaired numerous hand-held radios provided to the federal and provincial police throughout Argentina because of wear and tear resulting from routine use under harsh operational and climactic conditions. All other communications equipment is accounted for and functional. 
<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>Post provided 20 vehicles to the Argentine Provincial Police Forces in the 1988-93 period. The vehicles are almost all out of service due to their age and hard use in rough conditions. Vehicles provided more recently (1993-1997) require fairly extensive routine maintenance on suspension and brakes. Two Ford Taurus station wagons require automatic transmissions that can only be purchased in the United States. 
<P><B>Problems</B> 
<P>There is a need for the GOA to sign end-use and retransfer agreements before post can provide more equipment and support. The GOA understands that it will receive no new INL funding until the agreement is signed. Sovereignty issues and concerns about human rights language contained in the standard LOA have delayed signature. 
<P>In addition, Argentina has been under Brooke Amendment sanctions since September 30, 2003. This will preclude post from obligating any new INL funding until the GOA pays its arrears. Thus, until the GOA signs the LOA and gets out of Brooke sanctions, post will be unable to get new INL funding to provide more equipment, support and routine maintenance. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P>While the INL-funded program in Argentina has been a small one, it has had a positive impact especially on the perennially under-funded provincial police anti-drug units. The equipment donated to the NBTF in Salta Province in 1998-2002 and to the Groupo condor unit in Jujuy Province in 2000-2002 continues to be put to excellent use. In 2003, the two NBTF's were involved in the seizure of 507.9 kilograms of cocaine, and 181,132.6 liters of precursor chemicals. No marijuana was seized by the NBTF groups, while 41,924 metric tons of coca leaf were interdicted by the NBTF groups. In addition, 111 traffickers were arrested and 30 vehicles were confiscated by the taskforce. 
<P>
<P><B>CARACAS</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>The NAS received comprehensive reports from the National Anti-Drug Commission (CONUID). These reports, together with discussions on their content, provided detailed information on counternarcotics activities during 2003. The NAS held frequent meetings with CONUID and various Port Security Program entities (Port Authorities, Airport Directors, National Guard Commanders, etc) to discuss and evaluate ongoing narcotics control activities. The NAS and other embassy personnel performed spot checks and on-site inspections of donated equipment at the Prosecutor's Drug Task Force (PDTF), the Port Security Project, CONUID, and the National Financial Intelligence Unit (UNIF). The host government cooperated fully and allowed the NAS to effectively monitor donated resources. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P><B>Dogs</B> 
<P>In 1998, the NAS provided six (6) dogs in conjunction with a training visit for Venezuelan canine program personnel to the U.S. Air Force Lackland AFB canine program personnel. In 1999, the dogs began to produce litters of puppies to provide a source for drug detection dogs. The breeding dogs are kept at the canine training center in Barquisimeto. The NAS and USCG sponsored the TDY assignment of a dog handler to assess and support the canine unit. During 2002, the USCS Canine Center donated two new dogs to the unit. At the same time, the NAS entered into a contract with a local veterinarian to improve the health and nutrition of the neglected animals. The state of health of the dogs quickly improved greatly, although the National Guard has not effectively employed the animals primary function of drug detection. 
<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>During 2001 and 2002, the NAS provided the PDTF with 15 motor vehicles and two motorcycles. One sport utility vehicle rolled over in a single car accident in 2002. It was determined to be a total loss. Another sport utility vehicle that was stolen in early 2002 was later recovered undamaged. It is back in use with the Task Force. 
<P>A Ford Festiva sedan, donated to the National Commission Against the Illicit Use of Drugs (CONACUID) is in good condition. This vehicle is assigned to the CONACUID program coordination office. 
<P>
<P><B>Vessels</B> 
<P>Four of the six Boston Whalers donated by NAS to the Venezuelan Navy in 1993 remain operational. They are based in Puerto Ayacucho in the South of Venezuela. The vessels are fully engaged in a Riverine patrol program. A major goal of the program is to interdict narcotics and chemical precursor smuggling on the Orinoco River. 
<P>Relations between the Embassy and the Venezuelan Navy are good. USMILGP access to the Venezuelan military bases is an essential tool in conducting 506 (a)(2) EUM. Such access is being increasingly restricted under the current administration. 
<P><B>Computer Equipment</B> 
<P>In 2003, the NAS provided seven additional computers to UNIF in the Superintendency of Banks (SUDEBAN) to support its expansion of personnel from 20 to 60. This was part of a tri-lateral cooperation wherein the British Embassy, UNIF, and the NAS each provided seven computers. In 2002, the NAS provided five additional computer workstations, five printers, a video projector, two laptops, two Iomega zip drives, and software to upgrade the UNIF. The equipment upgraded the previously existing LAN, which is used to compile and analyze financial information through a comprehensive system of currency transaction reporting similar to that required in the United States. Relations between the Embassy and SUDEBAN are excellent. 
<P>Two computers with printers donated to the National Guard command in Tachira in 1999 continue to be used for data base operations. Relations between the regional command and the Embassy are good. 
<P>The mini computer network the NAS provided to the Training and Coordination Division of the Public Prosecutor's Office (Fiscalia General) in 1998 continues to be used with NAS-sponsored training programs for implementation of the new judicial reform program which took effect in July of 1999. This reform has changed Venezuela's judicial system from a paper intensive system to an oral, adversarial system of justice similar to that used in the United States. Relations between the Embassy and the Public Prosecutor's Office are excellent. 
<P>The eight computers and four laptops provided to the PDTF in 2001 continue to be operational and in use by the unit. 
<P>The National Guard Anti-Drug Command continues to use a NAS-donated computer LAN installed in 1999 as a database and an up-to-date link to other military commands. Two computers and printers donated to the National Guard Command in Tachira in 1999 continue to be used for data base operations. 
<P><B>Laboratory Equipment</B> 
<P>The National Guard continues to make effective use of laboratory equipment donated by the NAS, including mass spectrometers/gas chromatographs, infrared spectrophotometers, microscopes, electronic balances and other items. The equipment is located in the central National Guard laboratory in Caracas and in the regional forensic laboratories established in 1996 in San Cristobal and Puerto La Cruz. The equipment is overdue for maintenance and repair. 
<P>The NAS funded the maintenance and repair of mass spectrometers and other scientific equipment donated to the PTHJ toxicology Laboratory in previous years. 
<P><B>Defense Articles</B> 
<P>In 1999, the USG completed delivery of the following items to the Government of Venezuela (GOV) under Presidential drawdown authority under Section 502 (A) (2): 82-foot Point Class Coast Guard cutters (2); LCM 8 utility Landing Craft (1); PBR Riverine patrol boats (6); C-26 aircraft (2); PRC 77 radio sets and related equipment (77). The MILGRP plays an active role in checking on the status of these items. 
<P><I>Cutters</I>-The two 82-foot Point Class cutters named the Albatross and Pelican are stationed in the Eastern part of Venezuela. They are located at the Punta Fijo naval base on Venezuela's western Caribbean coast. They are in good operating condition. The starboard engine on the Pelican was replaced in 2002. Both are used in detection and monitoring patrols off the east coast of Venezuela and along the maritime boundary with Trinidad and Tobago. Both are in excellent condition and have greatly increased the Venezuelan Navy's capability to operate effectively within the important 25-mile offshore coastal waters of Venezuela. Both ships were inspected by MILGP officers in 2002. 
<P><I>Landing Craft</I>-The LCM Landing Craft named Margarita is being used by the Venezuelan Coast Guard to support Riverine patrol operations. It is located at Ciudad Bolivar on the Orinco River. It was inspected by MILGP officers in 2002. It is in good operating condition <I></I>
<P><I>Riverine Patrol Boats-</I> Six Riverine patrol boats are in use by the Venezuelan Marines. They are located on the Orinoco River at the Colombian border and support efforts to control Riverine contraband of drugs and chemical precursors. The boats' outboard Yamaha 75-hp engines vary in condition from good to fair. These boats were inspected by a USMILGP officer in March 2002. 
<P><I>Aircraft</I>-The two C-26 aircraft have been incorporated into "Grupo Cinco" of the Venezuelan Air Force and are based at the air base in Caracas. The aircraft are in excellent condition and are well maintained. Although originally intended to support Venezuelan military drug interdiction operations along Venezuelan's long border with Colombia, the Venezuelan Air Force is now considering employment of these aircraft in an air interdiction mode following the increase in the number of drug smuggling flights through Venezuelan airspace in 1999. To carry out this role, the aircraft will need to be equipped with sensors that will cost about $2-3 million. The Venezuelan Air Force is studying means to acquire this equipment. <I></I>
<P><I>Radios-</I>Seventy PRC-77 radios sets have been transferred to the military communications authority. This equipment is to be used along the border. The radios are in excellent condition. 
<P><B>JICC</B> 
<P>The NAS continues to provide support to the Joint Information Coordination Center (JICC) in conjunction with the Latin America JICC/Guardian program coordinated by DEA with the interagency El Paso Intelligence Center. No new equipment was provided in 2003. In 2000, the NAS assisted the center in upgrading its equipment by providing Oracle software and related training. The Oracle database software is being used in conjunction with a new version of the Guardian software developed by DEA. CONACUID uses the Center to coordinate drug intelligence, and collect information on all types of drug-related crime. A photocopier, one of two servers, ten computer workstations and related equipment are in good condition. 
<P>During the second half of 2003, an engineering study was conducted to determine networking upgrade requirements for CONUID and the JICC. 
<P><B>Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>The majority of the radio communications equipment provided to the CONACUID is in good condition and located in the new CONACUID office building in Caracas. The equipment is used for general office functions and for security of the CONACUID headquarters building. Cooperation between CONACUID and the Embassy is excellent. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B> 
<P>In 2000, the Public Prosecutor's Office received a photocopier. In 1998, the NAS provided two contraband inspection kits to the National Guard detachments in Puerto Cabello and San Antonio de Tachira, the major land entry point from Colombia. The equipment is being used for drug interdiction programs. Ninety NAS-procured hand-held metal detectors were donated in 1996 for prisoner searches in the thirty-two Venezuelan prisons. Most have reached the end of their useful lives. The PTJ continues to use audio-visual equipment, camcorders, typewriters, fax machines, cameras and lenses. This equipment is in fair condition. 
<P>The wide-screen television and VCR provided to CONACUID have ceased to function. 
<P><B>Problems</B> 
<P>The ordered departure of most American employees from December 2002 through February 2003 resulted in the closure of the Narcotics Affairs Section during this period. Shortly after the re-opening of the NAS, the NAS Logistics Assistant, who had primary responsibility for EUM monitoring, was permanently medevaced from post. EUM activities were interrupted as a direct result. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P>NAS-provided equipment and training have been fundamental to the enhancement of Venezuela's drug interdiction capabilities, particularly in the Port Security and Prosecutors' Drug Task Force projects. Notwithstanding the political chaos and economic problems of 2003, Venezuela continued to conduct a broad spectrum of narcotics control operations. Cocaine seizures rose to under 18 metric tons in 2002 to more than 32 tons in 2003, with Venezuela placing second only to Colombia in this category for all of Latin America during the last two years. Heroin seizures remained at about half-a-ton in 2003, making Venezuela's fourth consecutive year leading the continent in this category.

<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>Post monitors equipment supplied through contacts by post RSO and MLO with the (GDF), Customs Anti-Narcotics Unit (CANU), Joint Information Coordination Center (JICC), and the Guyana Police Force (GPF). 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P>All USG-provided equipment has been accounted for. Most equipment is in use. Equipment not in use requires repairs, which are not cost-effective to complete at this time. 
<P><B>Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>CANU continues to use the mobile communication system provided in 1988 on patrols at the Timehri airport, although three of the original 12 radio units have been lost. One of the two base-stations radios is serviceable and in use; the second is unserviceable. Two multi-radio chargers are both serviceable and in use. Six single radio chargers are serviceable and in use; six are unserviceable. 
<P><B>Patrol Boats</B> 
<P>The four 44-foot patrol boats were used by the GDF Coast Guard to conduct patrols of Guyana's maritime territory. All four received replacement radar units to simplify maintenance and improve interoperability. 
<P><B>JICC</B> 
<P>The JICC and its four Acer Acros 486SX computers, the installed Oracle software and the fax machine are functional, but not in active use due to the inactivity of the JICC. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous</B> 
<P>Twenty-four bulletproof vests were supplied to CANU in 1998. They are used at the airport and on patrols and operations at the Georgetown port. Life jackets, narco test kits (12), lamps, night vision binoculars (6), and an answering machine provided in 1997 are used by the CANU. Six handcuffs are serviceable and in use; six are unserviceable or lost. Six bulletproof vests are serviceable and in use but are effective only against .32 ammunition or below. 
<P>The video camera and compact recorder provided to the GPF in 1997 are still in use. The fax and copier machine supplied to the GDF are both serviceable and in use. 
<P><B>Problems</B> 
<P>The GOG cooperated with post on monitoring efforts, although institutional inefficiencies sometimes made reporting overly complicated. Monitoring efforts were also constrained by post's staffing limitations. Post's lone political officer handles INL issues; there is only one RSO at post. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P>The vessels continue to provide the bulk of the GOG's maritime capabilities. They are actively patrolling the country's maritime territory. In 2003, the vessels made further seizures of fishing boats operating illegally in Guyana's territory. The vessels' limited speed restricts their use in narcotics interdiction. Of the other agencies, CANU has made effective use of the equipment supplied. Other equipment supplied has been used inefficiently or not at all. 
<P><B>LA PAZ</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>During 2003, under the general supervision of the NAS Director, the NAS Administrative Officer, other members of the NAS staff, and officials of other agencies such as DEA, MILGRP and USCG conducted reviews to account for and to verify the condition of equipment and property provided to the Government of Bolivia (GOB) counternarcotics program. NAS project officers, Regional Directors and the Administrative Officer conducted regular and unannounced field visits to all projects. Field assistance visits by the budget and audit staffs resulted in spot inspections of property records, impress fund record-keeping usage reports, and fuel management. US direct hire program officers require adequate justification and strict accountability prior to initiating new procurement actions. A procurement status report is prepared monthly and distributed to the regional directors and project officers for their information and review. 
<P>The NAS operates eight warehouses: three in La Paz, one in each regional office and FOL and one at the headquarters of the Green Devil Task Force (GDTF) in Santa Cruz. Project officers, Regional Directors, and the NAS Administrative Officer and Logistics Supervisor conduct spot checks during periodic visits to the field. The NAS two-person audit staff performs spot checks and undertakes special reviews or audits to help ensure proper use and care of equipment and materials. Each auditor reports directly and independently to the NAS deputy director. The Property Control Officer receives all incoming property other than that procured locally by the NAS regional offices; prepares receiving and inspection reports; affixes barcodes (when required); and enters control information into the NEPA system. When property is delivered to the respective regional offices, additional documentation, along with a computer file, is created. Each month, the NAS administrative officer prepares a countrywide reconciliation report. Copies are maintained in the La Paz office. 
<P>Post's software monitoring fuel consumption is regularly modified to improve controls across all NAS projects. An auditor reviews all fuel accountability reports monthly to ensure that consumption is within approved levels. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P><B>Aviation</B> 
<P>Most NAS-supported aviation assets are operated by the Bolivian Air Force (FAB) personnel assigned to the Red Devil Task Force (RDTF). They are supervised by PSC's. The RDTF inventory consists of 15 UH-1H helicopters, one B-55 Beech Baron, three Cessna 206's, and two Cessna 210's. All are based in Santa Cruz with permanent Forward Operating Bases (FOB's) in Trinidad and Chimore. A U.S. contractor, DynCorp, has maintenance and training responsibilities for the helicopter fleet. Only the NAS Director or Deputy Director can authorize non-routine missions. 
<P>The Black Devil Task Force (BLKDTF) flies the C-130's under the supervision of a U.S. citizen PSC Aviation Advisor. The BLKDTF consists of 18 FAB pilots, co-pilots, and navigators, and 48 enlisted maintenance personnel; it flies in-country logistics and overseas cargo missions in support of USG-GOB CN programs. 
<P>The C-130B program is also supported by three Third Country National (TCN) contract mechanics who provide quality assurance and supervision for FAB mechanics. The NAS also employs a fourth TCN to provide logistics support and manage C-130 warehouse operations, thus guaranteeing accountability for C-130B parts and equipment. 
<P>The aviation advisors regularly report the operational status of all NAS-supported aviation assets to the NAS Director and Deputy Director. NAS contract personnel and RDTF/BLKDTF personnel participate in inventory management and property oversight. 
<P>All NAS-related air missions are approved by the USG personnel. The status of all NAS-supported aviation assets is reported to the NAS Director or Deputy Director. NAS contract personnel and RDTF personnel participate in inventory management and property oversight. 
<P><B>Defense Articles</B> 
<P>Defense articles were procured up to FY 1995 with FMFP funds. Due to lack of available funds from this source, the NAS, with MILGP assistance, has taken full advantage of the FY-98 506A drawdown program for those items not otherwise available or that are restricted from purchase with INL funds. Under this program, the NAS received ammunition and explosives valued at $1,106,000 for the Special Force for the Fight Against Drug Trafficking (FELCN). Additionally, the NAS received parts and supplies for the C-130 aircraft valued over $1 million. Field gear such as binoculars, radios, blankets, uniforms, field jackets, first aid kits, sleeping bags, tents, etc., along with ammunition, parts and equipment received under the 506 drawdown program totaled more than $6 million in 2000. 
<P><I>Bolivian Army</I> - During 1991, the USMILGP delivered weapons, ammunition and radios to two Bolivian Army light infantry battalions, the Mancheg and Jordan battalions, as part of a requirement calling for equipment and training. Although these units are not actively engaged in the counternarcotics effort, they are considered by the GOB to be available on a contingency basis for use in counternarcotics operations. The following equipment was provided: 870 rifles- 5.56MM; 176 pistols; 96 grenade launchers; 25 radios, AN/PM 77. All the equipment remains in serviceable condition with the exception of the two PRC-77 radios, which are in need of major repair. 
<P>In 2002, the MILGP used reprogrammed FMF CN funds to purchase 280 M4 carbines, 4 machine guns-5.56mm, 2 machine guns-7.62mm, 190 shotguns and 50 M9 pistols for the FELCN Headquarters to be used by the UMOPAR Force in the Chapare. The FELCN headquarters in La Paz has responsibility for the distribution, accountability, maintenance and repair of the firearms received through the FMF program. MILGP staff conduct periodic inventories to verify the use and serviceability of firearms released to the FELCN.<I> </I>
<P><I>Bolivian Navy</I> - In 2002, the MILGP provided the Devil Task Force (BDTF) with the following radios and weapons for counternarcotics Riverine operations: 20 hand-held Motorola radios, 20 sets of computer equipment, 6 laser printers, 8 150HP outboard motors, 16 40hp outboard motors, 2 LCD projectors and 10 24k BTU window-type air conditioners. USCG training teams and MILGP personnel conducted spot-checks during 2002 and determined that all items inspected are in serviceable condition and are being used as intended. The 10 Motorola radios and seven 150 HP motors are in good condition; the 31 GPS units are in good condition and in use; the 5 HF 125/400 base stations are in good condition and remain in use; two of the 35 HF radios are undergoing maintenance, the remaining radios are in good condition and in use. The MILGP took the 10 night vision goggles back so they are no longer monitored. BDTF has 81 M-16 rifles (5.56mm), 118 Beretta (9 mm) pistols, and 51 M-60 machine guns (7.62mm). All are in good condition. 
<P><I>Bolivian Air Force (FAB)</I> -The MILGP did not receive any FMFP supplies for the Bolivian Air Force in 2003. All equipment received in previous years is being used for counternarcotics operations. It is inspected regularly by members of the MILGP and/or MTTS and remains in good condition. The following equipment was provided to the FAB: 17 rifles, 5.56, M16A2; 56 pistols, 9MM; 4 HF radios 25/125W; 4 HF radios 15/400W, base station, two HF radios, 20W manpack. 
<P><I>Bolivian Army Transportation Battalion</I>- The GDTF operates and shares a military post with a logistics battalion in Santa Cruz. The GDTF's primary mission is to transport fuel, cargo and personnel throughout Bolivia via ground in support of the Bolivian counternarcotics strategy. The secondary mission of the GDTF is to train Bolivian Army personnel in conducting all levels of specialized vehicle maintenance, warehousing operations, and operation of heavy US military vehicles. Currently, there are military vehicles acquired through the FMF program managed by the USMILGROUP. The GDTF vehicle fleet consists of 46 two and a half-ton trucks; 27 HMMWV'S, 8 five-ton dump trucks; 3 five-ton tractors, two 5-ton wreckers, 2 forty-ton tractors, 2 contact trucks, 3 international fuel trucks, 2 fuel tankers, 2 semi-trailers, 1 semi-trailer low-bed, 4 water trailers, 1 Hyster fork lift, 2 petty bone fork lists., and 5 NAS program vehicles. The GDTF is staffed by 135 Bolivian Army personnel commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel. NAS personnel total nine, with the temporary hire of two mechanical technicians under the supervision of one U.S. PSC who maintained an operational readiness posture of 98 percent during 2003. 
<P><I>Joint Task Force</I> -During 2003, the Joint Task Force (JTF) consisted of 1,563 military, police and civilian personnel. About 1,000 of the JTF eradicated illicit coca plants, while the other half provided security for the camps and in the coca fields. Feeding the JTF is a major undertaking. A food service contract established in 1999 and renewed in 2003 improved the quality of food, provided better accountability and reduced costs. One NAS FSN COR is designated to monitor the contract, traveling regularly to the Chapare to conduct spot-checks in base camps. The NAS also provides food in the Chapare to the Ninth Division (the Bolivian army unit charged with keeping the road through the area open) and the Tropical Operations Unit. 
<P><I>Expeditionary Force (FEC)-</I>An Expeditionary Force (FEC) was created to assist the eradication process in the Chapare by patrolling the main access route between Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. The FEC was originally a 500-person unit; in February 2002 its size was increased to 1,500; it was disbanded in July 2002. The NAS provided the FEC with food (under the JTF feeding contact), military equipment and bonuses. 
<P><B>Riverine</B> 
<P>The NAS-supported Blue Devil Task Force (BDTF) is a 196 man Riverine unit of the Bolivian Navy organized into six groups, a headquarters, and a Riverine training school. The BDTF has five mother ships, 32 Boston Whaler-type patrol boats, and 42 Zodiacs. These boats were transferred to the Bolivian Navy via FMF funding or (in the case of mother ships) constructed with INL money. Only four of the mother ships are currently in service. In 2003, the NAS supported the construction of a sixth mothership, whose completion is expected in March 2004. The fifth ship will be retired when the sixth ship is completed, leaving a total of five in service again. 
<P>During the year, the NAS continued the replacement of the aging Zodiacs. BDTF task groups are located at Trinidad, Riberalta, Guayaramerin, La Horquilla, Cobija and Puerto Villaroel. The NAS regional office in Trinidad supports all task groups (except for the Grouo in Puerto Villaroel which is supported by NAS/Chimore), the BDTF headquarters, and the Riverine school. 
<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>The NAS provides some form of support for more than 1,200 vehicles either procured or donated by the U.S. Government or other donor governments for use in NAS-funded activities, including the heavy-duty type vehicles assigned to and operated by the GDTF. The NAS operates repair facilities and maintains a large stock of spare parts for all programs in Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Villa Tunari, Trinidad and the UMOPAR Base Camp in Chimore. Maintenance supervisors closely monitor the issuance and use of parts through vehicle work orders, inventory tracking cards, computerized inventory programs and spot checks at each location. As an added precaution against misuse or theft, certain parts (e.g., tires and batteries) are marked with identifying numbers or symbols. Field advisers, project officers and the administrative officer make frequent unannounced inspections of these facilities to ensure proper accountability. The audit section conducts periodic reviews of commonly used parts (those most susceptible to pilferage), as well as of those items most subject to misuse or theft (e.g., fan belts, filters, and tune-up kits). 
<P><B>Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>NAS communications equipment includes repeaters, base stations, mobile radios, and hand-held radios. This equipment was provided to all the FELCN, UMOPAR, Intelligence units, AIROPS, Riverine as well as NAS regional offices. The NAS has supplied 616 sets of communications equipment, including repeaters, base stations, mobile radios, and hand-held radios to Bolivian counternarcotics projects as follows:

<P>Another 230 hand-held UHF equipment sets and 10 base UHF stations do not appear in the NAS inventory, since they were purchased with DEA funds. NAS maintains a comprehensive inventory under the NEPA system that identifies location and personnel accountable in each organization. All equipment maintenance is performed by NAS technicians, normally in the NAS repair facility in La Paz. Frequent field visits are made to verify the condition and proper use of the equipment as well as to perform preventive maintenance. As of 2002, 90 percent of the equipment was in service. The remainder is undergoing repair. Furthermore, the NAS purchased communications equipment in 2001 for installation in the area of the Yungas as part of a nationwide communications grid. It was completed in 2003. 
<P>The Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) of DEA/NAS conducted a thorough inventory of all communications and technical equipment purchased by the NAS on their behalf. All equipment was found to be in serviceable condition. The inventory includes all technical communications equipment and vehicles transferred to various offices and DEA-supported projects throughout Bolivia. 
<P><B>Computer Equipment</B> 
<P>In 2003, the NAS provided 363 computers and six computer servers to GOB agencies participating in NAS-funded activities. Part of this equipment was dedicated to the creation of a wide area network (WAN) for the GIOE's intelligence work. The GIOE project included Local Area Networks being established in cities across the country. The 175 computers provided to the GIOE in 2001 remain in good condition. 
<P><B>Uniforms and Field Gear</B> 
<P>In 2003, the NAS procured 26,000 sets of BDU's, boots, hats, and such field gear such as web belts, field packs, hammocks, tents, and entrenching tools, valued at more than $2.5 million, in support of 1,600 FELCN police officers. Two thousand military personnel are assigned to various counternarcotics projects. 
<P><B>Construction</B> 
<P>In 2003, the NAS was engaged in various building projects that improved the physical and technological infrastructure available to support NAS-funded activities. The 24 building projects completed during 2003 included the following: BlkDTF hanger in El Alto; UMOPAR base in Riberalta; UMOPAR base in Guayaramerin; K-9 facility in El Alto; K-9 facility expansion in Chapare; and K-9 facility in Cochbamba. 
<P>Construction engineers/architects, working under NAS supervision, advise, design and provide oversight during the design and construction phase of construction projects. In addition, program managers and regional NAS office directors routinely monitor all phases of construction. 
<P><B>Problems</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Misuse of Vehicles</B> 
<P>The misuse of vehicles is a perennial problem, despite post's best efforts to control it. Personal use and careless operation of vehicles by senior Bolivian officials are both too common. Although NAS training projects have helped reduce the number of serious vehicle accidents, traffic mishaps attributable to negligence continue to occur. The NAS policy of requiring mandatory restitution in cases involving negligence has been a useful, but not a totally effective, deterrent. Future training on proper operation of vehicles through the FELCN should help to address this weakness. 
<P><B>Fuel Distribution</B> 
<P>Controlling fuel distribution is a perpetual problem for the NAS, given the remote locations in which some NAS-funded projects operate and the atomization of the fuel delivery industry in Bolivia. Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) in many locations eliminate the need for the NAS itself to transport large quantities of fuel over long distances. A multi-year fuel contract was awarded in 2003 that has alleviated the fuel distribution problems. Frequent audits and an evolving fuel monitoring system have also contributed to improvements in the accountability of the use of all types of fuel. However, some units must still rely on primitive means to measure and distribute fuel. Inaccurate pump meters and manual methods account for most of the discrepancies in the fuel distribution program. In order to overcome these discrepancies, new pumps have been ordered. Some have arrived and have been installed. 
<P><B>Weapons</B> 
<P>Safe storage facilities continue to be of great concern in some of the more remote areas. Open storage with containers exposed to the sun and other weather conditions are common problems. Accountability and safeguarding of weapons is a continuing problem throughout. Recently, there was a theft of 53 M-9 pistols, five M-16 rifles and one RPG-7 from the 9<SUP>th</SUP> Division Arms room facilities. The 9<SUP>th</SUP> Division commander was relieved of duty. Two suspects were arrested on December 31. The MILGP is working with headquarters on getting a 100% serial number inventory and on establishing measures and procedures to safeguard sensitive items. 
<P><B>Property Accountability</B> 
<P>It is extremely difficult to track equipment that Defense Articles received through the 506 drawdown program. The FELCN's record keeping is not yet sophisticated enough to track property from unit to unit and even less capable of tracking property issued for special operations. The related issues are complicated by the fact that the title for material acquired through the FMFP and the FMS process transfers to the GOB at the time shipments are placed in transportation channels at the point of origin. By accepting the standard terms and conditions stipulated in the respective LOA, the GOB also accepts responsibility for the accountability and end-use of the Defense Articles purchased. The NAS is training FELCN logistics personnel to improve their property accounting methodology to address this weakness. 
<P><B>Personnel Changes</B> 
<P>JTF personnel are rotated three times per year. Transportation arrangements are coordinated by the administrative officer using GDTF assets, commercial buses and C-130 transport. In the past, large numbers of personnel rotated from various programs have created continuity problems as well as increased costs. The NAS has been successful in getting FELCN and service commanders to stagger the rotation so that no more than 20 percent of a particular unit transfers in any given year. 
<P>
<P><B>Program Changes</B> 
<P>A major needs assessment study of the INL/NAS Bolivia Law enforcement Development Program was conducted during the early part of December 2002. Several counternarcotics forces units in various locations were interviewed regarding training and experience in several areas. Among these areas were law enforcement training in human rights and Basic Criminal Investigations to include the "Ley 1008" new code of Criminal Procedures, oral trial system, report writing, court room testimony, crime scene investigations and evidence collections procedures. 
<P>Based on the results of this cross-country survey, the Law Enforcement Development Program (LEDP) will begin a multi-agency training curriculum to include USAID, MSD, DEA and MILGP participants. Training courses will consist of 40 hours of basic Human Rights training as well as 80 hours of Basic Criminal Investigations to include the above-mentioned training topics. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P>A highly effective eradication program in the Chapare, Bolivia's principal coca-growing region, is the hallmark of the GOB's counternarcotics strategy. The GOB is still developing an effective strategy for controlling coca cultivation in the Yungas. The GOB reported that 10,018 hectares of coca were eradicated in 2003. Despite this success, the potential cocaine production from Bolivian cultivation (assuming that all coca, including legal coca, is used) is estimated to be about 60 MT. 
<P>In 2003, the GOB seized 152 MT of coca leaf, 5,964 kg of cocaine HCL, a record 12.8 MT of cocaine base and 8.5 MT of cannabis. The FELCN Chemical Unit seized 546,252 liters of liquid precursor chemicals (acetone, diesel, ether, etc.) and 538,144 kg of solid precursor chemicals (sulfuric acid, bicarbonate of soda, etc). It also destroyed 1,769 cocaine labs and made 3,902 arrests. NAS logistics support in conjunction with DEA's operational guidance supported these successes. 
<P><B>LIMA</B> 
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P><B>Inventory Management</B> 
<P>NAS Logistics is an eight-person Logistics Section headed by an American PSC employee, with primary responsibility for coordinating End Use Monitoring activities. The Logistics Section is charged with customs clearances; shipping/receiving of all NAS commodities; preparing donation letters; maintaining inventories; and coordinating EUM spot-checks. 
<P>The logistics database contains detailed information on commodities and EUM inspection visits. It can be sorted by location to facilitate EUM spot-checks. NAS Logistics manages warehouse facilities in Iquitos and at the Lima airport. It has implemented extensive controls to enhance security at these locations. NAS Logistics also assists the Military Assistance Group (MAAG) in conducting EUM inspections and tracking DOD-donated items. 
<P>In January 2003, the GOP implemented drastic changes in customs clearances laws and regulations pertinent to the import of materials under the bilateral counternarcotics agreement. Prior to this change, counternarcotics materials were imported as "war materials" with the cooperation of Peruvian Police customs dispatchers. Standard shipments were cleared in 24 to 48 hours. 
<P>The NAS staff performs regular and ad hoc EUM inspections throughout the year. Participants include project advisors of all NAS programs. Aviation assets are reviewed by two Participating Agency Service Agreement (PASA) US military officers, ten American Personal Services Contractors (PSC), field adviser security specialists and one American PSC Petroleum Logistics advisor. A U.S. Coast Guard PASA shares responsibility for EUM of Riverine assets with the logistics section. Two eradication and alternative development advisors and a program specialist monitor commodities and assets donated to CORAH (Coca Reduction Project) and its subdivision, CADA (Coca Measurement Corps). The Institute of Tropical Corps is a non-governmental organization dedicated to improving crops that can be substituted for coca. This project is monitored by the NAS Eradication Advisor. INL's Regional communications Adviser conducts spot checks during the year to verify the condition and location of communications equipment. MAAG personnel visit military installations to perform spot checks on Defense Articles provided to the Peruvian Armed Forces and Drug Police under security assistance programs for counternarcotics purposes. DEA special agents assist in monitoring equipment, materials and consumables provided to the Peruvian National Police (PNP). 
<P><B>On-site Inspections</B> 
<P>During 2003, NAS Logistics visited six cities and met with 16 counterparts at 25 different sites to conduct inspections of 1,261 donated items out of a total of 6,004 items subject to inspection. The balance was inspected in 2002. The NAS visited all sites containing large concentrations of equipment and any site where discrepancies have been noted in the past. Both unannounced and announced EUM visits were performed throughout the year. Inspection results were compared to the existing NAS inventory to produce a computerized list of discrepancies. These discrepancies were reported to the appropriate NAS program adviser for any required action after allowing the counterpart a reasonable time to locate any shortages or correct errors. 
<P>Throughout the year, logistics also tasked Peruvian counterparts to submit up-to-date inventories, including location and condition information for all donated commodities. 
<P>The Embassy's administrative section is responsible for the physical inventory of non-project (NAS) personal property maintained on the Embassy's NEPA system. A NAS administrative assistant oversees non-project, non-expendable personal property. NAS Logistics is responsible for the inventory of NAS personal property at Forward Operating Bases and locations. During 2003, property book inventories of NAS program materials consisting of 4,407 items were completed in Pucallpa, Iquitos, and Lima. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P>All commodities are used full-time in the conduct of counternarcotics activities, including construction and logistical support. While conducting EUM inspections of counterpart sites, Logistics found no evidence of improper use of donated materials. In addition, the cooperation of counterparts as a whole was satisfactory. 
<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>The NAS Logistics maintains an inventory of about 527 vehicles nationwide, supporting fully or in part 132 motorcycles, and 74 program-supported vehicles. The vast majority of the vehicles are provided to various elements of the central and regional Drug Police (DINANDRO and DIVANDRO), the Aviation Police (DIRAVPOL), the Coca Reduction Project of the Upper Huallaga (CORAH), its sub-division, the Coca Measurement and Eradication Verification Corps (CADA). CORAH/CADA have 44 vehicles and 29 motorcycles in their inventory; ICT has three vehicles and 19 motorcycles. The Ministry of Education and Judicial Prosecutors, the Chemical Control Group, and the Peruvian Customs Service also use NAS-donated vehicles. 
<P>On December 24, 2002, a CORAH motorcycle (Honda XL-185) was stolen in Tarapoto. A police report and an insurance claim were filed. During 2003, a settlement was received; the motorcycle was replaced at that site. 
<P>The NAS<I> </I>employs a FSN motor vehicle maintenance supervisor under the Logistics Section, who is charged with overall responsibility for tracking project vehicle fleets, maintaining stocks of essential spare parts, and providing guidance concerning appropriate schedules of preventive maintenance. Aviation personnel are charged with overall responsibility for all "special use vehicles" (a/c tugs, fuel trucks, fire trucks, forklifts, etc.) including preventive maintenance. During 2003, NAS logistics acquired a replacement vehicle from DEA as a transfer, up-grading the fleet at no cost to NAS. The replaced vehicle was disposed of in accordance with regulations. 
<P>The NAS requires counterparts to provide proof of preventive maintenance when requesting NAS financial assistance for major repairs to vehicles purchased with project funds. Aging project fleets remain a problem, but a schedule of more frequent replacements is benefiting operations. In 2003, NAS Logistics disposed of 19 inoperative/obsolete police vehicles and three NAS program vehicles. 
<P><B>Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>In 2002, the NAS purchased and repaired radio equipment to support interdiction and eradication missions. One Motorola secure repeater, with a solar power system, was purchased to support operations in the Huallaga valley. The repeater system will provide secure radio communications for all anti-narcotics operations in the area. The NAS also purchased 24 additional cellular phones to augment communications among units for project coordination. 
<P>Project equipment was provided to DEA's Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) in 2000. The units have continued to expand and to produce quality information. 
<P><B>Computer Equipment</B> 
<P>The NAS continues to upgrade computer systems for counterparts, including surge suppressers and UPS as necessary in areas where the electrical current is unstable. In addition, the NAS is assisting counterparts to improve internal communications through LANs and web connections. Post encourages counterparts to automate inventory, case management and filing systems. These help to improve internal controls, produce a smoother flow of paperwork and provide more accurate documents. Computer equipment is maintained at the assigned sites and used for the intended purposes. The NAS Police and Communications Advisor initiated a pilot project with DIRANDRO and Peru's Narcotics Prosecutor's Office to track/expedite the legal processing of all narcotics cases. The hardware/software system includes: 1 server, 21 PC's, software and accessories. They will be installed at the Prosecutor's Office, DINANDRO, and Lima's courts this year. The "Judicial Tracking system" will be implemented on a larger scale if the pilot project is successful. 
<P>Additional project equipment was provided to DEA's Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU's) in 2002. DEA agents performed End Use Monitoring activities throughout the year. They did not find any instances of equipment being misused, poorly maintained or used for purposes other than those intended by the USG. 
<P><B>Defense Articles</B> 
<P><I>Drug Police (DINANDRO and DIVANDROS)-</I>Weapons procured with FMF funds for use of DINANDRO and DIVANDROS participating in the counter-narcotics program are surveyed periodically by the NAS and MAAG representatives. There is no evidence that the equipment is being used for any purpose other than police counternarcotics operations. All monitored equipment was in serviceable condition. The NAS monitored 200 M-60D machine-guns and 131 M16A rifles received from DLA; 12 Smith &amp; Wesson 357 Cal M-19, 14 M4 carbines, received from the RSO. The NAS with INL approval, provides non-lethal weapons to the PNP. The non-lethal weapons include 12 complete pepperball systems. <I></I>
<P><I>Riverine-</I>The DOD-equipped 7 Riverine Interdiction Units (17 personnel, four Boston Whaler type boats and a floating maintenance facility comprise a typical RIU). The program also provides for improvements to existing Coast Guard and Drug Police infrastructure to support Riverine operations, including office space renovation and repairs to existing equipment. The NAS, DEA, and MAAG program coordinators conduct frequent field visits to observe training, equipment use and storage practices for all GOP forces. The level of maintenance of donated equipment has been marginally satisfactorily. The GOP has not funded minor outfitting or consumable expenses (fuel, MRE's, or medical supplies), or kept life safety equipment in good repair. 
<P><B>Aircraft</B> 
<P>The NAS supports a total of sixteen USG-owned INL Air Wing UH-1H helicopters that are operated by the National Police Aviation Directorate (DIVAVPOL) for counternarcotics interdiction and eradication missions. INL rotary wing assets are based at the NAS hanger in Pucallpa where all major helicopter maintenance is performed. The hangar also supports two fixed wing assets, a C-27 cargo aircraft capable of carrying 34 passengers or heavy cargo and a C-208 single engine passenger aircraft capable of carrying passengers or light cargo. The C-27 is pressurized to permit flights over the Andes; the C-208 is not pressured and usually operates east of the Andes only. GOP MI-17 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are also used for counternarcotics operations. If needed, the NAS rents small aircraft to move personnel and cargo to locations east of the Andes. 
<P>The NAS inducted eight additional UH-1H's for the Huey II conversion. They should be delivered in May 2004. A-37 fuselages provided to the Peruvian Air Force in 1992 and 1996 have been cannibalized for repair parts. Two modified GOP C-26's are expected to arrive in August 2004. These aircraft are in Newfoundland, Canada at the Provincial Aviation facility. The upgrades will include refurbishment of the aircraft, and installation of a communication suite, a FLIR and target acquisition radar. 
<P>NAS Aviation Program personnel and the INL Air Wing contractor DynCorp, managed and performed EUM activities for the NAS Aviation Program in 2003. DynCorp and NAS aviation personnel maintain flight and maintenance records for all INL aircraft. No diversion of NAS-purchased parts and equipment has been detected. The Aviation Program advisor controls aviation property. A 100 percent inventory for 2003 was completed. All items have been bar-coded and entered into the inventory control software program. 
<P>In 2003, the aviation program (UH-1H's) logged 4,342.1 hours of flight time in 881 interdiction flights totaling 1,295.7 hours and 630 eradication missions totaling 824.6 hours. The NAS also funded fuel and per diem to DIRAVPOL MI-17 and fixed-wing crews during operation 2003, totaling over $343,296. During 2003, the C-27 flew 523.7 hours in support of post's counternarcotics program, transporting 477 passengers and cargo. 
<P>
<P><B>Fuel</B> 
<P>The NAS provides all fuel required for the UH-1H helicopters and the fixed-wing aircraft. The NAS also pays for fuel for police fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters on an occasional basis for selected counternarcotics missions. The NAS closely monitors all fuel ordering, receiving, and dispensing procedures to control both the supply and quality of fuel stocks for aviation and riverine operations. The NAS has Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) with fuel suppliers and transporters and has strict ordering, receiving and payment procedures. In 2003, 777,123 gallons of aviation fuel was purchased at a cost of $1,087,972. An additional $165,000 was paid to transport the fuel from Lima to forward locations. NAS in-house quality control of aviation fuel is strictly monitored through daily, weekly and monthly testing, weekly spot-checks and monthly audits. Additionally, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) conducts quarterly inspections of DOD quality assurance of all in-plane contracts, which includes both NAS BPA's. They both meet or exceed standards established by DOD Defense Logistics Fuel Division. 
<P>The NAS stores and dispenses fuel from seven locations in Peru. Six are east of the Andes; the seventh supplies fuel for the C-27 in Lima. The main facility is in Pucallpa and has a maximum Jet-A capacity of 45,000 gallons. Tingo Maria has a capacity of 18,000 gallons of Jet-A1. Aguaytia, Santa Lucia, Mazamari and Pichari all have at least 20,000 gallon capacities. All locations have CORAH-contracted refuelers who report daily to the NAS embassy field coordinator in Pucallpa. The NAS Petroleum Logistics advisor visits allocations at least quarterly. 
<P><B>Construction</B> 
<P>The NAS continued to provide limited construction support to advance counternarcotics operations through CORAH. During 2003, CORAH carried out 119 projects at a cost of $1,890,570. This included 44 small projects for aviation, and for the police program. In all cases, renovated facilities were used for their intended purposes. 
<P><B>Computers</B> 
<P>The NAS continues to provide upgraded computer systems for counterparts, including surge suppressors and UPS, as necessary, in areas where the electrical current is unstable. In addition, the NAS is assisting counterparts to improve internal communications through LANs and connection to the web. Post encourages counterparts to automate inventory, case management and filing systems to improve internal controls, produce a smoother flow of paperwork, and provide clearer and more accurate documents. Computer equipment is maintained at the assigned sites and used for the intended purposes. 
<P><B>Demand Reduction</B> 
<P>The NAS provides funding to a number of institutions, including entities of the GOP and NGO's to promote drug awareness, prevention and treatment programs. A large portion of Demand Reduction funding goes to support training programs. In addition, the NAS has provided vehicles, computers, office equipment, and other commodities to its demand reduction counterparts<B>.</B> 
<P>Over the last three years, the GOP as well as private NGO's have developed an institutional capacity to carry out demand reduction activities. While self-sufficiency in the funding area has not yet been realized, the level of technical expertise within the country is remarkable. 
<P>The NAS is working with the National Strategy Information Center (NSIC), a US-based NGO which has a grant from INL to develop a school-based "Culture of Lawfulness" program. This program will teach ethics and provide school children with knowledge of the importance of living "by the rules." 
<P><B>Problems</B> 
<P><B>Importation of Goods</B> 
<P>The GOP made significant changes to the law regarding importation of goods into Peru. The resulting changes required the NAS to acquire new electronic customs software and hire a licensed and bonded person to comply with the new clearance system and process implemented by the GOP in January 2003. This change resulted in an increase in customs clearance time and cost. 
<P><B>Tracking database</B> 
<P>During EUM inspection visits of police sites, logistics noted that several units were lacking qualified personnel and/or were poorly equipped to track property. Logistics has proposed and received approval to assist these units by supplying excess NAS computer systems, an in-house developed database, training for tracking materials, and assistance in developing procedures. 
<P>During EUM inspections, logistics noted that some counterpart sites, (mostly Police Units) had received hi-tech office equipment, i.e., copy machines, fax machines and printer. Because of toner cost and high maintenance, some machines were not in use. In the later part of 2001, Logistics proposed the review of purchasing practices in an attempt to provide the counterpart with simpler equipment that is easier to maintain and represents a lower cost, especially for remote counterpart sites. Although the situation improved during 2002, the problem still exists. 
<P><B>Interdiction/Customs Project</B> 
<P>The NAS ceased its donation of commodities, including vehicles and communications equipment, several years ago, when Customs could not or would not account for donated goods. In the interim, the NAS continued to provide some training assistance. In December 2001, after several attempts, NAS Logistics was successful in obtaining a list showing present locations and condition of all 138 items donated. In 2002, Logistics visited Customs sites in Lima to verify the existence and condition of equipment. Much of the equipment has been disposed of as obsolete. Only 50 percent was available for inspection. Although the equipment had exceeded its useful life span, Logistics has requested and is waiting for an official response regarding the final disposition. 
<P><B>Santa Lucia Police Base</B> 
<P>The GOP has not maintained this large base. Many buildings are completely abandoned, and some have major structural damage. The runway's condition poses such a significant safety hazard that it was temporarily closed to all USG fixed-wing assets in December 2003. It continues to pose a safety hazard to PNP aircraft. In 2003, the NAS Police Program started an advanced training/operations school at Santa Lucia. 
<P><B>Riverine</B> 
<P>In 2002, a Bilateral Peru Riverine Program (BPRP) was implemented to provide guidance to the GOP to conduct Riverine counternarcotics interdiction operations. Major commodities provided includes safety/emergency equipment, fuel, boat spare parts and spare engines, police boat overhauls. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P>INL project funds provided through the NAS are the sole source of support for CORAH. The NAS completely funds all coca eradication, and all the activities of CADA for coca measurement and eradication verification east of the Andes. While the GOP provides significant resources in support of counternarcotics activities, it does not provide any funding for CORAH and its eradication activities. CORAH conducted a total of 659 eradication missions during 2003, eradicating over 7,000 hectares. 
<P>The Government of Peru has had continued success throughout the year in conducting law enforcement operations. Over the period, however, the price of coca leaf rose well above the farmer's break-even point, signaling that additional action is needed to reverse the trend. The statistics in seizures and arrests follow: </P>

<P>More cocaine base laboratories were destroyed in 2003 than in the previous twelve years combined. Although the Coast Guard and PNP conduct routine patrols, the Riverine Program has not produced any tangible results. The NAS is working in concert with DEA and MAAG to introduce a performance-based incentive program to encourage the Police and Coast Guard to work together on counternarcotics operations. 
<P>The aviation program continues to be the cornerstone of the counternarcotics program. Without the airlift and emergency evacuation capabilities of the 16 INL helicopters, the eradicators would not have been able to operate in many coca growing locations. The ability to move operations quickly form one location to another added an element of unpredictabilility needed to safely operate in areas of grower resistance to eradication missions. Aviation moved 10,318 passengers in 2003. 
<P><B>MONTEVIDEO</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>During the year, embassy officers performed spot checks and an annual on-site inspection at the Coast Guard (Prefectura) and at the Uruguayan Anti-Drug Unit, Directorate General for the Repression of Illicit Drug Trafficking (DGRTID). These agencies provide an annual inventory report, which specifies the use, status, and location of all equipment supplied by the USG. The Embassy maintains contact with these officials throughout the year with regards to training opportunities, drug seizures statistics, and equipment status. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P><B>Computer and Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>Most of the computers are in good condition. Eleven new computers were donated in 2002. Embassy-provided computers are used by accountants to monitor financial drug-related activities, by analysts looking for drug-related activities, and for general office use. Computers are also used to network with the Ministry of Public Health in an information-sharing program concerning sale and distribution of potential drug precursors, which falls under the Health Ministry's jurisdiction. 
<P>Some of the older, renovated computers have been sent to Rivera and local police stations to improve communication and data sharing. A number of older printers are also out-of-service, but new donations are replacing these older machines at a reasonable pace. 
<P>The Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) maintains computer equipment, a monitor, a specialized printer, and software for the analysis of financial transactions provided jointly by the USG and Organization of American States (OAS) in 1999 and 2000. The computer equipment is located at its headquarters in Montevideo, where it is very well maintained. 
<P>In 2000, post donated 10 computers and monitors, 8 printers, and two servers to the Prefectura. All of these are still in use, with the exception of one printer that has broken and is too expensive to repair. The printers are in use within the Prefectura's headquarters in Montevideo. Prefectura headquarters is preparing to distribute these computers to the Prefectura stations along Uruguay's main river and ocean port of entry. Throughout this expanded network, border officers will gain improved access to the Prefectura's database and more timely and thorough analysis of data and border crossing patterns of potential drug traffickers. Currently, only data for individuals is contained within the system. Prefectura would like to install automatic cameras at Uruguay's busiest border crossings to photograph each vehicle as it enters or exists the country. 
<P>Post purchased 10 new computers in 2002 for use in Prefectura's main headquarters and to replace the computers from 2000 that are being distributed to the border areas. These computers are primarily used to form the database's central information backbone. A Prefectura employee developed this database after post-sponsored computer courses. Post purchased scanners, digital cameras, external hard drive, modems, and other computer hardware that are strengthening the quantity and quality of information in the database as well as its accessibility to border posts. 
<P>The two computers and printer located at the Ministry of Public Health are used for precursor chemical permits and are in good condition. 
<P>The National Drug Secretariat (SND) maintains personal computers (15), fax machines (2) and printers (10). The SND received a new computer network in 2002. It is located in Montevideo and serves basic administrative tasks. 
<P>The Ministry of Public Health maintains two personal computers systems and a printer provided by the USG in 1999. 
<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>Thirteen vehicles were donated to DGRTID, including three motorcycles. Through an innovative exchange program with major car dealerships in Uruguay, the vehicles are traded in for new models every two years at virtually no charge. Through this program, vehicles have been exchanged, thus maintaining a young, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. 
<P>Post has donated three motorcycles that are not currently used extensively by the DGRTID. Two of these are in need of repairs that are prohibitively expensive. Consequently, they are not in use. The newest of these motorcycles is a 1996 Suzuki, which is large and unlike local vehicles. DGRTID could benefit from small, more common motorcycles both for reducing maintenance costs as well as for blending in with local vehicles. 
<P>The National Drug Secretariat (SND) maintains a vehicle donated by post in 1988. 
<P><B>Patrol Boats</B> 
<P>The Prefectura operates the two Cape Class patrol boats along the Uruguay River and the coast. They are in good condition. The Prefectura operates two motorized rafts out of Montevideo. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B> 
<P>Typewriters, electronic surveillance system, videocassette recorders, video cameras, photocopiers, fax machines, night vision devices, camcorders, air conditioning unit, narcotics test kits, cadaver kits, electronic scales, air conditioning units. fingerprint kits, 6 fiber optic borescopes, metal detector police assault gear, protective gear, voltage regulators, radio, transformers plus other support equipment (including desks and chairs, binoculars, flashlights and handcuffs), communication monitoring systems, bullet- proof vests, protective outerwear, UPS, weight balance, have been donated to the DRGTID and the Prefectura. 
<P>In general, the equipment is in good condition. Out-of-date electronic equipment has been replaced with newer, more useful models. The handcuffs and other police equipment could be replaced. 
<P><B>Canines</B> 
<P>A number of drug-detecting dogs are raised, trained, and housed on the DGRTID grounds in Montevideo. Currently, drug-detecting dogs from DGRTID are used in 3-4 districts. DGRTID hopes to expand their use to more areas as more litters are born and trained. The Embassy has previously donated containers that house a veterinarian's office, dog pens, and a small staff kitchen. 
<P>The Prefectura has a canine program with a relatively large number of dogs trained in drug detection. They have 9 dogs in Montevideo and another 20 at posts in the Interior, including some posts with two dogs. This year the dogs had 14 pups. Only one trainer is in charge of training a lot of the dogs. They have expressed an interest in new dog training techniques, including passive identification. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P>INL equipment has made a significant difference in the Government of Uruguay (GOU) counternarcotics effort, particularly through improved border control and tracking of persons. Computer equipment provided to the DGRTID and the Prefectura is forming comprehensive information networks that are improving data sharing between Uruguay's ports of entry and central resources in Montevideo. Without INL funding and assistance, many anti-narcotics projects would not be possible. 
<P>DGRTID records show that 1,736 individuals were arrested in 2003 for drug trafficking activities; 279 were prosecuted; and 11 are under drug addition treatment. Yearly seizures in the internal markets reached nearly 620 kg of marijuana, 42.5 kg of cocaine, 3 grams of crack, 18 grams of ecstasy, and 30 cannabis plants. DGRTID seizure records for the international market show 4 kg of cocaine and 12.1 kg of heroin. The Investigative and Drug Control Unit of the Coast Guard seized 154 g of marijuana, 215 g of coca leaf, and 7.7 g of cocaine. Overall, the amounts of drug seized and the number of individuals arrested have been increasing dramatically. 
<P>
<P><B>PARAMARIBO</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>Post conducted on-site inspections and periodic spot checks of all resources. Post also received a host government report on the materials. DEA agents visit post regularly and monitor the use and status of the vehicles, equipment and furniture. Narcotics Police, Vetted Unit, and the Police Force accommodate visits from Embassy personnel. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P>The following commodities were provided to the Government of Suriname (GOS) law enforcement agencies in 2003: fax machines; Polaroid cameras; CPU's; printers; scanners; file cabinets; office desks; office chairs; drug test kits; handcuffs; maglights; Toyota Landcruiser Station Wagon; Toyota Landcruiser pickup; Toyota Corona; copy machine; black lights for document checks; passport guides. 
<P>The following commodities were provided to the Ministry of Justice and Police Force's Special Investigative Unit (SIU) in prior years: chairs (16); tables (6); Compaq computer (1); fax machine (1); laser printer (1); cabinets (6); air conditioner (1); cellular phones (4); fingerprint kit (1); cipher locks (2); air vent fan (1); single tube night vision goggles (2); Pentium multimedia generic desktop computer (1); Toshiba lap top and a printer (1); protective vests (8). 
<P>
<P>Most of donated equipment is used by the Narcotics Brigade and the DEA-vetted unit, both of which are located at the Suriname Police complex at Nieuwe Haven. The Landcruiser vehicles are stored at the same complex and are used to travel outside Paramaribo where 4x4 vehicles are essential and regular cars cannot travel. The black lights and passport guides are used by the Narcotics Brigade and the DEA-vetted unit at Nieuwe Haven and by the Military Police, consular Section-Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Customs officials at the airport. All items are being used in accordance with their stated purpose. 
<P><B>Impact</B> 
<P>The Government of Suriname (GOS) uses all resources provided in an effective manner. The November 2003 seizure of 341 kilograms of cocaine and two airplanes is an excellent example of GOS law enforcement agencies increased efforts to interdict narcotics at locations other than the international airports. Continued INL assistance will have an extremely positive effect on the GOS's counternarcotics activities. 
<P><B>QUITO</B> 
<P>
<P><B>Procedures</B> 
<P>Post maintains regular and frequent contact with the National Police Anti-Drug Division (DNA) to allow close monitoring of donated material. Letters were sent to each supported unit with a copy of the existing inventory for their verification. The NAS completed physical verification of the commodities at Tabacundo, Ibara, Mascarillas, Tulcan, Latacunga, Ambeto, Riobamba, and Guaranda. 
<P><B>Status</B> 
<P>The information below is derived from information submitted by National Anti-Drug Police Units. NAS personnel will verify this information in the course of affixing labels to donated commodities over the next few months. The more intensive EUM activity made possible by increased staffing in 2002 revealed the loss of some commodities that had not been divulged to NAS previously. All of these items had been assigned to individual police department personnel. The cases have been referred to police administrative judges for determination of responsibility. 
<P><B>Defense Articles</B> 
<P>The Ecuadorian Army's 19th Brigade includes a Boston Whaler located in Puerto El Carmen. In addition, there are 100 HP Johnson O/B motors (19); trailers (4); Zodiac boats (4); and 40 HP Motors (4) donated by USMILGP.

<P>The DNA reported the loss or theft of 18 Beretta pistols, 4 Sig Sauer pistols and one protective (flak) vest. 
<P>The NAS donated 100 HMMWV's and 51 five-ton trucks to the Ecuadorian Army in 2003 for northern border use. One HMMWV and one truck were lost overboard during transit to Ecuador; one HMMWV was wrecked after it was transferred to the GOE. The Mission is pursuing claims against the shipper for the maritime loss. 
<P><B>Vehicles</B> 
<P>There are currently 130 cars/trucks and 66 motorcycles in the ENP inventory. Twenty-four cars/trucks and 17 motorcycles have been identified as being beyond their useful life and will be removed from inventory.

Repair and maintenance needs are evaluated by NAS personnel and the vehicles are sent to appropriate shops for the necessary work. The NAS keeps records of vehicle maintenance; maintains a tire stock; and furnishes a fixed amount of fuel for operations by the donated vehicles throughout Ecuador. 
<P><B>Vessels</B> 
<P>The two NAS-procured 17-foot Boston Whaler boats assigned to the ENP Interdiction and Rescue Group (GIR) are maintained by private contractors without NAS financial support. The boats are in excellent condition and are used by the GIR unit in Guayaquil to patrol the waterways near that city. 
<P><B>Communications Equipment</B> 
<P>The NAS has supplied the ENP with 22 repeater stations, 38 base stations, 73 mobile units, 213 portable hand-held radios (walkie-talkies), 2 manpack HF radios, and 1 HF base radio. All equipment is provided with full accessories. The equipment is distributed throughout the country. 
<P>The DNA has 16 HT-1000 and 51 Motorola Saber radios. Twenty additional saber radios are used by the NAS-supported DHS-guided Anti-Alien Smuggling Police Intelligence Unit (COAC). 
<P>The Ecuadorian Army (the 19th Jungle brigade, Coca) has 87 Manpack VHF radios, chargers and accessories that were donated in FY-2002. The equipment is currently in Quito undergoing tests. 
<P><B>Computer Equipment</B> 
<P>The NAS began a computer upgrade and standardization project with the ENP Anti-Drug Units throughout the country. Phase 1 in calendar year 2002 comprised 60 computers, 4 servers and 5 printers distributed as follows: Pichincha (32); Guayas (6); Imbabura (3); Carchi (1); Tungurahua (1); Cotopaxi (1); Chimborazo (1); Azuay (1) Loja (1); Esmeraldas (2); Los Rios (1); Manabi (3); El Oro (1); Baeza (1); Tena (1); Puyo (1); Lago Agrio (1); Coca (1); Macas (1).

<P>
<P><B>Canine Unit</B> 
<P>NAS/Ecuador has been providing technical assistance, food and supplies to the Ecuadorian National Police's Canine Training Center (CAC) located in Quito since its inception, as well as to the canine units deployed at Ecuador's major airports. The canine program has been the pride of the ENP and accounts for nearly all of the drug interdictions in Ecuador. In 2000, the NAS acquired 26 dogs locally, which were trained with their respective handlers. There are eighty-three (83) narcotics detector dogs in active service throughout the country. 
<P><B>Miscellaneous</B> 
<P>The NAS provided the DNA with five emergency generators. They are in service at the operational units. In 2002, the NAS procured 400 sets of pants, shirts, caps, reflective vests, boots, camouflage shirts, ponchos, and belts. They were distributed to operational units in the field.
