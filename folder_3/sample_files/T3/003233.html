	 <H3 CLASS="blue"><A NAME="1"></A>Introduction</H3> 
	 <P>This information about aerial photographs refers to the products of the
		National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP), an interagency Federal effort
		coordinated by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The NAPP is designed to cover
		all the lower 48 States every 5 to 7 years with a new set of aerial
		photographs. The USGS uses the photographs largely for revising its famous
		topographic maps; the U.S. Forest Service, for monitoring forest conditions;
		the Natural Resources Conservation Service, for looking at soils and land
		cover; and so on. The photographs, in fact, are helpful for a great many
		purposes -- mapmakers, land resource managers, earth scientists, life
		scientists, engineers, urban planners, and recreational users all purchase
		large numbers of these photographs. Many members of the general public also use
		them simply for a novel view of a familiar landscape, such as a park, farm, or
		recreational area. </P> 
	 <H3 CLASS="blue"><A NAME="2"></A>Aerial Photographs Available from the U.S. Geological
		Survey </H3> 
	 <P>At its EROS Data Center, near Sioux Falls, S. Dak., the USGS houses more
		than 6 million aerial photographs of the United States, some dating from the
		1940's. In addition to USGS aerial photography, the Center also holds
		photographs from other Federal agencies, bringing the entire collection to more
		than 8 million pictures. </P> 
	 <P>The earlier photographs come from a variety of programs and vary in
		scale and other ways. Aside from pure historical or nostalgic interest, they
		are useful alongside more recent images to document land-surface changes. </P> 
	 <H3 CLASS="blue"><A NAME="3"></A>NAPP in General</H3> 
	 <P>Making a map from an aerial photograph is a time-consuming process that
		involves deleting the tones, texture, and detail not needed to convey the
		themes of the map. Other information--important things such as place names--is
		added in the mapmaking process. So aerial photographs actually have more
		information of some kinds than do the maps that are made from them. But for
		most purposes, they are best used in conjunction with maps. </P> 
	 <P>Most NAPP photographs are black and white, but some are color-infrared,
		the better to show certain differences in plant life. They are shot from
		airplanes flying at a constant altitude of 20,000 feet, and each is shot
		straight down from the plane. Each 9- by 9-inch print covers an area about 5
		miles square at an approximate scale of 1:40,000, where an inch represents
		about 0.6 mile on the ground. (With enlargement, of course, the scale is
		changed, so that an 18-inch print has a scale of 1:20,000.) Each photograph is
		centered on a quarter section of a standard USGS 7.5-minute topographic map.
		</P> 
	 <P>The photographs are mostly free of clouds, and their resolution is high.
		A deer hunter, for example, couldn't spot an individual animal in the photo,
		but surely could make out a grove of a few trees along a likely looking draw.
		Using the contours on a topographic map, the deer hunter could tell the
		elevation and slope of the spot with some precision. </P> 
	 <P>Our deer hunter can also use an instrument called a stereoscope to view
		two overlapping photographs at once, rendering an image that appears to be in
		three dimensions. Inexpensive stereoscopes are readily available from
		scientific supply houses. Instructions for their use can be found in any number
		of standard texts on cartography, terrain analysis, remote sensing, and
		photointerpretation. </P> 
	 <P>Because NAPP photographs are used for cartographic and analytic
		purposes, they are always taken with sufficient overlap to create stereo pairs.
		Any buyer of the photographs who wishes to see the three-dimensional view can
		buy pairs and view them through the stereoscope. </P> 
	 <P>Aerial photographs are also available in digital form as products called
		digital orthophoto quadrangles, or <A HREF="doqbkyd.html">DOQ</A> images. DOQ's
		have the same accurate measurements of distance and direction as do maps. </P> 
	 <H3 CLASS="blue"><A NAME="4"></A>Interpreting Aerial Photographs</H3> 
	 <P>Interpreting an aerial photograph, as distinguished from merely looking
		at one, requires a little skill. People spend years becoming proficient
		photointerpreters, and the amateur or casual user of these images is wise to
		spend a few minutes learning to distinguish a small cloud shadow from a small
		lake, an air force base from a civilian airport, or a stand of young timber
		from a grassy hillside. </P> 
	 <H3 CLASS="blue"><A NAME="5"></A>What to Look For</H3> 
	 <P>Aerial photographs contain a lot of information, so different users
		examine them for different purposes. A consulting civil engineer may be looking
		for anomalies in drainage patterns, for example. A geologist may examine
		landforms to make deductions about the subsurface. A duck hunter may look for
		stock ponds that don't show up on topographic maps. So the engineer or
		geologist would use two photographs and a stereoscope, while the hunter can
		look at a single photograph unaided as he spreads it across the hood of his
		truck. In both cases, however, the users are likely to examine the photographs
		and USGS topographic maps together, perhaps alternating between the two to
		connect place names and road numbers with unidentified features in the
		photographs. </P> 
	 <H3 CLASS="blue"><A NAME="6"></A>To Obtain NAPP</H3> 
	 <P>NAPP photographs may be obtained from a selected list of USGS Business
		Partners. </P> 
	 <P>The NAPP inventory can be searched via EarthExplorer, using
		<A
		 HREF="http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/Webglis/glisbin/finder_main.pl?dataset_name=NAPP">
		Photo Finder</A>, where it is possible to place orders online. </P> 
	 <P>NAPP photographs are available as paper prints, film negatives and
		positives, and diapositives. </P>
