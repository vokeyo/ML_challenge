        <p align="left">The National Park Service's National Register of Historic 
          Places and the City of Charleston, South Carolina, proudly invite you 
          to discover <b>Historic Charleston's Religious and Community Buildings</b>. 
          Charleston sits on a narrow peninsula where the Ashley and Cooper Rivers 
          meet as they flow into the Atlantic Ocean. The community named for King 
          Charles of England was established in 1670, became the center of the 
          Carolina colony, the eighth state to join the Union, and the cultural 
          center of the antebellum South. Charleston was the destination for peoples 
          throughout Europe, Africa, and the Carribean, who have collectively 
          shaped this unique region. This National Register of Historic Places 
          Travel Itinerary explores Charleston's rich heritage using 43 historic 
          places that reflect over 300 years of history, from the early Walled 
          City of the British colony, through the prosperous growth of the shipping 
          industry and surrounding plantations, its role in the events leading 
          up to the Civil War, the resurgence of the community during the late 
          19th century, and the establishment of one of the most complete and 
          intact historic districts in the country. 
        <p> The city of Charleston is already a well-known tourist destination 
          because of its history and pioneering efforts in preservation. This 
          itinerary focuses on the variety of buildings that tell the stories 
          of its religious and community history. Numerous religious denominations 
          have been active in Charleston for centuries. Beautiful <a href="#stp">St. 
          Philip's Episcopal Church</a> was the first Anglican congregation established 
          south of Virginia. <a href="#kah">Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim</a> is the 
          country's second oldest synagogue and the birthplace of the American 
          Reform Judaism movement. The itinerary also includes less well-known 
          churches which represent the spiritual diversity that the city was built 
          upon, such as the <a href="#ema">Emanuel AME Church</a>, the oldest 
          African Methodist Episcopal church in the South, <a href="#sct">First 
          Scots Presbyterian</a>, established in 1731 by 12 Scottish families, 
          and <a href="#sma">St. Mary's</a>, the first Roman Catholic Church in 
          the Carolinas and Georgia. The majority of Charleston's public and community 
          buildings reflect a time when it was one of the wealthiest and most 
          important port cities of the colonies and young country. Major events 
          that shaped the future of the colony took place at the <a href="#exc">Exchange</a>. 
          The <a href="#mrk">Market Hall and Sheds</a> provided fresh meat and 
          produce for the same city dwellers that formed social and benevolent 
          groups such as the <a href="#ssh">South Carolina Society Hall</a> and 
          the <a href="#ger">German Friendly Society</a>. <a href="#smi">St. Michael's 
          Episcopal Church</a>, the <a href="#usp">United States Post Office</a>, 
          the <a href="#ccc">Charleston County Courthouse</a>, and <a href="#cch">Charleston 
          City Hall</a> form the city's civic center, known as the Four Corners 
          of the Law. 
        <p> <b>Historic Charleston's Religious and Community Buildings</b> offers 
          numerous ways to discover the historic properties that played important 
          roles in the establishment of Charleston's civic, cultural, and spiritual 
          community. Each property features a brief description of the site's 
          significance, color and historic photographs, and public accessibility 
          information. At the bottom of each page, the visitor will also find 
          a navigation bar containing links to three essays concerning <a href="#preservation">Charleston 
          and Preservation</a>, <a href="#architecture">Religious Architecture</a>, 
          and <a href="#community">Community History</a>. These essays provide 
          historical background, or "contexts," for many of the sites included 
          in the itinerary. The itinerary can be viewed online, or printed out 
          for use by visitors to Charleston. 
        <p> Created through a partnership between the National Park Service's 
          National Register of Historic Places, the City of Charleston's Department 
          of Planning and Urban Development, the National Conference of State 
          Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO), and the National Alliance of 
          Preservation Commissions (NAPC), <b>Historic Charleston's Religious 
          and Community Buildings</b> is the third example of a new and exciting 
          cooperative project. As part of the Department of the Interior's strategy 
          to revitalize communities by promoting public awareness of history and 
          encouraging tourists to visit historic places throughout the nation, 
          the National Register of Historic Places is cooperating with communities, 
          regions and Heritage Areas throughout the United States to create online 
          travel itineraries. Using places listed in the National Register of 
          Historic Places, the itineraries help potential visitors plan their 
          next trip by highlighting the amazing diversity of this country's historic 
          places and supplying accessibility information for each featured site. 
          In the <a href="#learnmore">Learn More</a> section, the itineraries 
          link to regional and local web sites that provide visitors with further 
          information regarding cultural events, special activities, and lodging 
          and dining possibilities. Visitors may be interested in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/cgi-bin/intercept?http://www.nationaltrust.org/historic_hotels/index.asp">Historic

          on Community History</font></i></font></font>
        <p align="left">After Charles II was restored to the English throne, he 
          granted the chartered Carolina territory to eight of his loyal friends, 
          known as the Lord Proprietors, in 1663. It took seven years before the 
          Lords could arrange for settlement, the first being that of Charles 
          Town. The community named for the King Charles I was established by 
          English settlers in 1670 across the Ashley River from the city's current 
          location. It was soon chosen by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, one of the Lord 
          Proprietors, to become a "great port towne," a destiny which the city 
          fulfilled. By 1680, the settlement had grown, joined by others from 
          England, Barbados, and Virginia, and relocated to its current peninsular 
          location. The capital of the Carolina colony, Charleston was the center 
          for further expansion and the southernmost point of English settlement 
          during the late 1600s. 
        <p> The settlement was often subject to attack from sea and from land. 
          Periodic assaults from Spain and France, who still contested England's 
          claims to the region, were combined with resistance from American Indians 
          as well as pirate raids. Charleston's colonists erected a fortification 
          wall around the small settlement to aid in its defense. The only building 
          to remain from the Walled City is the <a href="#pow">Powder Magazine</a>, 
          where the city's supply of gun powder was stored. 
        <p> 
        A 1680 plan for the new settlement, the Grand Modell, laid out "the model 
        of an exact regular town," and the future for the growing community. Land 
        surrounding the intersection of Meeting and Broad Streets was set aside 
        for a Civic Square. Over time it became known as the Four Corners of the 
        Law, referring to the various arms of governmental and religious law presiding 
        over the square and the growing city. <a href="#smi"> St. Michael's Episcopal</a>, 
        Charleston's oldest and most noted church, was built on the southeast 
        corner in 1752. The following year the <a href="#ccc">Capitol</a> of the 
        colony was erected across the square. Because of its prominent position 
        within the city and its elegant architecture, the building signaled to 
        Charleston's citizens and visitors its importance within the British colonies. 
        Provincial court met on the ground floor, the Commons House of Assembly 
        and the Royal Governor's Council Chamber met on the second floor. 
        <p> While the earliest settlers primarily came from England, colonial 
          Charleston was also home to a mixture of ethnic and religious groups. 
          French, Scottish, Irish and Germans migrated to the developing seacoast 
          town, representing numerous Protestant denominations, as well as Catholicism 
          and Judaism. Sephardic Jews (of Spanish and Portugese ancestry) migrated 
          to the city in such numbers that Charleston became one of the largest 
          Jewish communities in North America. The Jewish <a href="#cem">Coming 
          Street Cemetery</a>, first established in 1762, attests to their long 
          standing presence in the community. The first Anglican church, <a href="#stp">St. 
          Philip's Episcopal</a>, was built in 1682, although later destroyed 
          by fire and relocated to its current location. Slaves also comprised 
          a major portion of the population, and were active in the city's religious 
          community. Free black Charlestonians and slaves helped establish the 
          <a href="#obm">Old Bethel United Methodist Church</a> in 1797, and the 
          congregation of the <a href="#ema">Emanuel A.M.E. Church</a> stems from 
          a religious group organized solely by African Americans, free and slave, 
          in 1791. 
        <p> 
        By the mid-18th century Charleston had become a bustling trade center, 
        and the wealthiest and largest city south of Philadelphia. Rice and indigo 
        had been successfully cultivated by gentleman planters in the surrounding 
        coastal lowcountry, while merchants profited from the successful shipping 
        industry. As the relationship between the colonists and England deteriorated, 
        Charleston became a focal point in the ensuing Revolution. In protest 
        of the Tea Act of 1773, which embodied the concept of "taxation without 
        representation," Charlestonians confiscated tea and stored it in the <a href="#exc">Exchange 
        and Custom House</a>. Representatives from all over the colony came to 
        the Exchange in 1774 to elect delegates to the Continental Congress, the 
        group responsible for drafting the Declaration of Independence; and South 
        Carolina declared its independence from the crown on the steps of the 
        Exchange. Soon, the church steeples of Charleston, especially St. Michael's, 
        became targets for British war ships. A siege on the city in 1776 was 
        successfully defended by <a href="#sum">William Moultrie</a> from Sullivan's 
        Island, but by 1780 Charleston came under British control for two and 
        a half years. After the British retreated in December 1782, the city's 
        name was officially changed to Charleston. By 1788, Carolinians were meeting 
        at the <a href="#ccc">Capitol</a> building for the Constitutional Ratification 
        Convention, and while there was support for the Federal Government, division 
        arose over the location of the new State Capital. A suspicious fire broke 
        out in the Capitol building during the Convention, after which the delegates 
        removed to the <a href="#exc">Exchange</a> and decreed Columbia the new 
        State Capital. By 1792, the Capitol had been rebuilt and became the Charleston 
        County Courthouse. Upon its completion, the city possessed all the public 
        buildings necessary to be transformed from a colonial capital to the center 
        of the antebellum South. But the grandeur and number of buildings erected 
        in the following century reflect the optimism, pride, and civic destiny 
        that many Charlestonians felt for their community. 
        <p> 
        As Charleston grew, so did the community's cultural and social opportunities, 
        especially for the elite merchants and planters. The first theater building 
        in America was built in Charleston in 1736, but was later replaced by 
        the 19th-century Planter's Hotel where wealthy planters stayed during 
        Charleston's horse-racing season (now the <a href="#doc">Dock Street Theatre</a>). 
        Benevolent societies were formed by several different ethnic groups: the 
        <a href="#ssh">South Carolina Society</a>, founded by French Huguenots 
        in 1737; the <a href="#ger">German Friendly Society</a>, founded in 1766; 
        and the <a href="#hib">Hibernian Society</a>, founded by Irish immigrants 
        in 1801. The <a href="#cls">Charleston Library Society</a> was established 
        in 1748 by some wealthy Charlestonians who wished to keep up with the 
        scientific and philosophical issues of the day. This group also helped 
        establish the <a href="#col">College of Charleston</a> in 1770, the oldest 
        college in South Carolina and the 13th college in the United States. 
        <p> Charleston became more prosperous in the plantation dominated economy 
          of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 
          1793 revolutionized this crop's production, and it quickly became South 
          Carolina's major export. Cotton plantations relied heavily on slave 
          labor. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working 
          as domestics, artisans, market workers or laborers. Many black Charlestonians 
          spoke Gullah, a dialect based on African American structures which combined 
          African, Portuguese, and English words. By 1820 Charleston's population 
          had grown to 23,000, with a black majority. When a massive slave revolt 
          planned by Denmark Vesey, a free black, was discovered in 1822, such 
          hysteria ensued amidst white Charlestonians and Carolinians that the 
          activities of free blacks and slaves were severely restricted. Hundreds 
          of blacks, free and slave, and some white supporters involved in the 
          planned uprising were held in the <a href="#old">Old Jail</a>. It also 
          was the impetus for the construction of a new <a href="#ssa">State Arsenal</a> 
          in Charleston. 
        <p> 
        As Charleston's government, society and industry grew, commercial institutions 
        were established to support the community's aspirations. The <a href="#cit">Bank 
        of South Carolina</a>, the second oldest building constructed as a bank 
        in the nation, was established here in 1798. Branches of the First and 
        Second Bank of the United States were also located in Charleston in 1800 
        and 1817. While the First Bank was converted to <a href="#cch">City Hall</a> 
        by 1818, the <a href="#sbc">Second Bank</a> proved to be a vital part 
        of the community as it was the only bank in the city equipped to handle 
        the international transactions so crucial to the export trade. By 1840, 
        the <a href="#mrk">Market Hall and Sheds</a>, where fresh meat and produce 
        were brought daily, became the commercial hub of the city. The slave trade 
        also depended on the port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded 
        and the slaves sold at <a href="#osm">markets</a>. 
        <p> In the first half of the 19th century, South Carolinians became more 
          devoted to the idea that state's rights were superior to the Federal 
          government's authority. Buildings such as the <a href="#omh">Marine 
          Hospital</a> ignited controversy over the degree in which the Federal 
          government should be involved in South Carolina's government, society, 
          and commerce. During this period over 90 percent of Federal funding 
          was generated from import duties, collected by custom houses such as 
          the one in Charleston. In 1832 South Carolina passed an ordinance of 
          nullification, a procedure in which a state could in effect repeal a 
          Federal law, directed against the most recent tariff acts. Soon Federal 
          soldiers were dispensed to Charleston's forts and began to collect tariffs 
          by force. A compromise was reached by which the tariffs would be gradually 
          reduced, but the underlying argument over state's rights would continue 
          to escalate in the coming decades. Charleston remained one of the busiest 
          port cities in the country, and the construction of a new, larger <a href="#usc">United 
          States Custom House</a> began in 1849, but its construction was interrupted 
          by the events of the Civil War.
        <p> 
        In 1860, the National Democratic Convention convened in Charleston. <a href="#hib">Hibernian 
        Hall</a> served as the headquarters for the delegates supporting Stephen 
        A. Douglas, who it was hoped would bridge the gap between the northern 
        and southern delegates on the issue of extending slavery to the territories. 
        The convention disintegrated when delegates were unable to summon a two-thirds 
        majority for any candidate. This divisiveness resulted in a split in the 
        Democratic party, and the election of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican 
        candidate. On December 20, 1860, the South Carolina legislature was the 
        first state to vote for secession from the Union. They asserted that one 
        of the causes was the election to the presidency of a man "whose opinions 
        and purposes are hostile to slavery."

        On January 9, 1861, <a href="#ssa">Citadel</a> cadets fired the first 
        shots of the Civil War when they opened fire on a Union ship entering 
        Charleston's harbor. April 2, 1861, shore batteries under the command 
        of General Pierre G. T. Beauregard opened fire on the Union-held <a href="#sum">Fort 
        Sumter</a> in the harbor. After a 34-hour bombardment, Major Robert Anderson 
        surrendered the fort. Cadets from the Citadel, South Carolina's liberal 
        arts military college, continued to aid the Confederate army by helping 
        drill recruits, manufacture ammunition, protect arms depots, and guard 
        Union prisoners. The city under siege took control of Fort Sumter, became 
        the center for blockade running, and was the site of the first submarine 
        warfare in 1863. In 1865, Union troops moved into the city, and took control 
        of many sites, such as the <a href="#por">United States Arsenal</a> which 
        the Confederate army had seized at the outbreak of the war. 
        <p> 
        After the eventual and destructive defeat of the Confederacy, Federal 
        forces remained in Charleston during the city's reconstruction. The war 
        had shattered the prosperity of the antebellum city. Freed slaves were 
        faced with poverty and discrimination. Industries slowly brought the city 
        and its inhabitants back to a renewed vitality and growth in population. 
        As the city's commerce improved, Charlestonians also worked to restore 
        their community institutions. In 1867 Charleston's first free secondary 
        school for blacks was established, the <a href="#ave">Avery Institute</a>. 
        General William T. Sherman lent his support to the conversion of the United 
        States Arsenal into the <a href="#por">Porter Military Academy</a>, an 
        educational facility for former soldiers and boys left orphaned or destitute 
        by the war. The <a href="#ens">William Enston Home</a>, a planned community 
        for the city's aged and infirm, was built in 1889. An elaborate public 
        building, the <a href="#usp">United States Post Office and Courthouse</a>, 
        was completed in 1896 and signaled renewed life in the heart of the city. 
        <p> In 1886 Charleston was nearly destroyed by a major earthquake that 
          was felt as far away as Boston and Bermuda. Few buildings escaped damage. 
          Coupled with fires, hurricanes, tornados, several wars, and urban renewal 
          in the 20th century, it is extraordinary how many of Charleston's historic 
          buildings remain. Today the city's community buildings help to make 
          Charleston one of the most complete historic districts in the country, 
          with more than 1400 historically significant buildings.

          on Religious Architecture</font></i></font></font>
        <p align="left">Charleston's church architecture, like the city's architecture 
          in general, is overwhelmingly of English derivation, as might be expected 
          in an English colonial establishment which has been referred to as a 
          "Little London."
        <p> <b>Georgian Palladian</b>
        <p> During the Colonial era the prevailing architecture was English Georgian, 
          which was founded securely on the work of the late Italian Renaissance 
          architect Andrea Palladio, as interpreted by Indigo Jones and subsequent 
          English architects. In church building, the translation of Palladio's 
          influence came through the designs of Christopher Wren and James Gibbs.
        <p> Although South Carolina's religious freedom (for all non-Catholics) 
          attracted many Dissenters, the Church of England was the established 
          church after 1706. Even before that, the '"English Church" was dominant> 
          and ' its houses of worship were public buildings. The first structure 
          of St. Philip's Church, the first Anglican parish, was erected in 1681-82 
          at the southeast comer of the Meeting and Broad Streets, the site now 
          occupied by <a href="#smi">St. Michael's Church</a>. John Oldmixon wrote 
          in 1708 that it was "large and stately enough," and the "most remarkable" 
          of the town's public buildings. It was built of black cypress upon a 
          brick foundation.
        <p> The intriguing question is whether or not this first "English Church" 
          had a tall pointed steeple inspired by Wren's steepled churches in London, 
          built after the Great Fire of 1666. The Gothic steeple had been in disfavor, 
          due to the influence of the Italian Renaissance, until it was revived 
          by Wren and classicized through the use of arches, pilasters and other 
          devices. It is not impossible that the first St. Philip's had such a 
          classicized steeple. On the other hand, the Congregational, Anabaptist 
          and French Calvinist churches and the Quaker Meeting House, all of which 
          were built about the same time, were simple, steepleless structures, 
          more a tribute to the Lords Proprietors' guarantee of liberty of conscience 
          than to the architectural aspirations of their congregations.
        <p> 
        Colonial Charleston was the wealthiest of English cities in America, and 
        the city's elite maintained close ties with London. That a sophisticated 
        taste in architecture was present early in Charleston was illustrated 
        by the second St. Philip's Church, built in 1710-23. The brick church 
        featured not only a steeple but also three monumental Roman Doric porticoes, 
        depicted in an illustration from London's <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> 
        in 1753. The steeple, a polygonal tower topped by a polygonal lantern, 
        dome and cupola, perhaps was based on the steeple of Wren's St. Magnus 
        the Martyr, London, or on that of St. Ignatius, the Jesuit church at Antwerp. 
        <p> St. Philip's undoubtedly was the most sophisticated church building 
          in the English colonies when it was built. It antedated Christ Church 
          in Philadelphia, which was the second church in America to use an applied 
          order, and Peter Harrison's King's Chapel in Boston, the second church 
          for which a giant order portico was designed. The English aesthete Edmund 
          Burke later described St. Philip's as "spacious, and executed in a very 
          handsome taste, exceeding everything of that kind which we have in America." 
          The proud new edifice was sited to protrude into Church Street, so that 
          the tower and porticoes provided a terminus to the vista. The siting 
          of the church as a vistal terminus reflected a Baroque city planning 
          concept, prototypes of which included similar building sitings in some 
          of the plans for rebuilding the City of London after the Great Fire 
          of 1666.
        <p> The taste for Palladian and Wren-Gibbs design outlasted the Colonial 
          era, and Charleston's conservatism in that regard triumphed in the rebuilding 
          of St. Philip's Church following a fire in 1835. During a debate on 
          the design of the replacement structure, the view was expressed that 
          Charleston's older buildings were superior, in design and construction, 
          to those in the newer 19th century styles. As a result, St. Philip's 
          vestry insisted that architect Edward Hyde rebuild the Georgian church 
          exactly as it had been before the fire, Hyde acceded to their request 
          except for minor changes on the exterior, but persuaded them to let 
          him model the new interior after that of James Gibbs' St, Martin's-in-the-Fields. 
          A decade later, the vestry commissioned architect Edward Brickell White 
          to design the present steeple, in the Wren-Gibbs tradition.
        <p> 
        The third <a href="#stp">St. Philip's</a> might be considered anticipatory 
        of the Colonial Revival movement of the late 19th century, if it were 
        not for the motivation of the conservative vestry and congregation. Their 
        goal was not to revive the architecture of the past, which would have 
        been an innovative step, but to continue it. Therefore St. Philip's has 
        to be cited as a rare instance of "Georgian Survival." 
        <p> White's 1849 steeple for St. Philip's did not replicate its domed 
          predecessor but was consciously patterned after, and made intentionally 
          higher than, the steeple of St. Michael's Church.
        <p> <a href="#smi">St. Michael's Church</a> remains Charleston's oldest 
          church edifice. An Irish architect, Samuel Cardy, built and largely 
          designed St. Michael's Church, erected in 1751-61 on the site of the 
          first St. Philip's, at the southeast corner of Broad and Meeting streets. 
          Like St. Philip's, St. Michael's exemplifies the Wren-Gibbs tradition 
          of American Colonial church building. Like many Colonial churches of 
          the period, it was inspired by James Gibbs' design for St. Martin-in-the-Fields, 
          London, c. 1726, and many of its details are reminiscent of plates from 
          Gibbs' <i>A Book of Architecture</i>, published in 1728.
        <p> The initial design of St. Michael's was by a Mr. Gibson (possibly 
          Robert Gibson, Sr). However, Cardy, who became involved in the project 
          after construction had begun, significantly altered the original plan. 
          Cardy was responsible for the remarkable ceiling, which spans some 60 
          feet without visible support, being carried on hidden trusses. In that 
          feature, St. Michael's recalls churches of Sir Nicholas Hawksmoor, such 
          as St. Alfege's, Greenwich (1713-18), rather than St. Martin's, which 
          has arches on columns supporting the ceiling (and which provided the 
          model for the interior of the third St. Philip's, as noted above). 
        <p> Cardy also contributed the steeple, which has three octagonal upper 
          tiers over a square tower. Cardy solved the problem of supporting the 
          diagonal faces of the octagon over the voids at the comers of the square, 
          by carrying them on corbelled brick half arches, known as "squinches," 
          which span the corners of the square.
        <p><b>Robert Mills</b>
        <p> America's first native-born professional architect, the Charlestonian 
          Robert Mills, designed for several Charleston congregations. MiIls had 
          a varied architectural background. He studied under James Hoban, a Palladian 
          traditionalist who was the architect of the White House; he was a protegee 
          of Thomas Jefferson, who defined his own style at Monticello; and he 
          worked under Benjamin Henry Latrobe, who brought Rational Neoclassicism 
          from Europe to America. The latter was based on the <i>philosophe</i> 
          Laugier's <i>Essai sur architecture</i>, in which he advocated a more 
          functional approach to classical architecture, anticipating Louis Sullivan 
          and the Beaux Arts. Although French in origin, the Rational Neoclassical 
          in America was based mainly on the English version, as evoked by Sir 
          John Soane and George Dance, whose work was studied by Latrobe, Mills 
          developed a distinctive Millsian style, a robust and geometric form 
          of Rational Neoclassicism, but the influence of all his teachers is 
          evident in his buildings as well, including the more conservative elements.
        <p> 
        Mills' first major contribution to Charleston architecture was the design 
        of the <a href="#cir">Circular Congregational Church</a>, built in 1804-06, 
        which was the first Pantheon-like church in America. In the Circular Church 
        he employed a dome of laminated ribs, such as was found in Jefferson's 
        copy of Philibert Delorme's <i>Invention pur batir les couvertures courbes</i>, 
        and which Jefferson had used in the dome at Monticello. Afterwards, Mills 
        used the Delorme system in round and octagonal churches in Richmond and 
        Baltimore. 
        <p> Mills' plans for the Circular Congregational Church included a portico 
          of stolid Doric columns, and no steeple, reflecting the Rational Neoclassicist 
          influence of his mentor, Latrobe. His plans were altered by the building 
          committee, which substituted Corinthian columns attenuated in the then-current 
          Adamesque taste, and subsequently the portico was replaced with a more 
          elaborate one, designed by the Charleston firm of Jones & Lee in the 
          1850s. Similarly, the church engaged Charles Reichardt in 1838 to add 
          a Wren-Gibbs steeple. Reflecting the "Georgian Survival" trend noted 
          previously at St. Philip's, Reichardt patterned the steeple closely 
          after that of St. Michael's.
        <p> The changes made the church unrecognizable as a Mills building. The 
          original Mills design became suggestible again only after the great 
          fire of 1861 reduced the church to a brick skeleton, In rebuilding in 
          the 1890s, the Congregationalists kept the circular concept, but it 
          was reinterpreted in the then-fashionable Richardsonian Romanesque style. 
        <p> 
        Mills may also have designed the <a href="#sct">First Scots Presbyterian 
        Church</a>, built in 1814. The architect of the church has not been identified, 
        but Mills' family were members of the congregation. The facade of the 
        church features twin towers capped by domes, flanking a partially recessed 
        portico. This scheme is reminiscent of Latrobe's design for St. Mary's 
        Cathedral in Baltimore, which anteceded First Scots Presbyterian by just 
        a few years. It should be noted that James and John Gordon, builders and 
        designers of the Second Presbyterian Church and St. Paul's, Radcliffeboro 
        (see below) also were members of First Scots Presbyterian. 
        <p> Mills was especially proud of his design for the <a href="#bap">First 
          Baptist Church</a> in Charleston, built ca. 1818. He described it as 
          "purely Grecian in its style, simply grand in its proportions, and beautiful 
          in its detail." The superlatives are true, except the building is not 
          "purely Greek." The portico, with its Roman Doric columns, is more Palladian-Georgian 
          than Greek Revival. The portico is not an integral component, as is 
          the portico of a Classical temple, but is appendaged to the rectangular 
          body of the church in the Wren-Gibbs tradition. The use of two tiers 
          of arched windows along the sides also constitutes a continuation of 
          Georgian tradition. Such conservative features may reflect the lingering 
          influence of his early training under Hoban. 
        <p> However, newer Rational Neoclassical concepts are revealed in the 
          simplification of ornament, the differentiation of the parts of the 
          building -- portico, vestibule, auditorium -- and in the massy, windowless 
          attic, reminiscent of the work of the French Rational Neoclassicist, 
          Claude-Nicholas Ledoux, as well as some work of Latrobe. The church 
          formerly had a domed cupola, as well, reminiscent of Latrobe's design 
          for St. Paul's in Washington, built in 1815.
        <p><b>Jeffersonian Classicism</b>
        <p> Mills' mentor Thomas Jefferson developed his own style in his Virginia 
          buildings, characterized by Roman Doric porticoes and arched openings, 
          and fanlights everywhere, including the pediment of the portico. Two 
          Charleston churches, Second Presbyterian and St. Paul's, Radcliffeboro 
          (the latter now the Cathedral of St. Luke and St.Paul), are in this 
          style. Both were designed and built by the Gordon brothers, James and 
          John, ca. 1809-1811. Both also developed structural problems in their 
          towers, so that their steeples were never completed. Second Presbyterian's 
          tower was capped by a simple lantern, while that of St. Paul's was topped 
          off, incongruously, by a Gothic parapet.
        <p><b>Greek Revival</b>
        <p> The first of the popular 19th century eclectic styles to arrive in 
          Charleston was the academic Greek Revival, which was based on a study 
          of the temple architecture of classical Greece. There had been little 
          interest in Greek architecture, since the Italian Renaissance chauvinistically 
          based its architecture on Roman models which were considered superior 
          to their Greek prototypes. Interest in Greek forms was stimulated in 
          the mid-18th century by scholarly expeditions to Greece and by the publication 
          of works such as <i>The Antiquities of Athens</i>, containing on-site 
          drawings of classical Greek ruins by the English architects Nicholas 
          Revett and James Stuart. The architects of the academic Greek Revival 
          movement sought to design modern buildings using authentic Greek elements 
          of design, gleaned from the study of prototypes in Greece and the eastern 
          Mediterranean.
        <p> In Charleston's church architecture the Greek Revival had a flowering 
          after the great fire of 1838. The fire reduced to rubble a large part 
          of the King and Meeting streets commercial area, and most of Ansonborough, 
          a residential neighborhood. The fire, though tragic, nevertheless provided 
          a unique opportunity for the Greek Revival. The majority of structures 
          built in the burnt district during the years after the fire were in 
          that style, and the neighborhood is sprinkled liberally with temple-form 
          buildings.
        <p> One of the new churches in the "burnt district" was the Doric temple 
          Second Baptist Church (now the Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church), 
          built in 1842. It was designed by Edward Brickell White, the local architect 
          most identified with the Greek Revival. White felt obliged to defend 
          his design after the church authorities altered his plans to place two 
          additional doors in the facade, behind columns. This, he pointed out, 
          was a departure from precedents in Greek temple design. 
        <p> One of the most beautiful of the Greek temple-form houses of worship 
          in the "burnt district" is Temple <a href="#kah">Beth Elohim</a>, built 
          -in 1840-41. It was designed for the Reform Jewish congregation by a 
          New York architect, Cyrus Warner. The academicists would have protested 
          that, while its massive fluted Doric columns are authentic, the spacing 
          of the triglyphs, and metopes in the entablature is more Georgian than 
          Greek, and the ceding of the sanctuary has an ornamental saucer dome, 
          which, while gorgeous, is more Roman than Greek. However, those not 
          hemmed by 19th century academic constraints will agree that, although 
          the ensemble is not "purely Greek," the result is superb.
        <p><b>Gothic Revival</b>
        <p> The Gothic Revival movement was based on an earnest theological justification 
          for the Gothic as the most proper Christian architecture. The intellectual 
          foundation of this "Ethical Gothic" premise was established in the writings 
          of the British architect Augustus Northmore Welby Pugin, whose conversion 
          to Roman Catholicism guided him to a desire to revive England's medieval 
          Catholic architecture. His ideas were presented in his influential works, 
          <i>Contrasts, or a Parallel between the Noble Edifices of the Fourteenth 
          and Fifteenth Centuries and Similar Buildings of the Present Day</i>, 
          published in 183 6, and <i>The True Principles of Pointed or Christian 
          Architecture</i>, published in 1841. Pugin's ideals evoked a response 
          among Protestants as well, as they paralleled the ideas of reformers 
          within the Church of England and the Anglican academic community. John 
          Henry Newman and others began in 1833 the Oxford Movement which sought 
          to restore ritual and liturgical richness to the Church of England. 
          The Cambridge Camden Society (later known as the Ecclesiological Society) 
          was formed at Oxford in 1836 by scholars with a common interest in medieval 
          Christian architecture, who advocated through their publication, <i>The 
          Ecclesiologist</i>. For that reason, the Ethical Gothic is also known 
          as the Ecclesiological Gothic.
        <p> In the United States, the British born architect, Richard Upjohn, 
          was a subscriber to <i>The Ecclesiologist</i>. His Trinity Church in 
          New York, 1839-1841, had no galleries (which the Ecclesiologists condemned) 
          and introduced a raised altar, an extended chancel and a cross-topped 
          spire (all of which they promoted). The church was built of stone (which 
          they advocated) but the interior vaulting was not executed in stone, 
          but simulated in lath and plaster (of which neither the Ecclesiologists, 
          nor Pugin would have approved). 
        <p> 
        Charleston architect Edward Brickell White made a "visit [to] the Northern 
        Cities, on professional, calls," in 1842, when Upjohn's Trinity Church 
        was under construction. Subsequently, he designed the <a href="#fre">Huguenot 
        Church</a>, built in 1844-45. The Huguenot Church was praised locally 
        as "the only specimen of pointed, or emphatically Christian Church Architecture, 
        which has ever been erected in our city." The language indicates a knowledge 
        of Pugin's works, and the design indicates possible direct references 
        to them. In the use of materials, the church owes no allegiance to Pugin 
        or <i>The Ecclesiologist</i>. The crockets and finials, tracery of the 
        principal window, and dripstones are all of cast iron, and the vaulting 
        inside is simulated in lath and plaster. The church is unusual in that 
        it has no tower and spire. It is a simple rectangle with a tent-like roof. 
        <p> White became South Carolina's foremost Goth, designing Gothic churches, 
          including Grace Church in Wentworth Street, and other structures in 
          Charleston and elsewhere. Grace follows Ethical strictures in having 
          no galleries and is topped by a graceful steeple. However, White employed 
          no stone; the materials, like those of the Huguenot Church, were stuccoed 
          brick, lath and plaster, and cast iron. In the 1970s, White's cast iron 
          crockets, having deteriorated in Charleston's damp climate, were replicated 
          in fiberglass.
        <p> 
        The Ethical Gothic fervor inevitably faded, but interest in the Gothic 
        continued. The later Gothic Revival drew inspiration from periods other 
        than the "Middle Pointed" promoted by Pugin and the Ecclesiologists as 
        the ideal. When Francis D. Lee Gothicized the late 18th century structure 
        of the <a href="#uni">Unitarian Church</a> in 1852-54, he employed the 
        late Gothic of the Tudor period, which the Ethicists had considered debased. 
        Lee gave the church a handsome perpendicular tower, and a magnificent 
        fan-vaulted ceiling, the latter inspired perhaps by ceilings of the Henry 
        VII Chapel at Westminster and the cloisters at Gloucester. Lee designed 
        a similar ceiling for St. Luke's Church (now the Fourth Tabernacle Baptist 
        Church), ca. 1859. 
        <p> The Brooklyn, New York, based Patrick Charles Keely, an Irish-born 
          architect, designed literally hundreds of Catholic churchs in the United 
          States, including three in Charleston. Keely claimed to have been a 
          student of Pugin, England's premier Gothicist. In the 1850s Keely designed 
          the Cathedral of St. Finbar, which was lost in the great fire of 1861, 
          as well as its successor on the same site, the Cathedral of St. John 
          the Baptist, begun after the 1886 earthquake. The two cathedrals followed 
          the Ethical requirement to be built of stone (Connecticut brownstone) 
          in emulation of the medieval prototypes, and manifested similar but 
          differing versions of Gothic design. Keely also designed the Gothic 
          Revival edifice of St. Patrick's Church, built 1886-87.
        <p> John Henry Devereux, the most prolific architect of the post-Civil 
          War era, designed two Gothic Revival churches in the city. <a href="#smt">St. 
          Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church</a>, built in 1867-71, 
          originally was polychromed, its stuccoed surface scored and overlayed 
          with paint, mixed with sand, 
        <p>to simulate blocks of different colored stone. That colorful scheme 
          reflected the influence of the English aesthete John Ruskin, who in 
          works such as <i>The Stones of Venice</i>, advocated the use of polychromed 
          stone in church architecture.</p>
        <p><b>Romanesque Revival</b> </p>
        <p> Another popular 19th century style for church buildings was the Romanesque 
          Revival. The style was derived from earlier medieval church architecture, 
          before the rise of the Gothic, and is distinguished from the latter 
          mainly in the use of round, rather than pointed, arches.
        <p> The firm of Jones & Lee (Edward C. Jones and Francis D. Lee) of Charleston 
          designed the Citadel Square Baptist Church in 1855-56, employing the 
          Norman mode of the Romanesque Revival style for the edifice.
        <p> The design of Citadel Square Baptist deviated from the model by the 
          use of a steeple (Romanesque churches had bell towers, whereas the steeple 
          spire was a Gothic innovation). The steeple was blown over by a hurricane and the tower was damaged by an earthquake. 
          The tower was repaired and given a lower steeple, designed by Edward 
          Silloway, a Boston architect. Silloway's steeple was lost in a hurricane 
          (Hugo) in 1989, and replaced by a new steeple along the lines of the 
          original, design by Jones & Lee.
        <p><b>Richardsonian Romanesque</b>
        <p>The Romanesque Revival of the antebellum period was based mainly on 
          examples in Northwestern Europe. In the late 19th century, another version 
          of the Romanesque was developed by the Boston architect, Henry Hobson 
          Richardson, based on churches of Provence and Spain. Used for the first 
          time in the 1870s in his Trinity Church, Boston, the Richardsonian Romanesque 
          became widely popular in the ensuing decades. Charleston's best Richardsonian 
          Romanesque building is the <a href="#cir">Circular Congregational Church</a>, 
          built in the 1890s to replaced Mills' burned predecessor. Designed by 
          the firm of Stevenson and Green, it features as massive central tower, 
          somewhat reminiscent of Richardson's Trinity Church. Although the "Circular" 
          remains part of the name, the present structure is not really circular 
          but tri-apsidal.</p>

          and Preservation</font></i></font></font>
        <p align="left">It is no accident that Charleston, South Carolina, is 
          a locus for the modern preservation movement. For nearly 100 years, 
          generations of Charlestonians have been aware of this city's singular 
          sense of place. Since the turn of the 20th century, individuals, organizations, 
          and government have established and promoted a preservation ethic. The 
          roots of preservation run deep. In 1783, Charleston established itself 
          as a municipal government with the motto: "She guards her customs, buildings 
          and laws." Early on Charleston embraced one extremely important notion 
          of what a city should be: guardian of its cultural, physical and social 
          structures.
        <p> Charleston's unique environment, people, and circumstances contributed 
          to a tradition of preserving and protecting the physical evidence of 
          past generations. Over the past century, Charlestonians have moved from 
          saving individual buildings to entire neighborhoods to maintain the 
          city's unique sense of place.
        <p> <b>1900 - 1930: PRESERVATION AS NATIONALISM</b> 
        <p> Early preservation efforts had a specific ideological motivation: 
          saving the city's remaining colonial era structures for educational 
          purposes. In the early 1900s, Charlestonians like other Americans shared 
          a growing interest in the beginnings of the country. This rise of nationalism 
          is best represented by the efforts of the National Society of Colonial 
          Dames and its sister organization, the Daughters of the American Revolution 
          (DAR). Charleston's local chapters took up the charge of stimulating 
          interest and pride in the nation through the preservation of the city's 
          earliest buildings. In 1902 the Colonial Dames acquired the pre-revolutionary 
          <a href="#pow">Powder Magazine</a>, one of the oldest remaining structures 
          associated with the permanent settlement of Charleston of 1680. Meanwhile, 
          the DAR acquired the <a href="#exc">Old Exchange</a> one of the city's 
          most prominent buildings, from the federal government. The motivation 
          in both cases was the same: to acquire and preserve those buildings 
          associated with past events which would physically reflect Charleston's 
          contribution to the development of the nation. 
        <p> The most notable individual of the time was a real estate agent, Susan 
          Pringle Frost. For nearly nine years she worked independently to save 
          historic residences in the city. She gathered a group of like-minded 
          citizens, and in 1920 the Society for the Preservation of Old Dwellings 
          was formally established.
        <p> 
        In the 1920s, supported by the United States Supreme Court <i>Euclid</i> 
        decision which held zoning as a valid municipal police power, cities began 
        to enact local laws regulating property use. In Charleston the city council 
        established a Special Committee on Zoning to draft an ordinance to prohibit 
        specific uses south of Broad Street, then perceived as the city's heaviest 
        concentration of important historic buildings. Upon adoption of the ordinance, 
        the special committee was permanently established as the Committee on 
        Planning and Zoning, now known as the planning and zoning commission. 
        The use of zoning regulations specifying a city's historic significance 
        and the importance of protection set the standard for hundreds of cities. 
        <p> <b>1931-1966: FORMALIZATION OF AN ETHIC</b> 
        <p> In the next 35 years, historic preservation became a formal, institutionalized 
          ethic. The Society continued to stimulate interest in the preservation 
          of historically important buildings and encourage private sector involvement 
          in the preservation of individual structures. Existing civic and newly 
          formed nonprofit organizations focused on increased awareness of good 
          planning and preservation principles; and on securing buildings from 
          inappropriate development through outright ownership. Their efforts, 
          combined with the infusion of preservation objectives into government 
          regulations, would make a significant impact on the city and set an 
          example for the nation.
        <p> The work initiated in 1929 by the Special Committee on Zoning resulted 
          in the hiring of a planning consultant, Morris Knowles, from Pittsburgh, 
          Pa. Knowles conducted a survey with the assistance of Albert Simons 
          which identified a relatively small but extremely important area of 
          18th-century buildings. His work also took into account a variety of 
          planning issues relating to parks, schools and land utilization. Ultimately 
          this work formed the basis for a city plan and zoning ordinance. Although 
          the plan was never adopted, the city council did ratify the proposed 
          <i>(historic district)</i> zoning ordinance on October 13, 1931. The 
          opening sentence of the ordinance clearly stated its purpose: "In order 
          to promote general welfare through the preservation and protection of 
          historic places and areas of historic interest...", leaving no doubt 
          as to the city's intention. For the first time groups or areas of buildings 
          were designated as significant and worthy of protection. The blending 
          of planning and preservation goals was unique and a revolutionary concept 
          for its time.
        <p> The city council also created the Board of Architectural view (BAR) 
          and the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Although the powers of the review 
          board were limited to reviewing demolition requests within the area 
          specified, the formal plan submission and review procedures opened an 
          avenue for negotiation which heretofore never existed. The board's role 
          was that of a negotiator, working with applicants to find mutually acceptable 
          solutions to design problems. During the late 1930s Charleston utilized 
          federal sources of money for preservation purposes. In 1938 when a tornado 
          struck, federal assistance was used to mitigate the damage to historic 
          structures. The city also used available federal funding under Roosevelt's 
          New Deal to provide public housing. In 1939 the city razed a number 
          of dilapidated buildings outside the historic district defined by the 
          1931 ordinance. The most valuable antebellum structures were saved and 
          incorporated into the new multi-family housing project. Although this 
          was the only time the Housing Authority of Charleston restored historic 
          buildings for housing, in subsequent years it rehabilitated the <a href="#omh">Marine 
          Hospital</a> (1833) by Robert Mills and the adjacent <a href="#old">City 
          Jail</a> for administrative functions.
        <p> 
        As community interest in historic preservation grew, so did the city's 
        organizational interests. The Carolina Art Association inaugurated a citywide 
        survey of historic and architecturally significant buildings. The survey, 
        conducted by Helen Gardner McCormack, included 1,168 buildings. <i>(In 
        1944)</i> the Carolina Art Association published the findings of the survey 
        as <i>This Is Charleston</i>, illustrating more than 500 of the surveyed 
        structures. The result was the first publication of an architectural inventory 
        of an American city. This simple idea of monumental proportion had a far-reaching 
        influence on future work in the city, in other cities, and on the formation 
        of the National Register of Historic Places. <i>(In 1945)</i> Kenneth 
        Chorley, president of Colonial Williamsburg, Inc. planted the seed of 
        what was to become Historic Charleston Foundation, Inc. <i>(In a public 
        speech)</i> he pointed out the need for an independent, nongovernmental 
        organization which could set its own agenda without ties to any existing 
        organization or city politics. The result was the establishment of a nonprofit 
        foundation that could own and operate historic sites and provide educational 
        information and assistance to individuals, civic organizations, and local 
        government following the Colonial Williamsburg model. Historic Charleston 
        Foundation, Inc., was chartered in 1947. The foundation began a Spring 
        Tour of Homes in 1947 fashioned after those in other southern cities that 
        showcased restored historic sites to visiting tourists. The tours provided 
        a public education opportunity to help fulfill the foundation's charter 
        responsibilities. More importantly the tours provided much needed income 
        in the years to follow. The house tour director, Frances S. Edmunds, soon 
        became executive director and guided the foundation's activities for the 
        next 38 years. 
        <p> 
        The 1950s brought about several preservation crises, as well as a rethinking 
        of the approach to historic preservation. The Society for the Preservation 
        of Old Dwellings was renamed the Preservation Society of Charleston, reflecting 
        a broader definition of what was considered important to the community. 
        In 1959 Historic Charleston Foundation began to focus on the rehabilitation 
        of entire neighborhoods through an aggressive purchase and resale agenda. 
        It targeted the Ansonborough neighborhood, a fine collection of post 1840 
        masonry dwellings. The foundation established a revolving fund and options 
        or outright purchases were made with the idea that one or two buildings 
        successfully restored on a street would cause others to follow. The foundation 
        stabilized or partially rehabilitated exteriors of the buildings. The 
        foundation placed easements on the properties before resale, establishing 
        control over the rehabilitation and long term maintenance of the buildings. 
        The buildings were marketed to individuals or families who would take 
        up residence. The program gained momentum and dilapidated and often abandoned 
        tenements gave way to single family dwellings. This innovative program 
        added a significant new dimension to the way historic preservation was 
        accomplished in Charleston. Although the need to react to immediate threats 
        remained, preservation organizations were now taking a proactive, entrepreneurial 
        role within the limits of available funding. 
        <p> In 1959 the city council revised the historic zoning ordinance for 
          the first time, granting the BAR powers over demolitions and the ability 
          to review exterior in alterations to any pre-1860 building, as well 
          as to any building within the Old and Historic Charleston district. 
          Although no additional area was added to the board's jurisdiction, the 
          ordinance gave the BAR a voice.
        <p> <b>1966-1989: MATURATION</b> 
        <p> Charleston in the 1960s struggled with many of the same social and 
          economic issues as other southern cities, the least of which was the 
          need for inner-city economic revitalization. Public sector improvements 
          of the time were not quite as kind. In 1967, the city of Charleston 
          under Mayor J. Palmer Gaillard supported the removal of historic buildings 
          for a new civic auditorium and meeting hall to bring conventions and 
          entertainment downtown. The Preservation Society and Historic Charleston 
          Foundation moved eight of the threatened structures to appropriate infill 
          sites throughout the city and placed the buildings up for sale. Conversely, 
          Mayor Gillard and the city council voted to expand the boundaries of 
          the Old and Historic District, nearly tripling its size, to an east-west 
          line that included one-half of the peninsula's land mass. All the buildings 
          south of the recently constructed Septima Clark Expressway (US Highway 
          17) fell under the jurisdiction of the BAR, with the added power to 
          deny demolition permanently. In 1970 the South Carolina Department of 
          Transportation (SCDOT) sought to expand its highway system west across 
          the Ashley River. The preservation community feared the expansion would 
          have a detrimental effect on the Old and Historic Charleston National 
          Register District (designated in 1966). After the Advisory Council on 
          Historic Preservation determined an adverse effect for the proposed 
          James Island Bridge, SCDOT mitigated the effect by terminating the bridge 
          improvement to the edge of the Ashley River at the end of Calhoun Street, 
          away from the boundaries of the historic district.
        <p> Such public sector struggles identified the need for a more comprehensive 
          understanding of the city's resources. Not until the adoption of the 
          Feiss-Wright Anderson Survey and Preservation Plan in 1974 was a comprehensive 
          architectural inventory, ranking of buildings, and area plan available 
          to the public. The first inventory since the 1944 Carolina Art Association 
          effort, the inventory identified more than 2,800 structures. The preservation 
          plan became the centerpiece for planning and zoning efforts on the peninsula 
          for the next two decades. It recommended a downtown revitalization strategy 
          and stronger enforcement of building codes and height restrictions. 
          It also stimulated the city council to extend the Board of Architectural 
          Review's controls further up the peninsula.
        <p> The election of <a href="#mayor">Joseph P. Riley, Jr.</a> as mayor 
          in the 1970s has had a lasting effect on this historic city. A Charleston 
          native, son of a successful real estate and insurance businessman, graduate 
          of The Citadel, lover of history, the arts, architecture and his city, 
          Riley utilized the unique characteristics of Charleston as a magnet 
          for needed economic development. At the same time he understood the 
          need to maintain the high quality of design and construction reflected 
          in the city's historic architecture. He also displayed a very keen sense 
          of urban design and planning that would maintain the fabric of the city. 
          From the beginning, his administration embraced an aggressive agenda 
          of stimulating a city that was supported by a large military establishment 
          (Navy and Air Force), constant port traffic, and a small tourist economy. 
          It was not enough, however, to attract the kind of money needed to reinstate 
          Charleston as one of the most significant and important cities along 
          the Atlantic coast.
        <p> 
        The city commissioned Barton-Aschman Associates to develop a commercial 
        revitalization plan for the historic commercial core of the peninsula. 
        Noting the need for a new economic stimulant, the study provided Riley 
        the needed support to begin his first major development project. The young 
        and energetic Riley sought out private development to bolster the city's 
        economy. Fearing that businesses would further abandon the city for the 
        suburbs, as so many cities had experienced in recent years, he decided 
        to create the needed stimulant in the commercial core. In 1978 the city 
        announced that a hotel/convention complex, to be called Charleston Center, 
        would be constructed on a blighted block at the most critical commercial 
        corner in the city. The city government acquired several million dollars 
        in HUD Urban Development Action Grant funding for the project. 
        <p> The proposed complex split the city's preservation community in half. 
          Those in favor saw the development as the centerpiece of much-needed 
          revitalization. Opponents saw it as old style urban renewal that would 
          destroy the quality and character of the historic city. Questions over 
          the long-term effect of the project beleaguered the city, developer, 
          and architects for years. Finally after several developers, architects, 
          and a myriad of lawsuits, compromises, and design changes, the center 
          opened eight years later as Charleston Place. The final plan included 
          a 600-room mid-block hotel, meeting/conference facility, and retail 
          shops along the commercial street frontage. It also restored a city 
          block of 19th-century cast-iron storefronts and returned to private 
          ownership property not needed for the development.
        <p> A year later preservationists again had to battle large-scale development. 
          In the shadow of Charleston Place a local private developer sought to 
          demolish the 1938 Art Deco Riviera Theater for a retail/office building. 
          Preservationists collected more than 5,000 signatures against the project 
          and presented the petition at the Board of Architectural Review hearing. 
          More than 200 individuals attended the hearing to urge denial. In a 
          unanimous decision, the board denied outright the loss of a significant 
          landmark. This decision reflected the change in the community's attitude 
          toward what was considered historic in a city that for decades had limited 
          itself to protecting only the earliest of buildings and sites.
        <p> The following year, in spite of this victory, the city council voted 
          against a proposal to expand the National Register district in response 
          to community opposition. The expansion would have included buildings 
          south of the east-west boundary created by the Crosstown Expressway. 
          Residents feared gentrification as a result of the designation and were 
          confused about the role the local Board of Architectural Review would 
          have with this national designation. Although there had been scattered 
          interest in utilization of tax incentives in the area, a local developer 
          attempted to force the issue of designation. His efforts failed to persuade 
          the SHPO <i>(State Historic Preservation Officer)</i> to go against 
          the local recommendation. Although the area would not carry the national 
          recognition that it deserved, the city council amended the zoning ordinance 
          once again to expand the role of the BAR to review all new construction 
          within the proposed boundaries.
        <p> A year and a half later a greater challenge threatened Charleston's 
          historic resources. During the early morning hours of September 21, 
          1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the South Carolina coast northeast of the 
          peninsula. The hurricane affected 85 percent of the city's properties. 
          Immediately, preservation organizations formed a consortium which included 
          the Preservation Society, Historic Charleston Foundation, the Charleston 
          Museum, the southern regional office of the National Trust for Historic 
          Preservation, and city planners. This self-initiated group assessed 
          damage to buildings within the historic district, collected and identified 
          significant architectural elements for salvage, and established weatherization 
          and stabilization procedures. The group disseminated information to 
          property owners, coordinated the efforts of volunteers from the National 
          Park Service and the American Institute of Architects, and served as 
          a clearinghouse for suppliers, vendors, and manufacturers of building 
          materials.
        <p> The city refused to reduce or diminish its requirements for compliance 
          with local building codes and the BAR did not reduce its standards or 
          relinquish the right of approval for changes within the historic district. 
          The battle over the expansion of the National Register district was 
          set aside in the struggle to save the city's historic resources. Uninsured 
          or under-insured property owners cited economic hardship and demanded 
          substitute materials and relief from standard construction practices. 
          The BAR, however, emphatically refused to deviate from established standards 
          by unanimous vote. This decision saved countless historic buildings 
          from demolition and inappropriate modification. 
        <p> <b>CONCLUSION</b> 
        <p> 
        <p>Within the past decade renewed emphasis has been placed on the preservation 
          planning process. South Carolina now requires a historic preservation 
          component in the legally mandated comprehensive planning process. <i>Charleston 
          2000: The City of Charleston's Comprehensive Plan</i> clearly spells 
          out historic preservation goals and objectives as a major component. 
          Since the city's incorporation 215 years ago, Charlestonians have been 
          aware of the need to preserve its urban environment. For nearly a century, 
          citizens have acted to preserve the city's most important buildings. 
          And for the past 55 years urban design and planning have been a means 
          to historic preservation. The work of individuals, organizations, and 
          government have all contributed to the preservation of the city's resources. 
          More importantly it is the respect and cooperation each has shown to 
          the other that makes not only the process but the result unique. It 
          is not a collection of buildings or the city's urban structure that 
          has made this city successful. It is its people.</p>

          Enston Home </font></font></font></p>
        <p align="left">The William Enston Home is an early example of a planned 
          community for the elderly. Developed in the late 19th century, the home 
          is comprised of 24 residential cottages; Memorial Hall, a community 
          building; an infirmary; an engine house; a water tower and an entrance 
          gate. Designed in 1889, the water tower served as the centerpiece of 
          a model waterworks system, and the spacious, landscaped grounds exemplified 
          suburban planning ideals of the 19th century. The buildings also constitute 
          a significant collection of Romanesque Revival architecture, a style 
          rare in Charleston.</p>
        <p> William Enston was the Home's philanthropic benefactor. An English 
          immigrant to Charleston, Enston made his fortune in trade. Upon his 
          death, he bequeathed the majority of his estate to the City of Charleston 
          to establish a benevolent home for the city's aged and infirm residents 
          which would "make old age comfortable." The Home was to be modeled on 
          similar British institutions, specifically one Enston was familiar with 
          in his native Canterbury. Enston specified that the complex be comprised 
          of neat and convenient two-story brick cottages with at least eight 
          acres of land. He also stipulated that potential residents be the old 
          and sick, from 45 to 75 years old, of "good honest character," and not 
          suffering from "lunacy." 
        <p> Enston's estate at his death in 1860 was valued at $1 million, but 
          reduced by half after losses from the Civil War. The project was delayed 
          until after Mrs. Enston's death in 1886, when the City received the 
          whole of the estate. Charleston Mayor William A. Courtenay corresponded 
          with the mayor of Canterbury to develop the concept for the "model village." 
        <p> The majority of the cottages were built in 1889 on 12 acres with shaded 
          and stone-paved roadways, named after various English sites and historical 
          figures. The remaining buildings were all added by the 1930s. Today 
          the complex is owned by the Housing Authority of Charleston, and the 
          restored cottages are home to persons of low to moderate income.

          Military Academy </font></font></font></p>
        <p align="left">The Porter Military Academy site reflects several eras 
          of Charleston history--from major events in the city's settlement, to 
          Civil War and Reconstruction, and more recently important 19th and 20th 
          century educational institutions. As early as the 1700s, the site was 
          used as a potter's field or pauper's graveyard. In 1825, the Federal 
          government acquired the land for a new United States Arsenal, which 
          was partially built sometime thereafter, and greatly enlarged in the 
          1840s. The Confederate army strategically seized the Arsenal at the 
          outbreak of the Civil War, as it contained valuable arms able to supply 
          three military divisions. Federal troops took over the Arsenal in 1865 
          and remained there during Reconstruction until 1879, when it was leased 
          to Reverend Anthony Toomer Porter, a prominent educator and clergyman. 
        </p>
        <p> 
        Dr. Porter, a former South Carolina rice planter, entered the ministry 
        in an attempt to bring order out of the confusion following the Civil 
        War. In 1867, mourning the death of his own son, Reverend Porter founded 
        the Holy Communion Church Institute with his wife, to educate former soldiers 
        and young boys left orphaned or destitute by the war. Dr. Porter's efforts 
        to convert the former arsenal into his expanding educational facility 
        was strongly supported by former Union General William T. Sherman. Holy 
        Communion Church Institute moved to the arsenal in 1880, and became known 
        as the Porter Military Academy by the late 19th century. The school added 
        new buildings to the complex, while using and adapting the existing arsenal 
        buildings for educational needs. In need of a school chapel, Dr. Porter 
        remodeled the artillery shed in 1883 by removing the roof, raising the 
        walls, and adding a Gothic roof and stained glass windows. Now known as 
        St. Luke's, the artillery shed's window and doorway openings are still 
        evident in the chapel today. 
        <p> In 1964 the Medical University of South Carolina purchased the school. 
          Many of the original buildings were demolished to make room for the 
          heart of the Medical campus, but the remaining buildings represent the 
          site's diverse history of uses. Only two remain from the Arsenal complex--St. 
          Luke's Chapel, and Colcock Hall, one of two surviving military buildings 
          in South Carolina built by the Confederate government. The brick walls 
          along Ashley Avenue surrounding the school also date to the late 19th 
          century, and are largely the work of Holten Bell, a prominent African 
          American builder. The Waring Historical Library is the only remaining 
          building from several built by Dr. Porter and a unique building for 
          the State. A Gothic octagonal library with square reading rooms, the 
          building was donated by and named for leading New York clergyman Reverend 
          Charles Frederick Hoffman. Now known as the Waring Library, the current 
          library commemorates Dr. Joseph I. Waring, one of the Medical school's 
          early professors and historian.

          Street Cemetery</font></font></font></p>
        <p>The Coming Street Cemetery, established in 1762, is the oldest Jewish 
          burial ground in the South. Privately owned by Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim 
          Synagogue, the cemetery contains some 600 marble and brownstone grave 
          markers. Most of the markers date to the last half of the 18th century 
          or the first half of the 19th century, and include box tombs, table-top 
          tombs, obelisks, and columns. Many are significant examples of gravestone 
          art, signed by locally prominent sculptors and stonecutters. </p>
        <p><a href="#kah"> Significant artistic markers denote the graves of prominent 
          Charlestonians such as Joshua Lazarus (1791-1861), former president 
          of the Beth Elohim Synagogue and the Charleston Gas Light Company. Lazarus's 
          marker features a fluted column on a pedestal, surmounted by an urn. 
          Marx E. Cohen, Jr. (1839-1865) was a Confederate soldier killed near 
          the end of the Civil War, and his obelisk marker features a cannon below 
          the State and Confederate flags in bas-relief. An elaborately detailed 
          box tomb, described as a "stonecanopy," memorializes Catherine Lopez 
          (1814-1843), wife of David Lopez, builder of the Beth Elohim Synagogue. 
          Lopez is buried in a family plot of land adjacent to the main cemetery 
          that was later incorporated. At the time of her death, she was not permitted 
          burial in the main cemetery because she had not converted to Judaism.</a> 
        <p><a href="#kah"> A stuccoed brick wall surrounds the Cemetery, portions 
          of which are original. An important feature of the site, this brick 
          wall has been a major factor in preserving the intact cemetery over 
          the past two centuries. There are also remains of a wall that once divided 
          the cemetery, reflecting a time in the mid-19th century when the Beth 
          Elohim congregation was divided over a doctrinal dispute. By 1887, Beth 
          Elohim established a new cemetery, and burials in the Coming Street 
          Cemetery are now restricted to the few vacancies in the adjacent family 
          plots. The appearance of the cemetery, or graveyard as it was called 
          historically, has been little altered. Over time, some damage has occurred 
          to individual gravestones from pollution, climate, severe weather and 
          vandalism. </a>

          private burial ground and not open to the public.</i>

          Baptist Church </font></font></font></p>
        <p>Central Baptist Church is thought to be one of the first black churches 
          founded and built solely by African Americans in Charleston. The congregation 
          was founded in 1891 by members of the Morris Street Baptist Church, 
          which lead the way in the formation of a Negro Baptist Church association 
          in 1867 and a statewide organization in 1876. Designed by black architect 
          John P. Hutchinson, the Central Baptist Church was completed in 1893 
          and was first used by the congregation in August of that year. </p>
        <p> Architecturally, Central Baptist is an excellent example of a vernacular 
          Carpenter Gothic style church. Victorian era churches such as this are 
          rare in Charleston, largely due to the prevalence of well constructed 
          churches from earlier periods. Central Baptist's architectural features 
          typical of this style include the detailed protective hood above the 
          central double doors and Gothic windows with plate tracery. The original 
          octagonal belfry tower topped with a dome was replaced by a square tower 
          in the 1950s. The church's interior contains carved wooden details, 
          a semicircular apse with Gothic arch, and the original galleries and 
          pews.
        <p> 
        <p>During its first 20 years, the church grew and prospered. This prosperity 
          is reflected in the addition of murals depicting the scenes of the life 
          of Christ completed from 1912 to 1915. These murals, painted by Amohamad 
          Milai, a native of Calcutta, India, are significant works of folk art. 
          The scenes portray the Crucifixion, the Ascension, and the Resurrection. 
          The church continued to grow after the completion of these paintings, 
          and still has a strong congregation. The building was renovated in 1977. Although severely damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, the church was repaired and the interior paintings were restored in 2003.</p>
        <p>Central Baptist Church is located at 26 Radcliffe Street. The building 
          is open to the public. Call 843-577-4543 for further information. </p>

          Institute</font></font></font></p>
        <p>Constructed in 1867 to 1868, the Avery Normal Institute was Charleston's 
          first free secondary school for African Americans. Reverend F. L. Cardoza 
          organized the school at the end of the Civil War in 1865. Cardoza received 
          a grant of $10,000 for his school from the estate of Reverend Charles 
          Avery of Pittsburgh, a philanthropic Methodist, for whom the school 
          was named. Further financial assistance was received from the Freedman's 
          Bureau, local merchants, and the American Missionary Association of 
          New York City, who also staffed the school. Constructed by local white 
          contractors for $17,000, the school was designed in the Italianate style 
          with arched entry, cupola, and piazzas running the length of the building 
          and opening into classrooms.</p>
        <p> 
        The School operated as a private institution serving Charleston's most 
        prominent free black families. By 1800, enrollment had reached nearly 
        500. In 1947, the institute became a public city school. Notable graduates 
        of Avery Institute are T.M. Stuart, a Supreme Court Justice in Liberia; 
        Dr. R.S. Wilkinson, President of South Carolina State College; and Richard 
        E. Fields, the first African American in modern times to be named as Judge 
        of the Municipal Court of Charleston, and the second black Circuit Judge. 
        <p> Currently known as the Avery Research Center for African American 
          History and Culture, the center is part of the College of Charleston 
          and operates as a museum and archives for African American history and 
          culture. It is one of more than 1400 historically significant buildings 
          within the Charleston Old and Historic District.

          Bethel United Methodist Church</font></font></font></p>
        <p>Old Bethel United Methodist Church is the third oldest church building 
          surviving in Charleston. The church is an architectural reminder of 
          the significant relationship between African Americans and the Methodist 
          Church in Charleston. Methodists conducted extensive missionary work 
          among African Americans in South Carolina, sometimes suffering persecution 
          for their suspected abolitionist tendencies. Indicative of the Methodist 
          Church's philosophy of encouraging black membership, Old Bethel was 
          founded and paid for by both black and white citizens.</p>
        <p> Construction began in 1797 and was completed in 1807. The church was 
          originally constructed in the gabled meetinghouse style with white clapboards 
          after a design by Francis Asbury, the first Methodist bishop in the 
          United States. It stood at the corner of Pitt and Calhoun Streets, then 
          the extreme northwestern part of the city. Membership in the congregation 
          of Old Bethel was open to both free blacks and slaves. However, in 1834 
          a schism developed over whether blacks were to be restricted to sitting 
          in the galleries. By 1840 the black members seceded to form their own 
          congregation.
        <p> 
        <p>In 1852 the church was moved to the western portion of the lot on which 
          it stood, to be used by the black congregation. A new church, <a href="#bet">Bethel 
          Methodist</a>, was built on the original site, to serve the white congregation. 
          After the church was given to the black population, in 1880, it was 
          moved across Calhoun Street to its present location. The addition of 
          a gabled portico supported by four fluted Corinthian columns documents 
          changing styles in ecclesiastical architecture. The interior of the 
          church was likely damaged by the 1886 earthquake in Charleston, and 
          the pressed metal ceiling and Victorian era furnishing of Old Bethel date 
          to the end of the 19th century. The church currently serves a black 
          congregation, which includes descendants of the 1880 congregation. </p>

        <p>The first Methodist congregation in Charleston purchased this parcel 
          of land in 1795 and the <a href="#obm">Old Bethel United Methodist Church</a> 
          building was erected here in 1797. A schism between black and white 
          members of the congregation developed in the 1830s. As a result the 
          original church was moved to the western portion of the lot in 1852, 
          to be used by the black Methodists. Shortly thereafter work was begun 
          at the original site for this second Methodist Church for the white 
          congregation. </p>
        <p> Records from 1852 indicate that the anticipated cost for the church 
          was $18,000. The building was constructed in 1853-1854 by local architect, 
          Mr. Curtis, who came from a family of architects and builders. Bethel 
          Methodist Church is an exceptional example of Greek Doric Temple architecture 
          common to antebellum churches. Even with an uncharacteristic steeply-pitched 
          roof, the church is one of the best examples of Greek Doric temple architecture 
          in the State. The steep pitch would have allowed rainwater to drain 
          more quickly. The most prominent architectural feature is the massive 
          hexastyle Doric portico, with simple pediment and entablature. Windows, 
          chimneys, verandahs, and refined details, as well as the building's 
          overall mass, materials, and craftsmanship are elegant and innovative. 
          Bethel was the only Methodist church in Charleston which remained open 
          during the Civil War, and it survived the earthquake of 1886 intact. 
          Although there have been interior alterations, the exterior has been 
          well-preserved.

        <p>
        <p>The College of Charleston is the oldest municipal college in the United 
          States, and a National Historic Landmark. Founded in 1770, and chartered 
          in 1785, the College possesses additional historical significance as 
          the oldest institute of higher learning in South Carolina, and the 13th 
          oldest in the country. The center of the small campus contains its core 
          of historic mid-19th- century buildings. Three principal structures--the 
          Main Building, the Library, and Gate Lodge--are situated around a square 
          college green with evergreen oaks, known as The Cistern. This name is 
          derived from a 19th-century oval cistern constructed there to hold the 
          campus's water supply.</p>
        <p> 
        <p>The founders of the college include three signers of the Declaration 
          of Independence, and three fathers of the United States Constitution. 
          Classes were held in former Revolutionary War barracks until the first 
          new building was constructed. Designed by Philadelphia architect William 
          Strickland, the simple rectangular brick Main Building was completed 
          in 1829. In 1854 prominent local architect Edward Brickell White extensively 
          remodeled the Main Building (now known as Randolph Hall), adding an 
          Ionic portico and wings. White had previously designed the Gate Lodge 
          (now Porter's Lodge), a two-story Roman Revival brick building, in 1852. 
          The Towell Library, constructed from 1854 to 56 by George E. Walker, 
          is a Classical Revival two-story brick building with Italianate details, 
          now serving as administrative offices. Both the Lodge and Library have 
          been little altered. As a whole, the complex is an outstanding example 
          of academic architecture of the 19th century.</p>

          Mathew's German Lutheran Church</font></font></font></p>
        <p align="left">Patterned after typical German Gothic churches, St. Mathew's 
          German Lutheran Church is a Gothic Revival church designed by local 
          architect John Henry Deveraux and constructed between 1867 and 1872. 
          An immigrant from Ireland, Deveraux became a noted architect in Charleston 
          by the late 1860s. Its 297-foot steeple once made it the tallest building 
          in South Carolina; it continues to possess the tallest spire. The congregation 
          was founded originally by German-speaking Lutherans in 1840. Their first 
          church was located at the corner of Hasell and Anson Streets, now St. 
          Johannes's Lutheran church. As Charleston's German community grew quickly 
          in the mid-19th century, so did the congregation, and the need for a 
          larger church. Three thousand people gathered for the dedication ceremony 
          of St. Mathew's in 1872. </p>
        <p> In 1965, a fire destroyed much of the interior of the church and steeple, 
          which crashed spectacularly into King Street. The damaged portions were 
          carefully restored except for a finial on the steeple. The iron finial, 
          designed by prominent Charleston ironworker Christopher Werner, was 
          prohibitively expensive to replace at $500,000. The stained glass windows 
          in the apse and under the balcony, as well as the pulpit, are original 
          to the building. St. Matthew's is one of more than 1400 historically 
          significant buildings within the Charleston Old and Historic District.

          Square</font></font></font></p>
        <p>Previously known as the Citadel Green, Marion Square is a 10 acre rectangular 
          plot of land that was conveyed to the colony of South Carolina in 1758. 
          The Old Citadel, or <a href="#ssa"> South Carolina State Arsenal</a>, 
          currently sits on the north side of the square where a group of buildings 
          known as the Tobacco Inspection once stood. These buildings were erected 
          by the State in 1790 for the storage and inspection of tobacco prior 
          to its shipment. The grounds of the Square served as a muster ground 
          for the State Arsenal. At one time the Square was bisected by Lowndes 
          Street and divided into building lots. Houses remained on the King Street 
          side of the square until the latter part of the 19th century. Lowndes 
          Street disappeared, but Tobacco Street, which runs along the south side 
          of the Old Citadel, remains a dedicated public street. According to 
          the lease agreement made with the City of Charleston, the central portion 
          of the square is to be kept open forever as a parade ground for the 
          Sumter Guards and the Washington Light Infantry.</p>
        <p> 
        Marion Square also houses several monuments. The most noted is the John 
        C. Calhoun Statue. Calhoun, a native South Carolinian, was a renowned 
        orator, Secretary of War, U.S. Senator, and Vice President. The cornerstone, 
        laid in 1858 before construction was halted by the Civil War, contained 
        a cannon ball used in the Revolutionary War battle of <a href="#sum"> 
        Fort Moultrie </a>, a banner used in Calhoun's funeral, $100 in Continental 
        money, a lock of Calhoun's hair, and the last speech he delivered in the 
        U.S. Senate, on March 4, 1850. The original statue was criticized for 
        its poor casting, and replaced in 1896 with the current stone statue with 
        cast-iron palmettos flanking its base. Marion Square also contains a remnant 
        from the 18th century fortifications of the city; and the Bandstand, designed 
        by August Constantine and constructed in 1944. 
        <p> Lately Marion Square became the site of a new Holocaust Memorial. 
          A master plan has recently been completed for a major relandscaping 
          and renovation project. Marion Square is one of more than 1400 historically 
          significant sites within the Charleston Old and Historic District.

          Carolina State Arsenal</font></font></font></p>
        <p>
        <p>The South Carolina State Arsenal, more commonly known as the Old Citadel, 
          is associated with several aspects of Charleston's history. The impetus 
          for the Arsenal's construction in the early 1830s was the 1822 <a href="#ema">slave 
          revolt</a> led by Denmark Vesey. In 1842 the South Carolina Military 
          Academy, a liberal arts military college, was established by the state 
          legislature. The new Academy took over the arsenal the following year, 
          and the school soon became know as The Citadel in reference to the fortress-like 
          appearance of the building. Many Citadel alumni fought in the Civil 
          War. Cadets remained at the school but were periodically ordered by 
          the governor to support the Confederacy, and helped drill recruits, 
          manufacture ammunition, protect arms depots, and guard Union prisoners. 
          Citadel cadets were responsible for firing the first shots of the Civil 
          War, January 9, 1861, at the Union relief vessel approaching <a href="#sum">Fort 
          Sumter</a>. From 1865 to 1881, during Reconstruction in Charleston, 
          Federal troops occupied the Citadel and the school was closed. Classes 
          resumed at the Citadel in 1882, and continued here until the school 
          was relocated to a campus on the banks of the Ashley River in 1922. 
        </p>
        <p> 
        <p>Two well-known Charleston architects, Frederick Wesner and Edward Brickell 
          White, are credited with the Citadel's design. The original State Arsenal 
          building was a simple-two story brick building surrounding an interior 
          courtyard, designed by Wesner. White was responsible for changes to 
          the building later in the century, and added the upper floors and wings. 
          These two periods of construction are most visible from the courtyard, 
          where the original first floor arches are offset by tiers of smaller 
          arches in the upper floors. Charleston County used the building for 
          government offices during much of the 20th century. In 1994 a local 
          development firm renovated the building for use as a hotel.</p>

          (AME) Church </font></font></font></p>
        <p>The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church is a Gothic Revival 
          style church built in 1891. Retaining its original alter, communion 
          rail, pews, and light fixtures the church is one of only a few unaltered 
          religious interiors in Charleston, especially from the Victorian period. 
          The brick Gothic church with its tall steeple replaced an earlier 1872 
          church badly damaged by the 1886 earthquake. Today Emanuel is the oldest 
          AME church in the South, and houses the oldest black congregation south 
          of Baltimore, Maryland. </p>
        <p> The history of this congregation reflects the development of religious 
          institutions for African Americans in Charleston. Its roots stem from 
          a religious group of free blacks and slaves organized in 1791. In 1816, 
          black members of Charleston's Methodist Episcopal church withdrew over 
          disputed burial ground, and under the leadership of Morris Brown, formed 
          a separate congregation. The church's 1400 members soon thereafter established 
          themselves an African Methodist Episcopal church, a denomination formally 
          established in 1816 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Two years later, 
          Brown and other ministers of the church were jailed for violating state 
          and local laws which prohibited religious gatherings of slaves and free 
          blacks independent of white supervision. 
        <p> 
        In 1822 the church was investigated for its involvement with a planned 
        slave revolt. Denmark Vesey, one of the church's founders, organized a 
        major slave uprising in Charleston. Vesey was raised in slavery in the 
        Virgin Islands among newly imported Africans. He was the personal servant 
        of slavetrader Captain Joseph Vesey, who settled in Charleston in 1783. 
        Denmark remained with him until in 1799, when he was able to purchase 
        his freedom with a winning lottery ticket worth $1500. He became a successful 
        carpenter, especially among Charleston's majority black population. Beginning 
        in December 1821, Vesey began to organize a slave rebellion, but authorities 
        were informed of the plot before it could take place. Three hundred thirteen 
        alleged participants were arrested, and 35 including Vesey were executed. 
        The plot created mass hysteria throughout the Carolinas and the South. 
        Brown, suspected but never convicted of knowledge of the plot, went north 
        to Philadelphia where he eventually became the second bishop of the AME 
        denomination. 
        <p> During the Vesey controversy, the AME church was burned. Worship services 
          continued after the church was rebuilt until 1834 when all-black churches 
          were outlawed. The congregation subsequently met in secret until 1865 
          when it was formally reorganized, and the name Emanuel was adopted. 
          Today, Emanuel AME Church is one of more than 1400 historically significant 
          buildings within the Charleston Old and Historic District.

          Kadosh Beth Elohim Synagogue</font></font></font></p>
        <p>Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim Synagogue, a National Historic Landmark, is 
          the country's second oldest synagogue and the oldest in continuous use. 
          The American Reform Judaism movement originated at this site in 1824. 
          The congregation of Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim--meaning Holy Congregation 
          House of God--was established in colonial Charleston in 1749, and is 
          now the nation's fourth oldest Jewish community. The building reflects 
          the history of Jewish worship in Charleston, as well as the high degree 
          of religious tolerance within the Carolina colony.</p>
        <p> The Beth Elohim congregation began as an Orthodox community, founded 
          primarily by Sephardic immigrants (of Spanish and Portuguese ancestry). 
          By the end of the 18th century the Beth Elohim congregation had become 
          the largest Jewish community in the nation, with a membership of 500. 
          This synagogue was built in 1840, on the site of the congregation's 
          first synagogue destroyed in the Charleston fire of 1838. The building 
          is an excellent example of the Greek Revival style, as its form, portico 
          and rich ornamentation are adapted from classic Greek temples. Designed 
          by New York architect Cyrus L. Warner, the temple was built by congregation 
          member, David Lopez. 
        <p> 
        <p>By 1841, the majority of the congregation was embracing Reform Judaism, 
          and the first service held in the new temple reflected this ideology. 
          The Reform Movement, an attempt to modernize synagogue worship and a 
          reevaluation of Jewish theology, had its roots in Hamburg, Germany, 
          in the 1810s, and quickly spread throughout central Europe and to the 
          United States. Worship reform included choral singing, organ music, 
          and the use of German instead of Hebrew for prayers and sermons. In 
          1824, 47 members of Beth Elohim petitioned the trustees to abridge the 
          Hebrew rituals and conduct prayers and sermons in English. The denial 
          of these requests resulted in a temporary split of the congregation, 
          but by 1833 a united Beth Elohim had nearly 200 members supporting the 
          Reform Movement. After the burning of the first synagogue and the election 
          of a new rabbi, the inaugural service of this synagogue held in 1841 
          contained modernized ritual and Beth Elohim formally became the first 
          American Reform congregation. Today, the Synagogue still serves the 
          Reform Judaism community. A small museum contains artifacts pertinent 
          to the history of the congregation, such as a letter written to the 
          congregation by George Washington. </p>

          Mary's Roman Catholic Church </font></font></font></p>
        <p>The congregation of St. Mary's was the first Roman Catholic Church 
          in the Carolinas and Georgia. A sufficient number of Catholic immigrants 
          had arrived in Charleston by the late 18th century, that Reverend Ryan, 
          an Irish priest, was sent to the city in 1788. The Hasell Street site 
          was purchased for the church by trustees one year later, and the congregation 
          has worshiped here ever since. The congregation first worshiped in a 
          dilapidated Methodist meeting house that was at the site. In 1801 the 
          congregation constructed their own brick church. The Charleston fire 
          of 1838 that burned much of the surrounding Ansonborough neighborhood 
          also destroyed most of the Catholic church. The present building was 
          completed in 1839 in the Classical Revival style. Its monumental form, 
          elements and ornamental details are adapted from classic Roman architecture 
          with typical Classical details such as its arched openings and Tuscan 
          portico with a parapet.</p>
        <p> 
        <p>Reflecting early French influence in the Charleston congregation, many 
          of the tombstones in the churchyard are in French, and the parish registers 
          were kept in that language until 1822. In 1960, the interior of the 
          church was restored. The pews of the sanctuary are divided by a central 
          aisle, above which are galleries on three sides. The painting that hangs 
          over the altar was originally painted in 1814, and hung in the earlier 
          brick church. Salvaged after the 1838 fire, the original artist, John 
          S. Cogdell, was able to restore the painting. The works on the other 
          walls and on the ceiling are copies of old masters, and were painted 
          in Rome before being installed here in 1896. The vitality and growth 
          of the church at the turn of the 20th century is evident in the numerous 
          gifts to the church by parishioners, including a series of stained glass 
          arched windows, and a polished marble altar.</p>

          Hall and Sheds</font></font></font></font></font>
        <p>The Market Hall and Sheds, a National Historic Landmark, are the only 
          surviving market buildings in Charleston, and one of a small number 
          of market complexes still extant in the United States. The Market is 
          also considered to be one of Charleston's best examples of Greek Revival 
          style architecture, exemplified by its massive portico supported by 
          Tuscan columns. The buildings were constructed in 1840 to 41 and were 
          designed by prominent local architect Edward Brickell White. The Market 
          was the commercial hub of Charleston for many years and is an important 
          part of the city's commercial heritage.</p>
        <p> 
        The land on which the Market sits was donated in 1788 by the Pinckney 
        family for use as a city market. The first market buildings consisted 
        of a beef market, country produce market and a fish market. White's 1841 
        market complex replaced the charred remains of these early buildings after 
        the 1838 Charleston fire. Sheep and bull skulls decorate the stucco frieze 
        of the Market Hall, symbolizing the presence of a meat market. The arcaded 
        basement of the Hall is a typical characteristic of the region's architecture. 
        The series of open-air sheds to the rear of the hall have brick columns, 
        tile roofs, rectangular and arched openings, and some lattice work and 
        louver panels. Meat and produce were brought to the market daily from 
        nearby rural communities. Vendors were required to bring only fresh products. 
        To that end, remaining products were thrown in the street at the end of 
        the market day. Buzzards (Charleston eagles) scavenged the surrounding 
        streets for this waste, a service so valued by Charlestonians, that the 
        birds were protected by law. Other ordinances regulated butcher cuts and 
        weights and required vendors to wear clean white aprons. 
        <p> The Market Hall is normally occupied by the Daughters of the American 
          Revolution, a museum on the second floor, and various shops underneath. 
          However, the Market Hall is currently closed for renovation. The Sheds 
          continue to be used as a market place for individual vendors to sell 
          a great variety of Low Country arts and crafts.
        <p><i><font face="arial" size="-1">The Market Hall and Sheds are located 
          on Market St. between Meeting and East Bay Sts. The sheds are filled 
          with vendors everyday around 9:00am to 6:00pm, and sometimes later on

          States Custom House </font></font></font></p>
        <p>Majestically overlooking East Bay Street and the harbor, the United 
          States Custom House is one of the most striking buildings in Charleston. 
          It is an outstanding example of a public building and reflects the time 
          when Charleston was one of the country's busiest port cities. The cruciform 
          building, executed in the Roman Corinthian order, is monumental in scale, 
          measuring 259 feet on its east-west axis and 152 feet on its north-south 
          axis. Marble is used throughout the building and highlighted in details 
          such as office fireplaces. The interior of the building revolves around 
          a two-story center room, called the Business Room. Fourteen Corinthian 
          columns support its second floor gallery, and most offices open onto 
          this room. The ceiling is ornamented with artificial sky lights, a depiction 
          of the American flag and other patriotic symbols, and stenciled classical 
          motifs. </p>
        <p> 
        Prior to the construction of the Custom House, port business was transacted 
        in the <a href="#exc">Exchange</a>. In need of larger facilities, this 
        site between East Bay and the Cooper River was purchased by Congress in 
        1849. It was formerly the site of Craven's Bastion, a colonial-era fortification. 
        Although a competition for the design contract was won by Charleston architect 
        Edward C. Jones, federal authorities awarded the project to Ammi Burnham 
        Young. Young was the Supervising Architect of the <a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc35.htm">U. 
        S. Treasury Building, </a> and one of 19th-century America's leading architects. 
        His design for the Custom House apparently coordinated various elements 
        of the competition drawings. Noted Charleston architect, Edward Brickell 
        White acted as superintendent of construction which began in 1853. Hampered 
        by unforseen engineering problems of the site, the building was unfinished 
        at the outbreak of the Civil War. Construction was suspended until 1870, 
        when architect A.B. Mullet arranged for further Congressional appropriations 
        to complete the war damaged building. To reduce costs and hasten completion, 
        Mullet's plan modified the east and west porticoes and omitted a dome 
        and side porticoes of the original design. 
        <p> Finally complete in 1879, this building has been used ever since as 
          a United States Custom House. A new federal building that opened in 
          the early 1960s threatened its continued use, but due to the united 
          support of local preservationists, legislators, and U.S. Customs Officials, 
          the building still functions today as it was originally intended.

          Magazine </font></font></font></p>
        <p>A National Historic Landmark, the Powder Magazine, is the oldest public 
          building in South Carolina, and reflects the city's early, sometimes 
          volatile, history. It is the only remaining building from the era of 
          the Lords Proprietors (the colonial governors of South Carolina), when 
          Spain and France still contested England's claims to the region. Charles 
          Town was the southernmost English settlement in the late 1600s, and 
          subject to attacks by the Spanish, French, Native Americans, and pirates. 
          Defense of the colony was a major priority and in addition to fortification 
          walls constructed around the city the Powder Magazine was built in 1713 
          to store the city's supply of gun powder. </p>
        <p> The Powder Magazine's tile roof is typical of very early buildings, 
          as are the 32-inch thick brick walls, which originally would not have 
          had windows. The steep hip roof is punctuated by gables on all sides. 
          The interior roof structure was constructed so that the building would 
          implode were any explosions to occur inside. After a new magazine was 
          built in 1748, this structure was condemned in 1770. Shortly thereafter, 
          the outbreak of the Revolutionary War created a new demand for the old 
          Magazine, and it was again used to store powder. After 1820, the building 
          was used for a variety of things including storage, a printing house, 
          and livery stable. 
        <p> Since 1902 the Powder Magazine has been owned by the South Carolina 
          Society of Colonial Dames, which operates the property as a museum of 
          early Charleston history. The building has recently undergone an extensive 
          archaeological and architectural conservation effort led by the Historic

          Congregational Church and Parish House</font></font></font></p>
        <p align="left">The Circular Congregational Church, a National Historic 
          Landmark, is one of the few examples in Charleston of the adaptation 
          of the Romanesque style that was made popular by architect Henry Hobson 
          Richardson. The Church is an excellent example of this architectural 
          style in its massing, broad roof plane, ribbons of windows and openings, 
          short tower, and large arched entry. The present building is the third 
          structure to be built on this site, and was constructed circa 1892. 
          In spite of its name, the plan of the church is more complex than circular; 
          shaped like a cloverleaf with three semi-circular parts and one rectangular.</p>
        <p>English Congregationalists, Scotch and Irish Presbyterians, and French 
          Huguenots of the original settlement of Charles Town founded this dissenting 
          congregation, known as the Independent Church, around 1681. Their first 
          church building, erected before 1695, was known as the White Meeting 
          House, for which Meeting Street was named. A second meeting house was 
          built at this site in 1732. In 1804 to 1806 this church was replaced 
          by a circular structure designed by architect Robert Mills, often referred 
          to as the first professionally trained American architect, and a Charleston 
          native. At this time, Mills also designed the Parish House, a good example 
          of his ability to create Greek Revival temples of small proportions. 
          The present church is named for Mill's earlier church, which burned 
          during a 1861 fire, and stood in ruins until the 1886 earthquake destroyed 
          it completely. Services were held in the Parish House until the current 
          church was completed. Designed by architects Stevenson and Green, the 
          Richardsonian Romanesque church was constructed as the city was rebuilding 
          after that earthquake and reused bricks from the older structure. The 
          graveyard is the city's oldest burial ground with one monument remaining 
          from the 17th century. Today, Circular Congregational Church is a congregation 
          of the United Church of Christ and has an ecumenical relationship with 
          the Presbyterian Church USA.

          John's Lutheran Church </font></font></font></p>
        <p>St. John's Lutheran Church houses Charleston's oldest Lutheran congregation.
           Built from 1816 to 1818, the design of the church is attributed to
          well-known 
          Charleston architect and church member Frederick Wesner. Numerous other
           Charleston craftsman and builders contributed to its design and construction.
          
          The rectangular, stuccoed brick building combines Federal and Baroque
           elements. The Italianate steeple with bell-shaped roof was not added
          
          until 1859, and was built by David Lopez, contractor for the <a href="#kah">Kadal
           Kadosh Beth Elohim Synagogue</a>. While it is not clear who designed
            the steeple, famous miniaturist and architect Charles Fraser submitted
           
          several steeple designs to the church prior to its construction. The
            church was damaged in the Charleston earthquake of 1886 and the 1891
           
          hurricane, after which a recessed chancel with memorial windows was
            also added.  The church also was damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989
           but has been restored.</p>
        <p> 
        <p>The first Lutheran congregation had been formally organized in Charleston 
          by 1752, and their first building dedicated by 1764. This wooden building 
          with a steeple stood behind the site of the current church on Clifford 
          Street, which was known in 1788 as "Dutch Church Alley." The pastor 
          of the church during the American Revolution, Reverend John Nicholas 
          Martin, was expelled from the city by the British as he refused to pray 
          for the King of England. Dr. John Bachman, from Rhinebeck, New York, 
          became St. John's pastor in 1815, and directed the construction of the 
          current church. He led the organization of the South Carolina Synod, 
          the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, and Newberry College and 
          trained the first black ministers in Lutheranism. Bachman was pastor 
          until 1874, including the tumultuous years surrounding the Civil War. 
          While reluctant to see South Carolina secede from the Union, Bachman 
          also believed that the southern cause was just, and made the opening 
          prayer at the Secession Convention. Two of Bachman's daughters married 
          sons of John James Audubon, with whom he collaborated on the famous 
          books Birds of America and The Quadruped of North America. St. John's 
          is one of more than 1400 historically significant buildings within the 
          Charleston Old and Historic District. </p>

          Church</font></font></font></p>
        <p>The Unitarian Church, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest Unitarian 
          church in the South. In colonial Charleston, members of the <a href="#cir">Circular 
          Congregational Church</a> (then known as the Independent Church) were 
          so numerous the need arose to build a second church building. Construction 
          began at this Archdale site in 1772, but was temporarily interrupted 
          by the Revolutionary War. The small rectangular brick church was finally 
          completed in 1787. In 1817, the Archdale congregation was chartered 
          as the Second Independent Church, with a Unitarian minister presiding. 
          As the American Unitarian Association was not organized until 1825, 
          it was not until 1839 that this congregation was rechartered as Unitarian. 
          The church received a major remodeling in the mid-19th century and is 
          today a statement of the emotional mood of the era when the romantic 
          and picturesque were dominant not only in literature but also in building 
          design.<br>
        </p>
        <p> 
        <p> Architect Francis D. Lee is responsible for the 19th-century Gothic 
          Revival additions to the building. In 1852 his two-year renovation of 
          the church began, which included the addition of the rear chancel, a 
          four-story tower and stucco to the original brick walls. The remodeled 
          church exhibited typical Gothic features such as the crenellated tower, 
          arched windows, stained glass panels, and Tudor arch entrance. On the 
          exterior, false buttresses are used for visual effect rather than as 
          structural supports, as is the interior vaulting, made of lath and plaster. 
          This vaulting is modeled on the that of Henry VII chapel at Westminster 
          in London, England. When the building suffered significant damage in 
          the earthquake of 1886, people across the country sent donations to 
          fund repairs.

          Jail </font></font></font></p>
        <p>The Old Jail building served as the Charleston County Jail from its 
          construction in 1802 until 1939. In 1680, as the city of Charleston 
          was being laid out, a four-acre square of land was set aside at this 
          location for public use. In time a hospital, poor house, workhouse for 
          runaway slaves, and this jail were built on the square. When the Jail 
          was constructed in 1802 it consisted of four stories, topped with a 
          two-story octagonal tower. Charleston architects Barbot & Seyle were 
          responsible for 1855 alterations to the building, including a rear octagonal 
          wing, expansions to the main building and the Romanesque Revival details. 
          This octagonal wing replaced a fireproof wing with individual cells, 
          designed by Robert Mills in 1822, five years earlier than his notable 
          <a href="#fir">Fireproof Building</a>. The 1886 earthquake badly damaged 
          the tower and top story of the main building, and these were subsequently 
          removed.</p>
        <p> 
        <p>The Old Jail housed a great variety of inmates. John and Lavinia Fisher, 
          and other members of their gang, convicted of robbery and murder in 
          the Charleston Neck region were imprisoned here in 1819 to 1820. Some 
          of the last 19th-century high-sea pirates were jailed here in 1822 while 
          they awaited hanging. The jail was active after the discovery of <a href="#ema">Denmark 
          Vesey's</a> planned slave revolt. In addition to several hundreds of 
          free blacks and slaves jailed for their involvement, four white men 
          convicted of supporting the 1822 plot were imprisoned here. Vesey spent 
          his last days in the tower before being hanged. Increased restrictions 
          were placed on slaves and free blacks in Charleston as a result of the 
          Vesey plot, and law required that all black seaman be kept here while 
          they were in port. During the Civil War, Confederate and Federal prisoners 
          of war were incarcerated here. It is one of more than 1400 historically

          Marine Hospital</font></font></font></p>
        <p>A National Historic Landmark, the Old Marine Hospital, was designed 
          by Robert Mills, often referred to as the first professionally trained 
          American architect, and a Charleston native. Mills was responsible for 
          the <a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc72.htm">Washington 
          Monument</a> and many public buildings throughout the State and nation. 
          He also developed a pattern design from his Charleston hospital that 
          was used to build similar hospitals around the country. The Old Marine 
          Hospital is one of only eight remaining from a group of around 30 marine 
          hospitals built before the Civil War.</p>
        <p> The Marine Hospital was also one of the most controversial buildings 
          of Charleston's antebellum period, viewed by state's rights advocates 
          as an illustration of the Federal government's abuse of its powers. 
          The Marine Hospital Fund, established in 1798 by an Act of Congress, 
          was one of the earliest manifestations of Federal involvement in the 
          area of public health, and provided the first Federal health care and 
          social welfare initiative for United States sailors. Funding for the 
          hospitals was deducted from sailors' wages and supplemented by shipping 
          industry taxes. In Charleston, many people resented the heavy hand of 
          the Federal government in the construction of their Marine Hospital, 
          which began in 1831. Even though Mills had left the city only two years 
          earlier, state's rights supporters were particularly infuriated by the 
          replacement of their local architect and contractors with Mills and 
          other professionals from Washington D.C., as well as the increased costs 
          of the project. By the time of its completion in 1834, the Marine Hospital 
          was rejected by Charlestonians as an unworthy civic accomplishment.
        <p> 
        Originally a U-shaped building, the two large wings that once projected 
        from the rear were removed because of extensive fire damage. The subtle 
        Gothic features of the building include its pointed arches, windows and 
        clustered columns, reminiscent of medieval religious architecture. The 
        delicate porch railings were designed to resemble the tracery around Gothic 
        stained glass windows. In the 19th century, Gothic architecture of was 
        believed to be an appropriate style for hospital design. Widely used in 
        Charleston's domestic architecture, the piazzas were an adaptation to 
        climate as they provided some protection from the weather. 
        <p> After the Civil War, the Episcopal Church used the building as a free 
          school for black children. From 1895-1939 the structure served as the 
          Jenkins Orphanage, whose <a href="http://www.nps.gov/applications/redirect/?sUrl=http://www.kenyon.edu/projects/neh/music/jenkins/jenkins-orphanage.htm" target="_parent">famous 
          band</a> traveled the United States and Europe on fund-raising tours. 
          In 1939 the Housing Authority of Charleston purchased the building for 
          administrative offices, a purpose it still serves today.

          Library Society</font></font></font></p>
        <p>The Charleston Library Society is thought to be the third library established 
          in the United States. It was organized in 1748 by a group of young men 
          who wished to keep up with the scientific and philosophical issues of 
          the day, and hoped to "save their descendants from sinking into savagery." 
          The initial group consisted of nine merchants, two lawyers, a schoolmaster, 
          a physician, two planters and a perukemaker (wig-maker). The Library 
          Society was active in many areas. To promote education, it began giving 
          funds for the establishment of a college in the 1770s, hence the foundation 
          of the <a href="#col">College of Charleston</a>. The Society purchased 
          scientific instruments and appointed a committee to collect materials 
          that promoted the study of the natural history of the area. These collections 
          became the foundation of the Charleston Museum, the oldest museum in 
          the United States. </p>
        <p> 
        In the early years, successive librarians kept the books in their custody, 
        until 1792 when they were stored on the upper floor of the Statehouse. 
        The original collection was lost when that building was destroyed by fire 
        in 1778. In 1836, the Society bought the vacated building of the <a href="#cit">Bank 
        of South Carolina</a>. During the Civil War part of the Library's collection 
        was taken to the South Carolina State Capitol for safe keeping. When these 
        items were returned after the war, the Library also absorbed another institution, 
        the Apprentice's Library. As a result of that merger, the Society today 
        maintains a tradition of granting each adult member a free minor membership 
        to any person under 21. 
        <p> The current building was constructed in 1914 by Phildelphia architects 
          McGoodwin and Hawley. It was designed in the Beaux Arts classical style 
          using stuccoed brick and marble detailing. Built on a raised basement, 
          the main floor is punctuated by arched Palladian windows separated by 
          double pilasters with Ionic capitals. Today, the Library still serves 
          researchers from all over the world, in person and by correspondence, 
          providing access to the collections of rare books, periodicals, manuscripts, 
          clippings, maps, directories, almanacs, and a newspaper collection that 
          dates to 1732. The Library Society is one of more than 1400 historically 
          significant buildings within the Charleston Old and Historic District.

          Philip's Episcopal Church</font></font></font></p>
        <p>St. Philip's Episcopal Church, a National Historic Landmark, houses 
          the oldest congregation in South Carolina and was the first Anglican 
          church established south of Virginia. This church is the third building 
          to house the congregation, which was formed by Charles Town colonists. 
          The first church, built in 1681, was a small wooden building located 
          at the present site of <a href="#smi">St. Michael's Episcopal Church</a>. 
          In the early 18th century, the congregation built a second brick church 
          at the site of the current church. It's construction was partially funded 
          by duties on rum and slaves. After suffering from one fire that was 
          extinguished by a black slave, who was given his freedom for this act, 
          the church completely burned in 1835. The current St. Philip's was constructed 
          from 1835 to 1838 by architect Joseph Hyde, while the steeple, designed 
          by E.B. White, was added a decade later.</p>
        <p> Hyde's design for the church incorporated some of the feature's of 
          the former building, as the vestry proposed, while introducing new elements. 
          St. Philip's, like the earlier church, extends into the center of Church 
          Street, following the contemporary practice of parish churches in England. 
          While planning for St. Philip's, the city proposed widening the street. 
          A persuasive argument was made by the vestry that a steeple was more 
          ornamental than a street. Compromising, the church was built slightly 
          to the east, while the street curves around the projecting tower and 
          steeple. A unique feature of the church's exterior are three separate 
          Tuscan porticoes, one on each of its Church Street facades. Hyde added 
          Roman columns and entablatures to the interior, as well as high Corinthian 
          arcades and a chancel. The chancel was damaged during the Civil War, 
          when St. Philip's steeple was used for siting during Union bombardment 
          of the city. Bells once encased in the steeple were melted for Confederate 
          cannon. 
        <p> 
        <p>Many prominent people are buried in the graveyard, which is divided 
          into two parts. The western yard was initially set aside for the burial 
          of "strangers and transient white persons," but church members were 
          later buried there. Several colonial Governors and five Episcopal bishops 
          are buried here, as well as John C. Calhoun (former Vice President of 
          the United States), Rawlins Lowndes (President of South Carolina in 
          1778-79), and Dubose Heyward (author and playwright). The view of Church 
          Street punctuated by St. Philip's remains one of Charleston's most photographed 
          spots. </p>

          Street Theatre </font></font></font></p>
        <p>An essential part of the streetscape of Church Street, the Dock Street 
          Theatre is Charleston's last surviving hotel from the antebellum period. 
          The silhouette of its wrought iron balcony against the spire of <a href="#stp">St. 
          Philip's</a> church may be the single most photographed spot in the 
          city. The main portion of the building was constructed around 1809 as 
          Planter's Hotel. The hotel was built by Alexander Calder and his wife, 
          who did so by renovating several pre-existing buildings at the site. 
          The main entrance may not have been built until 1855 by J.W. Gamble.</p>
        <p> The hotel was used extensively by planters from the midlands of South 
          Carolina, who traveled to Charleston during horse-racing season. It 
          was noted for its wonderful food and drinks during this era, and the 
          South's famous Planter's Punch may have originated here. Guests to the 
          hotel passed through the recessed porch with brownstone columns, into 
          the lobby, and up a grand staircase that ascended to a drawing room. 
          While much of the interior has been altered, these elements of the antebellum 
          hotel remain and were adapted in subsequent uses of the building. A 
          series of additions to the hotel throughout the 19th and 20th centuries 
          can be easily identified by differences in brick coloration. 
        <p> 
        <p>The Dock Street Theatre also relates the story of Charleston's theater 
          history. In the 1930s, the building was restored by the City of Charleston 
          as a Works Progress Administration project. During this project, a large 
          section was constructed behind the hotel containing a stage and auditorium 
          characteristic of the 18th century. The renovated building took the 
          name of a 1730s theater which stood on the Queen Street (formerly Dock 
          Street) side of the property. This theater is said to have been the 
          first building built specifically for theatrical performances in America. 
          Planter's Hotel occasionally housed one of the city's theatrical troupes, 
          which performed at the nearby New Theatre during the mid-19th century. 
          The most notable actor of this troupe was Junius Brutus Booth. Booth 
          was the patriarch of an outstanding family of actors, which included 
          John Wilkes Booth, President Lincoln's assassin. Junius Booth, who stayed 
          at the Planter's Hotel, allegedly tried to kill his manager here in 
          1838. Today the Dock Street Theatre is home to the Charleston Stage 
          Company, a community theater group, and houses the city's Cultural Affairs 
          office as well as The City Gallery, an exhibition space for local artists.

          Huguenot Church</font></font></font> </p>
        <p>he French Huguenot Church, a National Historic Landmark, is the third 
          church to be constructed on this site. Completed in 1845, it was the 
          first Gothic Revival building constructed in Charleston, and is an excellent 
          example of the versatility of local architect Edward Brickell White. 
          White had recently completed very different Greek and Roman Doric buildings 
          in Charleston. The stucco over brick Huguenot church is ornamented with 
          windows, buttresses, and decorative details typical of the Gothic Revival. 
          The use of iron for many of these decorative details was unusual, but 
          reflects the difficulty of obtaining carved stonework during the antebellum 
          period in Charleston. Today it remains unaltered, even the clear glass 
          windows are original. </p>
        <p> 
        The first church of this denomination was built in 1687, but detonated 
        in 1796 to create a fire break for a blaze raging through the neighborhood. 
        A second church was built in 1800. Services were timed with the tides 
        to accommodate those arriving by boat from the nearby plantations. In 
        1823, the church was closed due to declining membership. 
        <p> Huguenot descendants revived the congregation in 1844 and the second 
          church was torn down to make way for the current building. For most 
          of the 20th century, the church was used for periodic services sponsored 
          by the Huguenot Society of South Carolina, for organ recitals, and weddings. 
          Today's active congregation, reestablished in 1983, is the only French 
          Calvinist congregation in the United States.

        <p>The Old Slave Mart, located on one of Charleston's few remaining cobblestone 
          streets, is the only known extant building used as a slave auction gallery 
          in South Carolina. Once part of a complex of buildings, the Slave Mart 
          building is the only structure to remain. When it was first constructed 
          in 1859, the open ended building was referred to as a shed, and used 
          the walls of the German Fire Hall to its west to support the roof timbers. 
          Slave auctions were held inside. The interior was one large room with 
          a 20-foot ceiling, while the front facade was more impressive with its 
          high arch, octagonal pillars and a large iron gate. </p>
        <p> 
        During the antebellum period, Charleston served as a center of commercial 
        activity for the South's plantation economy, which depended heavily upon 
        slaves as a source of labor. Customarily in Charleston, slaves were sold 
        on the north side of the <a href="#exc">Exchange Building</a> (then the 
        Custom House). An 1856 city ordinance prohibited this practice of public 
        sales, resulting in a number of sales rooms, yards, or marts along Chalmers, 
        State and Queen Streets. One of these belonged to Thomas Ryan, an alderman 
        and former sheriff. Ryan's Mart, now the Old Slave Mart, occupied the 
        land between Chalmers and Queen Street, and contained three additional 
        buildings--a four-story brick tenement building with offices and "barracoon" 
        (slave jail in Portugese) where slaves were held before sales, a kitchen 
        and a morgue. Before the construction of the shed, sales were held in 
        the tenement building or in the yard. Another auction master, Z.B. Oakes, 
        purchased the property in 1859 and applied for a permit to insert brick 
        trusses for the roof of the shed into the adjacent Fire Hall. When sales 
        were held in the shed, slaves stood on auction tables, three feet high 
        and ten feet long, placed lengthwise so slaveowners could pass by them 
        during the auction. The building was used for this purpose only a short 
        time before the defeat of the South in the Civil War led to the end of 
        slavery. 
        <p> Around 1878, the Slave Mart was renovated into a two-story tenement 
          dwelling. In 1938, the property was purchased by Miriam B. Wilson, who 
          turned the site into a museum of African American history, arts and 
          crafts.

        <p>The building that now houses the German Friendly Society was constructed 
          around 1829. It originally housed a Bible depository, a use which reflects 
          Charleston's response to the evangelical movement of the early 19th 
          century. When first complete, the three-story brick building had a hipped 
          roof with a square cupola. Although this cupola was removed, the building 
          today retains many of its original features. </p>
        <p> In 1882 the Carolina Art Association purchased the Bible depository 
          for its headquarters. For several decades the building housed the beginnings 
          of the association's art collection. In 1904, the association moved 
          to its newly constructed headquarters at 135 Meeting Street, now the 
          Gibbs Memorial Art Gallery. 
        <p> 
        <p>The German Friendly Society, later the Arion Society, purchased the 
          building for its headquarters in 1942. Founded by members of <a href="#stj">St. 
          John's Lutheran Church</a> in 1766, the German Friendly Society gave 
          assistance to new immigrants and aid to orphans and widows. The Society 
          meets here weekly, and while membership is limited to 175 people, it 
          is not restricted to persons of German ancestry. The building contains 
          a collection of artifacts that depict more than 200 years of the Society's 
          history, as well as portraits of past officers, the earliest of whom 
          were distinguished Revolutionaries. The original Society hall was located 
          at 27 Archdale Street until 1864, when it burned in a fire believed 
          to have been started by a Federal shell. The German Friendly Society

          Building </font></font></font></p>
        <p>
        <p>The Fireproof Building, a National Historic Landmark, was the most 
          fire protected building at the time of its construction in 1827. Aptly 
          named for this architectural feature, the building was originally called 
          the Charleston District Record Building. It is now believed to be the 
          oldest building of fireproof construction in the United States. The 
          Fireproof Building is also characteristic of the work of Robert Mills, 
          the first native-born American to be trained as an architect, and a 
          Charleston native. He worked with other important early American architects 
          such as Thomas Jefferson, as a draftsman for Monticello, and Benjamin 
          Latrobe, engineering the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Mills was responsible 
          for the <a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc72.htm">Washington 
          Monument</a> and many public buildings throughout the State and nation. 
        </p>
        <p> 
        The Fireproof Building was constructed in a simple Greek Doric style, 
        with minimal ornamentation, and conveys a sense of order and serenity. 
        Because the building was designed to store public records safely, no flammable 
        materials were used in its construction. The building consists primarily 
        of solid masonry, with window sashes and shutters of iron. The high columnar 
        porticoes on an arcaded basement and the triple windows are typical of 
        Mills. Inside, an oval hall contains a cantilevered stone staircase, lit 
        by a cupola. Of such sound construction, the Fireproof Building survived 
        the 1886 earthquake unharmed, except for the exterior stairs. Currently 
        the building is the headquarters for the South Carolina Historical Society, 
        a private non-profit organization founded in 1856.

          Hall</font></font></font></p>
        <p>Hibernian Hall, a National Historic Landmark, was built in 1840 to 
          provide a meeting place for the Hibernian Society, an Irish benevolent 
          organization founded in 1801. The Hall is the only extant building associated 
          with the National Democratic Convention of 1860, one of the most critical 
          political assemblies in this nation's history. Hibernian Hall served 
          as the convention headquarters for the faction supporting Stephen A. 
          Douglas. It was hoped that Douglas would bridge the gap between the 
          northern and southern delegates on the issue of extending slavery to 
          the territories. The first floor of the Hall was used for meetings, 
          while the second floor was filled with hundreds of cots for the delegates. 
          The convention disintegrated no candidate was able to summon a two-thirds 
          majority vote. This divisiveness resulted in a split in the Democratic 
          party, and the election of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate.</p>
        <p>Hibernian Hall was the first semi-public building of pure Greek style 
          to be built in the city, and the only building in Charleston designed 
          by architect Thomas U. Walter of Philadelphia. Walter's design included 
          an Ionic pediment which collapsed in the earthquake of 1886 and was 
          replaced by a Corinthian pediment with brackets and a center circular-arched 
          window. The dignified exterior of the Hall does not allude to the flamboyant 
          ballroom and double stairhall within. The Irish harp carved in the panel 
          above the main door and within the iron gates, as well as a stone from 
          Ireland's Giant's Causeway, reflect the ethnic heritage of the Hall's 
          founders. Christopher Werner, one of Charleston's foremost ironworkers, 
          is responsible for the Hall's gates. </p>
        <p> The Hibernian Society continues to meet regularly, holding annual 
          elections, alternating each year between a Roman Catholic and Protestant 
          president. The Hall still serves as the location for many events, including 
          an annual St. Patrick's Day celebration, society balls and other brilliant 
          social occasions.

          County Courthouse</font></font></font>
        <p>The Charleston County Courthouse is one of the most important buildings 
          in the state. First built in 1753 as the provincial capitol for the 
          colony of South Carolina, the building was reconstructed in 1792 and 
          used for the Charleston district courts. The original Statehouse building 
          was two stories high with an elaborate lobby and grand staircase. Provincial 
          court met on the groundfloor, the Commons House of Assembly and the 
          Royal Governor's Council Chamber met on the second floor. The Statehouse 
          was part of the original Civic Square planned for in the Grand Modell 
          of Charles Town, now known as "Four Corners of the Law," at the central 
          intersection of Broad and Meeting Streets. Architecturally and geographically 
          the building signaled to Charleston's citizens and visitors the city's 
          importance within the British colonies. From the second story balcony 
          overlooking Meeting Street, great affairs of state were announced to 
          the public, including the first reading of the Declaration of Independence 
          in South Carolina. </p>
        <p> 
        The original building burned during the Constitutional Ratification Convention 
        of 1788, leaving only the foundation, walls and doorways. Anxious to retain 
        their position in the new state government, Charlestonians quickly began 
        reconstruction of the building in a Neoclassical style. Judge William 
        Drayton, an amateur architect, supervised the construction, while James 
        Hoban, architect of the <a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc31.htm">White 
        House</a> may have assisted in its design. By the time of its completion 
        in 1792, Columbia was firmly established as the capital city, and the 
        building became a center for legal activity, housing circuit, state and 
        federal courts as well as the sheriff's offices. A third story was used 
        by the <a href="#cls">Charleston Library Society</a> and Charleston Museum, 
        the oldest museum in the country. 
        <p> Major additions and changes occurred throughout the late 19th and 
          20th centuries, resulting in insensitive alterations to the building. 
          The courthouse was recently  restored to its late 18th-century 
          appearance, and still houses court and county government functions. It is one of more than 1400 historically significant buildings 
          within the Charleston Old and Historic District.

          City Hall </font></font></font> 
        <p>Charleston's City Hall building was constructed between 1800 and 1804 
          in the Adamesque style. In 1800 the City Council conveyed this parcel 
          to the Federal government for the purpose of erecting "an elegant building" 
          that would serve as a branch of The First Bank of the United States. 
          Charleston's branch was one of eight in the country, serving as the 
          Office of Discount and Deposit. The design is attributed to Charlestonian 
          Gabriel Manigault, a gentleman architect credited with introducing the 
          Adamesque style to the city after studying in Europe. City Hall's semi-circular 
          projection on the north side and round basement windows are characteristic 
          features of Manigault. The white marble trim is believed to have originated 
          in Italy before it was cut in Philadelphia. The original red brick walls 
          offered a striking contrast to this marble trim before the walls were 
          covered with stucco in 1882. The building was constructed by local carpenters 
          Edward Magrath and Joseph Nicholson and mason Andrew Gordon. In 1811, 
          the bank's charter was revoked by Congress, after which the property 
          was conveyed back to the City of Charleston and became City Hall in 
          1818. </p>
        <p> 
        This site was originally set aside as a public market within the Civic 
        Square of the Grand Modell, the 17th-century plan of the city. A beef 
        market stood here from 1739 until it was destroyed by fire in 1796. This 
        central intersection is now called "Four Corners of the Law," as the four 
        buildings surrounding it reflect four arms of law--ecclesiastical, state, 
        federal and City Hall's municipal law. 
        <p> The original interior entrance hall was significantly altered in 1839 
          to create additional space on the second floor. In 1882, a new roof 
          was added, the interior completely modified, and the brick stuccoed. 
          The council chamber on the second floor remains the center of city government. 
          City Hall is one of more than 1400 historically significant buildings 
          within the Charleston Old and Historic District.

          Michael's Episcopal Church</font></font></font>
        <p>
        <p>St. Michael's Episcopal Church, a National Historic Landmark, is one 
          of the finest Colonial American churches in the country and the oldest 
          church in Charleston. Although the architect is unknown, the church 
          was built between 1752 and 1761 and resembles 18th-century English pattern 
          book examples widely used throughout the colonies. It is similar in 
          many respects to London's St. Martin-in-the-Fields, designed by James 
          Gibbs. Prominent and elegant features of the two-story stuccoed brick 
          church are its giant classical portico and a 186-foot high massively 
          proportioned steeple. The history of the congregation of St. Michael's 
          is rooted in that of <a href="#stp">St. Philip's Episcopal</a>. The 
          first St. Philip's church stood at this site from approximately 1681 
          to 1727. In 1751, the congregation divided, and the residents of the 
          lower half of the city formed St. Michael's.</p>
        <p> Approximately 15 years after its doors opened, St. Michael's became 
          Charleston's focal point of Colonial resistance to the British. During 
          the Revolutionary period, the church tower was a target for British 
          ship gunners. In the hopes of decreasing it's visibility the white tower 
          was painted black, which made it even more visible against the blue 
          sky. Contributing to the war effort, the lead roof was melted down for 
          bullets. The steeple continued to function as a navigational landmark 
          and observation post during all subsequent major American military conflicts, 
          as well as a fire lookout until the late 19th century.
        <p> 
        <p>St. Michael's has amazingly survived several hurricanes, wars, fires, 
          earthquakes and a cyclone with little alteration to its architecture. 
          When damaged, the church has been carefully restored or reconstructed. 
          The current portico dates to the late 1880s, and is a replica of the 
          original which was damaged in the 1886 earthquake. The interior of the 
          church still retains its traditional 18th-century English design, with 
          a three-sided second story gallery and native cedar box-pews. The pews, 
          including Number 43 used by George Washington in 1791 and General Robert 
          E. Lee in 1861, have recently been restored to their 18th-century finish. 
          St. Michael's bells are among the city's most beloved treasures, imported 
          from England in 1764. During the Revolutionary War the bells were taken 
          to England as a prize of war, but a London merchant purchased and returned 
          them. During the Civil War, they were sent to Columbia, but cracked 
          in a great fire there in 1865. The metal fragments were salvaged and 
          sent to England to be recast in their original moulds and rehung. St. 
          Michael's continues to be a major city landmark, representing ecclesiastical 
          law in its prominent position at the "Four Corners of the Law," originally 
          the Civic Square in the 17th-century plan of the city.</p>

          States Post Office </font></font></font></p>
        <p>The United States Post Office and Courthouse was built in 1896 and 
          designed by local architect John Henry Deveraux. An Irish immigrant, 
          Deveraux became a noted architect in Charleston by the late 1860s. His 
          Renaissance Revival style building with lavish interior is indicative 
          of elaborate public buildings of the late 19th century. Deveraux used 
          grey granite from Winnsboro, South Carolina, a square corner tower, 
          rusticated quoins, and balustraded balconies to create a palatial and 
          imposing exterior. The Post Office occupies the first floor, decorated 
          with carved mahogany woodwork, a marble staircase, brass and ironwork, 
          and stone columns. </p>
        The second floor contains a paneled Victorian courtroom. The Post Office 
        and Courthouse is the most modern building at the intersection of Meeting 
        and Broad Streets, land that was set aside as a Civic Square in the Grand 
        Modell, the 17th-century plan of the city. The intersection is now called 
        "Four Corners of the Law" as the buildings that surround it reflect ecclesiastical, 
        municipal, state, and federal law, with the Post Office representing the 
        latter. 
        <p> Prior to this building's construction, the site contained a mid-18th-century 
          guardhouse (police station), treasury building, and the Charleston Club. 
          The guardhouse standing at the time of the 1886 earthquake was damaged 
          so severely it was demolished. In 1983, a large annex was constructed 
          south of the building; another to the west was begun in 1997, after 
          years of planning and debate. The building still functions as it did 
          originally, used as the downtown branch of the post office and federal 
          district court.

        <p>
        <p>The South Carolina Society Hall is considered one of Charleston's most 
          valuable Adamesque buildings. Built in 1804, the Hall was designed by 
          Charlestonian Gabriel Manigault, a gentleman architect who introduced 
          the Adamesque style to the city after studying in Europe. Manigault's 
          design for the Society's headquarters, of which he was a member, consisted 
          of a two-story brick building on a very high basement, covered with 
          stucco. The first floor contained three rooms used for billiards, a 
          small school the society operated, and quarters for the schoolmaster. 
          A large meeting room and ballroom occupied the second floor. The meeting 
          room also contained a small musician's gallery and a decorative Palladian 
          window, while the ballroom was ornamented with a Neoclassical canopy. 
          In 1825, the portico with Doric and Ionic orders, designed by prominent 
          local architect Frederick Wesner, was added along with the brownstone 
          stairs and iron railings. As a result of damage to the building during 
          the Civil War and the 1886 earthquake the interior was renovated during 
          the Victorian period.</p>
        <p>
        <p>The South Carolina Society was first organized in 1737, mainly by French 
          Huguenot businessmen and artisans. It was originally named "The Two 
          Bit Club," as members agreed to weekly dues of two bits, or 15 pence, 
          to the relief of a French Huguenot tavern owner. Later the benevolent 
          association established schools for orphans and indigent children. The 
          Society now donates scholarships to the <a href="#col">College of Charleston</a>. 
          The Society still uses the Hall, along with the St. Andrew's Society.

          Scots Presbyterian Church</font></font></font></font></font></p>
        <p>First Scots Presbyterian Church, the fifth oldest church in Charleston, 
          was constructed in 1814. Its design was perhaps inspired by <a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/baltimore/b20.htm">St. 
          Mary's Cathedral</a> in Baltimore, Maryland designed by Benjamin Latrobe. 
          Latrobe was the first professionally trained American architect, best 
          known for designing the <a href="/wash/dc76.htm">United States Capitol</a>. 
          The massive brick Presbyterian Church has walls that are three feet 
          thick and covered with stucco. Twin towers rise above a columned portico. 
          Reflecting the heritage of the congregation, the seal of the Church 
          of Scotland is displayed in the stained glass window over the main entrance, 
          and the decorative wrought iron grilles contain thistles, the symbol 
          of Scotland. First Scots replaced the congregation's first church, a 
          frame building previously located in the southeast corner of the graveyard. 
          The graveyard contains more than 50 stones that date earlier than 1800.</p>
        <p> 
        <p>The congregation of First Scots dates to 1731 when 12 Scottish families 
          withdrew from the Meeting House, located at the site where the <a href="#cir">Circular 
          Congregational Church</a> now stands. These members formed Scot's Kirk 
          or the Scotch Meeting House, and were associated with the Presbytery 
          of Charleston and later the Presbyterian Church of the United States. 
          Their first building was finished in 1734 and used for worship until 
          the current church was built. Unique silver and pewter tokens were used 
          for admission to Communion. During both the Revolutionary War and Civil 
          War services were not held. Like many other buildings in Charleston, 
          the church was damaged by the 1886 earthquake, as well as a hurricane 
          the year before. Presbyterians from the North assisted in the restoration 
          of First Scots, and two other Presbyterian churches in Charleston damaged 
          by these natural disasters. Several memorial windows remain that were 
          placed after the earthquake. Recently an English bell made in 1814, 
          the year of the church's construction, was hung in the north tower, 
          replacing the original which had been given to the Confederate army 
          for cannons. First Scots Presbyterian is one of more than 1400 historically

        <p>The Citizens and Southern National Bank of South Carolina is the second 
          oldest building constructed as a bank in the United States and reflects 
          Charleston's financial and institutional history, as well as commercial 
          architecture of late 18th century. Constructed in 1798 for the Bank 
          of South Carolina, the two-story building is T-shaped, with a pedimented 
          projecting center pavilion and refined architectural details. Keystone 
          arches, window lintels, and a belt course are all executed in white 
          marble. </p>
        <p> In 1802 the bank was the target of a inventive but unsuccessful robbery 
          plot. A man by the name of Withers entered a drain near the bank, and 
          began tunneling toward the bank's vault. He remained underground for 
          three months as he dug, supplied with food and water by an accomplice 
          who carelessly led to the plot's discovery.
        <p>In 1835 the building was purchased by the <a href="#cls">Charleston 
          Library Society </a>, thought to be the third oldest library in the 
          country. During their occupancy, the building was damaged by the 1886 
          earthquake and received a Victorian roof. After the Library Society 
          relocated in 1914, the Charleston Chamber of Commerce purchased the 
          building. In 1966 the building finally returned to its original use 
          when purchased by the Citizens and Southern Bank. This institution removed 
          the Victorian roof, renovated the interior and replicated the original 
          iron fencing. Currently the bank building is used as a private office.</p>

        <p>The South Carolina National Bank of Charleston is one of the most important 
          buildings on Broad Street, South Carolina's oldest commercial street. 
          It has been in continuous use as a bank since it was constructed in 
          1817. In the early 19th century, Charleston ranked highly enough as 
          a commercial center to have a branch of the Second Bank of the United 
          States, whose charter was drawn up by John C. Calhoun, the State's preeminent 
          statesman. This financial institution was the second attempt at a national 
          bank; The First Bank of the United States had also established a branch 
          in Charleston, now <a href="#cch">City Hall</a>. This Second Bank branch, 
          that of Discount and Deposit, was the only bank in the city equipped 
          to handle the international transactions so crucial to the rice trade, 
          a mainstay of the Lowcountry economy. Stucco covers the masonry walls 
          of the two story building. The smooth, clean exterior is accentuated 
          by simple arched and rectangular window and door openings. A gold leaf 
          eagle still adorns the gable of the front of the bank, as it has since 
          1817. The lobby, also in continuous use since the bank's opening, features 
          more elaborately carved details, and has been altered only with the 
          addition of lights and modern teller windows. </p>
        <p> 
        <p>The newly chartered Bank of Charleston purchased the building in 1836, 
          shortly after the Second Bank failed following the withdrawl of all 
          government deposits by President Andrew Jackson. By 1848 the Bank of 
          Charleston became a regional power with affiliates in Georgia, Alabama, 
          Florida, and Louisiana. The building was extended to the north in 1856 
          and the Board of Director's Room added. It is an elaborate room with 
          coved ceiling, pilasters with Corinthian capitals, and marbelized details 
          (wood painted to simulate tan and black marble). The bank managed to 
          survive financially during the Civil War and Reconstruction, despite 
          a $1.5 million loan to the Confederacy, and by 1887 had recovered sufficiently 
          to become a Federal Depository. In 1926 the Bank of Charleston merged 
          with local banks in Greenville and Columbia to form the South Carolina 
          National Bank, which in turn was absorbed by Wachovia in the mid-1990s.

          and Exchange Bank</font></font></font></p>
        <p>The Farmers and Exchange Bank, a National Historic Landmark, is perhaps 
          the only example of Moorish Revival architecture in America that evolved 
          from one aspect of English Regency architecture and the only Moorish 
          Revival building in Charleston. Designed by Edward D. Jones and Francis 
          D. Lee, both notable Charleston architects, the building was completed 
          in 1854. Typical of the eclectic Moorish style are horseshoe arches 
          and the banded facade, produced by using two different varieties of 
          brownstone from New Jersey and Connecticut. Its design is thought to 
          have been influenced by illustrations in Washington Irving's <u>The 
          Alhambra</u>, a volume which was published around the time the building 
          was constructed. The exotic and romantic world of Moorish Spain was 
          popularized by Irving in this book.</p>
        <p> 
        <p>Inside the flat-roofed building was a high skylighted banking room. 
          Spanish motifs are seen in this area as well in the elaborate plaster 
          decorations. In contrast the rear wing of the building is built in a 
          more conventional Classical Revival style. The building was threatened 
          by demolition to become a parking lot until it was purchased and restored 
          in 1970. In the early 1990s the building was rehabilitated for use as

          and Provost Building </font></font></font> </p>
        <p>The Exchange and Provost, a National Historic Landmark, was a pivotal 
          building in colonial Charleston, where many significant events of the 
          American Revolution and early Federal period occurred. As Charleston 
          became the South's largest port, the Exchange and Custom House was built 
          from 1767 to 1771 for the expanding shipping industry, but also served 
          as a public market and meeting place. After a protest meeting against 
          the Tea Act, confiscated tea was stored here in 1774. The Provincial 
          Congress of South Carolina met here the following year. During the Revolutionary 
          War, the British used the building for barracks and the basement as 
          a military prison. The State Legislature met here in 1788, after the 
          <a href="#ccc">Statehouse</a> was destroyed. When George Washington 
          visited Charleston on his southern tour of 1791, a grand ball was held 
          for him on the second floor.</p>
        <p> 
        The symmetrical Georgian style building is two stories with an elevated 
        basement and hipped roof. The central projecting pavilion on the main 
        side of the building and tall Palladian windows are typical classical 
        details of the Georgian period. Originally the building fronted the harbor, 
        but during the past two centuries several blocks have been created by 
        landfill between the Exchange and the water. In the 19th century the building 
        was used mainly as a post office and customhouse. Port business was no 
        longer conducted at the Exchange after a new United States Custom House 
        was completed several blocks north of the Exchange in 1879. The Exchange 
        was badly damaged by Union artillery fire during the Civil War, and by 
        the 1886 earthquake. 
        <p> In 1913, the building was deeded to the Daughters of the American 
          Revolution (DAR) to be preserved as a historical monument. Since 1917 
          the second floor rooms have been used as offices for various federal 
          agencies, while the main floor rooms serve as a meeting place for the 
          DAR. The basement has been restored and is exhibited to the public as 
          the British Provost Dungeon.

          Baptist Church</font></font></font></p>
        <p>First Baptist Church, often referred to as the "Mother Church of Southern 
          Baptists," is the oldest Baptist Church in the South. The church was 
          designed by Robert Mills and dedicated in 1822. Robert Mills considered 
          the First Baptist Church to be "the best specimen of correct taste in 
          architecture of all the modern buildings in this city." Mills described 
          the building as "purely Greek in its style," although it is more accurately 
          described as a Georgian Composition. The trim Doric portico topped with 
          triglyphed entablature and pediment are decidedly Greek in style, however, 
          they are juxtaposed Roman arches and Tuscan columns. </p>
        <p>The Church was founded in 1682 and originally organized in Kittery, 
          Maine by the Rev. William Screven. Due to persecution, the Church remained 
          in Kittery for only one year. In 1683 the Baptists relocated to South 
          Carolina. Upon arriving in South Carolina, the Baptists first settled 
          in Somerton, on the Cooper River near Charleston. The first Church meetings 
          were held in the King Street home of William Chapman. In 1699, the present 
          lot was donated to the Church by William Elliot and a frame building 
          was constructed. During the Revolutionary War, the Church was seized 
          by the British troops and used as a storage facility for salt beef and 
          other provisions. The British commander, Lord Cornwallis, "feared the 
          prayers of the young Baptist minister more than the armies of Marion 
          and Sumter." The "young Baptist minister" he spoke of was the Rev. Richard 
          Furman, founder of Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina: 
          the first Baptist college in the South. Two other pastors of the church, 
          the Rev. Dr. Basil Manly and the Rev. Dr. James Petigru Boyce, founded 
          the Southern Baptists Seminary, currently the largest in the world. 
          Today, the First Baptist Church remains an active congregation and is 
          one of more than 1400 historically significant buildings within the 
          Charleston Old and Historic District.. </p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#660099"><font size="5"><font size="6"><a name="sum"></a>Fort 
          Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Monument</font></font></font></p>
        <p>From the time of the earliest European settlements until the end of 
          World War II, coastal fortifications guarded the harbors and shores 
          of the United States. At Fort Moultrie, two centuries of seacoast defense 
          is told through a unique plan of restoration. Five sections of the fort 
          and two outlying areas, each mounting typical weapons, represent a different 
          historical period of Fort Moultrie. In its two centuries of history, 
          Fort Moultrie has defended Charleston Harbor twice. During the Revolutionary 
          War, the fort was still incomplete when it was attacked by a British 
          fleet on June 28, 1776. After a nine-hour battle, the ships were forced 
          to retire. Charleston was saved from British occupation and the fort 
          was named for its commander, William Moultrie. Nearly a century later, 
          during the Civil War, Federal forces bombarded Charleston's forts from 
          land and sea for nearly two years. Though the masonry wall of Forts 
          Sumter and Fort Moultire crumbled under the shelling, both forts were 
          able to hold back the Union attacks. Despite its lack of use in combat 
          since, Fort Moultrie was maintained until 1947 to provide a ready and 
          inexpensive deterrent to any prospective enemy.</p>
        <p> 
        <p>Fort Sumter was one of a series of coastal fortifications built by 
          the United States after the War of 1812. Begun in 1829 and named for 
          South Carolina Revolutionary War patriot Thomas Sumter, the fort was 
          still unfinished when Major Robert Anderson first occupied it with his 
          85-man Federal garrison in 1860. The base foundation of rock and granite 
          material supported a massive five-sided, three story fort of 2.4 acres. 
          Fort Sumter was one of few forts in the South that remained in Federal 
          control during the immediate months after South Carolina and six other 
          state seceded from the Union. As Anderson refused to evacuate, Fort 
          Sumter became the site of the opening battle of the Civil War on April 
          12, 1861. For 34 hours Confederate forces assailed the fort, with limited 
          return fire from Sumter with nine or ten casemate guns. Anderson surrendered 
          and miraculously no one on either side had been killed. During the Federal 
          bombardment of the Charleston harbor from 1863 to 1865, Fort Sumter 
          was badly damaged. In the 1870's, the fort was rehabilitated by partially 
          rebuilding the outer walls. It served mainly as a lighthouse station 
          until 1897. A massive concrete battery was built in the center of the 
          fort in 1898, a response to the Spanish-American War. A small garrison 
          manned the battery's rifles during World War I, and the Army did not 
          use Fort Sumter again as a military establishment until World War II. 
          Since 1948 Fort Sumter has been recognized as a National Monument and 
          administered and interpreted by the National Park Service for the numerous 
          tourists who visit it every year. </p>

          Pinckney National Historic Site</font></font></font><br clear=all>
        </p>
        <p>The Charles Pinckney National Historic Site is dedicated to interpreting 
          the life of Charles Pinckney's, his role in the development of the United 
          States Constitution, his plantation, and the transition of colonial 
          America to a young nation. Designated as a National Historic Landmark, 
          the 28 acres of this site comprise only a small portion of the large 
          715 acre rice planation that Charles Pinckney inherited from his father 
          in 1782, known as Snee Farm. No standing structures remain from the 
          time during which Pinckney lived at Snee Farm. The present house, built 
          of native cypress and pine in the 1820's, is a fine example of a tidewater 
          cottage once common throughout the coastal areas of the Carolinas and 
          Virginia.
        <p> 
        The science of archeology has contributed greatly to what is known about 
        the plantation, as most of Pinckney's papers were destroyed by the Charleston 
        fire of 1861 where he resided most of the year. Archeologists have identified 
        the locations of ponds and fields used for growing indigo, rice and cotton, 
        the Pinckney well, the plantation kitchen, two slave cabins, and foundations 
        for the buildings that may have been the Pinckney's plantation house and 
        overseer's house. Snee Farm was Pinckney's country estate and the favorite 
        among his seven plantations. Pinckney had been born into the Charleston 
        elite, as the son of a wealthy planter and attorney. His career of public 
        service began in 1779, when at the age of 21 he became a member of the 
        South Carolina General Assembly. He was selected as a delegate to Congress 
        in 1784, and was one of four representatives from South Carolina at the 
        Constitutional Convention. Throughout his active political career Pinckney 
        served four terms as South Carolina governor, and a U.S. Senator and Representative. 
        Leading Thomas Jefferson's campaign for the Presidency in South Carolina, 
        Pinckney was rewarded with the position of Ambassador to Spain. He is 
        buried at <a href="#stp">St. Philip's Episcopal Church</a> in Charleston. 
        <p> Snee Farm continued to be a working plantation well into the 20th 
          century. Most of its labor force were African Americans, first as slaves, 
          then as tenants or sharecroppers after the abolition of slavery. Today, 
          interpretive exhibits highlight Pinckney's life, the history of the 
          plantation, as well as the contribtuions of African-Americans in the 
          development of farm. Archeology is also emphasized as a important means 
          to uncover the history of a site.
