                    A dump truck driver had to be extricated from the cab of the truck he was driving after he lost control of the truck and it crashed through a concrete block wall and then rammed through a house on the city’s northwest side early Monday afternoon.&nbsp;No one was home when the incident occurred.&nbsp;The driver was taken to the UMC Trauma unit with non-life threatening injuries.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Firefighters responded at 2:31 p.m. Monday to a house at 11012 Calder Ave which is near the intersection of the 215 and Far Hills Drive.&nbsp;The back of the house runs along Far Hills Drive.&nbsp;The truck lost control and rammed through a concrete block wall which runs along the sidewalk beside Far Hills Drive and then into the back of the 2-story wood frame/stucco house, coming to rest in the family room and kitchen of the house.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>The truck did extensive damage to the house and severed a natural gas line that fed a fireplace which once sat where the truck was sitting.&nbsp;The driver was trapped inside the cab, between the driver’s front seat and the main beam between the first and second floor of the house.&nbsp;Firefighters only had a couple of inches to work his head through the tight space.&nbsp; Several units were dispatched to the scene because firefighters at first thought that extra heavy extrication equipment would be needed to free the man and also to prevent a possible collapse of the second floor.<BR><BR>In approximately 13 minutes after arriving on scene, firefighters freed the man.&nbsp;He was taken to UMC Trauma complaining of back and neck pain.<BR><BR>The cause of the accident is under investigation by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. The Las Vegas Building and Safety Department said the house was too badly damaged to be occupied.<BR>
