<p>
On February 15, 2007, the Alcoa Police Department investigated a fatal accident that occurred at 2734 Alcoa Highway. The vehicles involved were a 1993 Ford Explorer, driven by a Nicholas D. Hannah, 23, of Mutton Hollow Road, Maryville, Tenn. and a 2007 Buick Lucerne, driven by Stanley VerPloeg, 82. VerPloeg and his passenger, Virginia VerPloeg, 81, are from West Des Moines, Iowa. Through the course of the investigation, it was found that both vehicles were traveling northbound on Alcoa Highway. The Buick Lucerne was attempting to enter the cross-over to make a U-turn from the right lane of travel. This improper turn was the proximate cause of the accident. The driver of the Ford Explorer was traveling in the left lane when the Buick attempted to make the U-turn. The Ford Explorer struck the Buick Lucerne in the driver side doors causing a fatal injury to Mr. VerPloeg. Mr. VerPloeg was trapped inside the vehicle and extricated by the Alcoa Fire Department. He was taken to Blount Memorial Hospital. Mrs. VerPloeg was transported to the University of Tennessee Medical Center where she was treated and released with minor injuries. Mr. Hannah was transported to Blount Memorial Hospital where he was treated and released with minor injuries. All drivers and passengers in this accident were wearing seatbelts at the time of the accident.
