IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:</span></div>
<br>
<div class="Normal" style='  text-align: center; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt; font-weight: bold;'>SECTION
1.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>The
General Assembly finds and declares as follows:</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(1)
The high and rising cost of natural gas has caused financial hardship on
homeowners, small businesses, and low-income citizens of Georgia;</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(2)
The rising demand for natural gas as a clean-burning fuel source coupled with a
limited supply of natural gas will continue to boost heating and electricity
costs;</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(3)
Elba Island Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal on the Georgia coast is one of the
nation</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
key receiving points for imported natural gas;</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(4)
The provision of an increased diversity of natural gas supplies to Georgia will
offset part of the need for supplies from the Gulf of Mexico and will help
stabilize or lower the price for natural gas in Georgia, helping to create a
favorable energy market for Georgia consumers;</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(5)
More natural gas capacity and supply is necessary to accommodate economic
development and job creation in Georgia;</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(6)
A favorable energy market in Georgia will aid economic development, help attract
new jobs, and help to secure existing jobs;</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(7)
More competition in delivering natural gas will put a downward pressure on
prices which could lead to lower prices for Georgians; and</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(8)
In order to meet the energy demands of Georgians and the rest of this nation and
to benefit the Georgia economy, there is a need to provide means of accessing
and delivering natural gas within this state.</span></div>
<br>
<div class="Normal" style='  text-align: center; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt; font-weight: bold;'>SECTION
2.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>Code
Section 46-4-155 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to
regulation of unbundled services, peaking service, customer services, and
interstate capacity assets with regard to the distribution, storage, and sale of
gas, is amended by adding a new subsection (f) to read as follows:</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><font face='WP Phonetic' size='4'>"</font><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(f)(1)
As used in this subsection, the term:</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:27pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(A)
'LNG' means liquefied natural gas.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:27pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(B)
'Strategic infrastructure asset' means intrastate assets providing access to the
imported liquefied natural gas market through the Elba Island LNG Terminal
facility on the Georgia coast for firm distribution service to retail
customers.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:27pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(C)
'Strategic infrastructure asset cost' means costs that include, but are not
limited to, feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, facility and system
modeling, engineering design and procedure development, permits, utility service
extensions, bidding, material and equipment attainment, site preparation, legal
services, environmental compliance, utility locating, construction, labor,
materials and equipment, project management services, testing, inspections,
community outreach, public meetings, land rights attainment, erosion control,
land surveys, safety and fire protection, site remediation, and
security.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:27pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(2)(A)
The electing distribution company may file a strategic infrastructure asset
proposal with the commission when the construction of such additional assets
will provide for at least two of the following:</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:36pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(i)
A lower total proposal cost compared to the cost of the best alternative
proposal using only interstate capacity assets to meet its forecast system
requirements;</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:36pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(ii)
Greater reliability of delivery of gas supply to and within its system for firm
distribution service to retail customers;</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:36pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(iii)
A more economical gas supply for retail customers by providing access to a
greater diversity of gas supply sources; or</span></div>
<br>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:36pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(iv)
The overall best interest of the natural gas consumers in the
state.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:27pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(B)
No strategic infrastructure asset proposal may be filed with or approved by the
commission unless the construction of such additional asset will provide for a
net financial savings to natural gas
customers</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>
gas bills in this state such that the overall savings to the customer are
greater than the cost recovery of the strategic infrastructure
asset.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(3)
Any such strategic infrastructure asset proposal shall include such reasonable
detail regarding the proposed strategic infrastructure assets as the commission
may require including a description of the strategic infrastructure to be
constructed, acquired, or modified; an explanation of the need for such
strategic infrastructure investment; the projected cost of the infrastructure
investment; and the projected schedule for completion.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(4)
Not less than 30 days after the filing of a strategic infrastructure asset
proposal by an electing distribution company, the commission shall commence a
public hearing on the proposal.  The electing distribution
company</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
testimony shall be under oath and shall, with any corrections thereto,
constitute the electing distribution
company</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
affirmative case.  At any hearing conducted pursuant to this paragraph, the
burden of proof to show that the strategic infrastructure asset proposal meets
the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be upon the electing
distribution company.  For the commission to approve any strategic
infrastructure asset proposal, it must find that the requirements of paragraph
(2) of this subsection are met.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(5)
Following such a hearing, the commission shall either approve or deny the
strategic infrastructure asset proposal and shall not modify the electing
distribution
company</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
proposal related to such strategic infrastructure assets.  Should the commission
fail or refuse to issue an order by the one hundred twentieth day after the
electing distribution
company</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
filing which either approves or disapproves the strategic infrastructure asset
proposal filed by the electing distribution company, the strategic
infrastructure asset proposal filed by the electing distribution company shall
thereupon be deemed approved by operation of law.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(6)
After the approval of a strategic infrastructure asset proposal, the commission
shall not in a subsequent proceeding disapprove the strategic infrastructure
assets which were previously approved, and the commission shall provide for cost
recovery of such strategic infrastructure assets separate and apart from the
electing distribution
company</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
base rates as more fully described in paragraph (7) of this
subsection.</span></div>
<br>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(7)
The electing distribution company shall file with the commission the estimated
total cost of any strategic infrastructure asset proposal with reasonable
supporting information for said estimate as may be required by the commission. 
Any order approving a strategic infrastructure asset proposal shall include cost
recovery for the electing distribution company of the actual total cost of the
strategic infrastructure assets pursuant to the provisions set forth in this
subsection absent a showing of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a
material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct.  The electing distribution
company shall be entitled to recover 100 percent of the actual total strategic
infrastructure asset costs not to exceed the estimated total cost filed with the
commission by more than 15 percent.  If the actual total cost exceeds the
estimated total cost by an amount that does not exceed 15 percent of the
estimate filed with the commission, the electing distribution company shall file
a report with the commission detailing the reasons for exceeding the estimate. 
In such cases, the commission may disallow such cost in excess of the filed
estimated total cost only upon a finding by the commission that such cost in
excess of the estimate was the result of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose
a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct.  In such cases, the burden
of proof shall be on the party challenging recovery of such costs by the
electing distribution company.  If such actual total strategic infrastructure
asset cost exceeds the estimated total cost filed with the commission by more
than 15 percent, then the electing distribution company shall be entitled to
recover the amount that exceeds the filed estimated total cost by more than 15
percent only if such costs are shown by the electing distribution company to
have been reasonable and prudent.  The commission may require the electing
distribution company to periodically file reports with the commission detailing
the actual total cost incurred for approved strategic infrastructure assets;
provided, however, said reports shall not be required to be filed more
frequently than every 60 days.  The commission shall provide for cost recovery
by a monthly strategic infrastructure charge to the marketers that shall not be
placed in and that shall be maintained separate and apart from the base rates of
the electing distribution company.  Each marketer may identify the strategic
infrastructure asset cost as a separate item on a
customer</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
monthly bill.  Should a marketer elect to identify such charge, the line item
shall specifically state the purpose of the charge and said charge shall be
collected as provided by law or previous orders of the commission.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' margin-left:18pt; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>(8)
The cost of strategic infrastructure assets shall be recovered by the electing
distribution company upon the completion of the construction based on the net
incremental cost.  The commission shall provide for a recovery mechanism that
shall be in the form of an incremental charge, separate and apart from the then
existing rates of the electing distribution company.  The rate shall be
determined by calculating the electing distribution
company</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
net investment (invested capital less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
deferred income taxes) multiplied by the pre-tax rate of return plus the
incremental operating and maintenance costs associated with the strategic
infrastructure assets.  The return on investment and depreciation used in the
computation of this charge shall be the same as those determined by the
commission in the last fully litigated rate case before the commission by the
electing distribution company.  The cost as estimated of newly proposed
strategic infrastructure assets included in a strategic infrastructure asset
proposal shall not exceed 25 percent of the electing distribution
company</span><span style='font-family: Times New Roman CE; font-size: 13pt;'>&#769;</span><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>s
rate base at the time of the filing of the
proposal.</span><font face='WP Phonetic' size='4'>"</font></div>

<div class="Normal" style='  text-align: center; min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt; font-weight: bold;'>SECTION
3.</span></div>
<div class="Normal" style=' min-height:18pt;'><span style='font-size: 13pt;'>This
Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its
becoming law without such approval.</span></div>
