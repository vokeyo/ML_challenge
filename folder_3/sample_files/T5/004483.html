><td><ul><li>On March 28, 2008, a 33-year-old male volunteer fire fighter (the victim) was fatally injured after the tanker truck he was driving left the roadway and overturned.  The victim was enroute to a structure fire, took an unfamiliar route, and failed to negotiate a 90° curve to the right.  The tanker left the roadway rolling onto the driver's side then slid through a ditch into a row of pine trees crushing the cab.  The victim was extricated by emergency personnel, air-lifted to a local medical center, and later pronounced dead.  NIOSH investigators concluded that, in order to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should: (1) ensure that tankers are driven at a safe and reasonable speed; (2) ensure that fire fighters are familiar with the location of the roads in their coverage areas; (3) consider staffing tankers with a minimum of two fire fighters; (4) consider supplying responding units with maps or verbal directions to incident scenes, using computer aided
 dispatch (CAD) or a global positioning system (GPS) device; and (5) develop oversight of the preventive maintenance program for fire apparatus.  Fire departments and fire service training organizations should: (6) consider additional driver training for fire fighters on safe tanker driving and operations.  Fire departments and fire apparatus manufacturers should: (7) ensure that tankers meet all the requirements of NFPA 1901, Standard for Automotive Fire Apparatus.</li

><td><ul><li>On November 22, 2005, a 28-year-old male volunteer fire fighter (the victim) died while responding to a mutual-aid call for a major grass fire.  The victim was driving the department's tractor trailer (tanker) on a two-lane state highway.  The tanker went off the road, overturned, and came to rest in a field.  The victim was ejected and found lying unresponsive on the roadway.  He was pronounced dead at the scene by the Justice of the Peace.  NIOSH investigators concluded that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:  (1) ensure that water tankers are operated within safe weight restrictions that comply with the specific vehicle characteristics; (2) ensure that all fire apparatus meet the requirements of NFPA 1901 Standard for Automotive Fire Apparatus; (3) ensure that drivers of fire department vehicles receive training at least twice a year on each vehicle that they may be called upon to operate; (4) develop and enforce standard operating
 procedures (SOPs) that require mandatory use of seat belts in all vehicles; and (5) develop a comprehensive apparatus maintenance program that includes regularly scheduled inspections, documentation, and procedures for removing apparatus from service when required.  Additionally, states should consider developing a vehicle inspection and repair program prior to distributing surplus military vehicles to the fire service.</li

><td><ul><li>On August 6, 2005, a 23-year-old male career fire fighter (the victim) died after he was ejected from the open cab of an engine during a crash.  The crew was responding without lights or sirens to a flooded residence in a reserve engine being used by the crew while the apparatus they regularly used was being serviced.  The engine was traveling at approximately 45 miles per hour in a heavy rainstorm when the driver lost control.  The vehicle left the road, traveled down an embankment and struck two trees before coming to a rest on the roadway below.  The engine's auxiliary braking system (engine brake) was engaged at the time of the incident.  The victim was found lying unresponsive under the running board on the passenger's side of the vehicle.  The victim was found to have lacerations around his mid-section and no pulse.  The victim was removed and transported to an area hospital where he was later pronounced dead.  The driver/operator and another fire fighter were treated on
 the scene before being transported to the County hospital for additional treatment.  NIOSH investigators concluded that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:  (1) ensure that drivers are trained to carefully consider the use of auxiliary braking systems while operating apparatus on wet or potentially slippery roads; (2) require all drivers to become familiar with all of the different models of fire apparatus that they may be expected to operate; (3) enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the use of seat belts in all emergency vehicles, and (4) ensure that all drivers of fire department vehicles are responsible for the safe and prudent operation of the vehicle under all conditions.</li

><td><ul><li>On July 26, 2006, a 17-year-old female volunteer junior fire fighter (the victim) died after the tanker truck she was riding in went off a narrow one-lane bridge.  The tanker was enroute to a structure fire and failed to negotiate a sharp curve at the approach to the bridge.  The tanker crashed through the bridge's guardrail and landed upside down below the bridge.  The driver and two other fire fighters riding in the tanker were injured in the incident.  The victim was extricated by emergency personnel and pronounced dead at the scene.  NIOSH investigators concluded that, in order to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:  (1) ensure that fire fighters are always seated in an approved riding position any time the fire apparatus is in motion; (2) ensure that all fire apparatus are equipped with seat belts and that fire fighters always wear seatbelts; (3) ensure that tankers are operated at a safe and reasonable speed; (4) provide initial and refresher
 training (at least twice annually) to driver/operators as often as necessary for the safe operation of fire tankers; (5) develop and enforce written policies, procedures, and/or guidelines that identify the permissible and non-permissible tasks and activities of junior fire fighters; (6) establish an effective preventive maintenance program for all fire apparatus; (7) establish and develop written standard operating procedures for all fire fighting operations; (8) avoid using former fuel trucks as water tankers, if at all possible.  Additionally States should, (9) consider developing a State-endorsed junior fire fighter program that addresses the tasks that minors are permitted to perform in the fire service, and (10) consider requiring vehicle safety inspections for fire apparatus.</li

The Chief was driving a military surplus truck that had been converted into a tanker.  He was traveling to a nearby town to obtain a State inspection.  While driving on the gravel road at approximately 40 miles per hour, the left front tire ruptured causing him to lose control, leave the road, and roll over several times.  The Chief was ejected and died on the scene from his injuries. NIOSH investigators conclude that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:  (1) Develop and enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) for seat belt use.  (2) Determine a safe operating weight for water tankers based on vehicle characteristics and remove overweight vehicles from service.

><td><ul><li>On March 3, 2004, a 40-year-old male forest ranger (the victim) died after he lost control of the brush truck he was driving to a controlled burn.  The truck experienced a catastrophic blow-out of the right front tire, left the road, struck a culvert and overturned.  It came to rest on its roof in a ditch filled with approximately 2 feet of water.  The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.  NIOSH investigators concluded that to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire management agencies and fire departments should:  1) Provide driver training as often as necessary to meet the requirements of NFPA 1451.  Training should incorporate specifics on maintaining vehicle control when a rapid loss of tire pressure (blowout) occurs. 2) As part of the apparatus maintenance program, ascertain the age of tires and impose time restrictions for usage according to manufacturers' specifications and guidelines.  Although it is unclear if the following contributed to this incident, fire
 management agencies and fire departments should consider implementing the following recommendation based on prudent safety considerations.  3) Ensure that vehicles meet the requirements of NFPA 1901 and NFPA 1906 and do not exceed their load-carrying capacity.</li

><td><ul><li>On August 14, 2004, a 25-year-old female career fire fighter (the victim) died when she apparently fell from the tailboard and was backed over by an engine.  The victim and her crew had been released from the scene of a residential fire.  The road was blocked by other apparatus, so the victim's crew began backing to an intersection approximately 300 feet away in order to proceed forward.  The victim took her position on the tailboard as the "Tailboard Safety Member" and signaled the driver to begin backing.  A Captain acting as the "Traffic Control Officer" guided the backing operation from the road on the driver's side, behind the apparatus, by using hand signals.  When the Captain turned and walked into the intersection to stop cross-traffic,  the victim apparently fell from the tailboard and was run over by the engine.  Members on the scene provided advanced life support and the victim was transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead.  NIOSH investigators
 concluded that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:  (1) Modify existing policies to prohibit members from riding on the tailboard or any exposed position when the vehicle is in motion; (2) Develop, implement, and periodically review standard operating procedures for backing fire apparatus; and (3) Consider equipping apparatus with safety equipment such as mirrors, automatic sensing devices, and/or video cameras to assist with backing operations.</li

The tanker truck drifted off the roadway causing the driver to lose control of the truck and to overturn.  The driver crawled out a window.  The victim was ejected and trapped beneath the front passenger door.  She was extricated by emergency personnel and transported to a county hospital where she was pronounced dead upon arrival.  NIOSH investigators concluded that, in order to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:  -Adopt the International Association of Fire Chief's Zero-Tolerance Policy for Alcohol and Drinking to prohibit the use of alcohol by members of any fire or emergency services agency/organization at any time when they may be called upon to act or respond as a member of those departments.  Departments should develop written  policies and have procedures in place to enforce this policy.
 -Develop and enforce standard operating procedures (SOP's) that require mandatory use of seatbelts in all vehicles.  -Develop or revise existing SOP's to specify permissible and non-permissible tasks and activities for youth members participating in junior fire service programs.  -Provide training to driver/operators as often as necessary to meet the requirements of NFPA 1451, and incorporate specifics on rollover prevention in standard operating procedures (SOP's).  -Select and utilize only the safest drivers to operate emergency vehicles.  -Use caution when retrofitting non-fire service apparatus to serve as tankers, and when this is a necessity, ensure that the vehicle does not exceed its load-carrying capacity and meets the requirements of NFPA 1901 Standard for Automotive Fire Apparatus.</li

The victim was traveling to a wildland fire on an unpaved road within a National Forest.  The tanker failed as a result of a rollover crash.  The victim was traveling to a wildland fire on an unpaved road within a National Forest.  The tanker failed to negotiate a curve, rolled over, left the road, and rolled several more times down into a canyon.  The victim was ejected from the cab during the rollover and was found lying unresponsive on the ground.  He was pronounced dead at the scene.  NIOSH investigators concluded that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should - determine a safe operating weight for water tankers based on vehicle characteristics and remove overweight vehicles from service;  - develop comprehensive apparatus maintenance programs and guidelines that include
 regularly scheduled inspections, documentation, and procedures for removing apparatus from service until major defects are repaired;  -  ensure that all fire apparatus are equipped with seat belts.  Additionally, States should  - consider developing a vehicle inspection and maintenance program prior to distributing surplus military vehicles to the fire service.</li

><td><ul><li>On September 5, 2002, a 17-year old male volunteer fire fighter (the victim) was fatally injured after the tanker truck he was driving overturned while responding to a brush fire.  The tanker was traveling south on a two-lane county road when it drifted off the right side of the road, causing the driver to lose control.  The driver tried to correct the direction of travel of the tanker but was unable to recover.  The tanker went down a slight embankment and overturned, trapping the victim.  The victim was extricated and then transported to a local hospital by ambulance where he was pronounced dead.  NIOSH investigators concluded that, in order to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:  1) prohibit driving by firefighters less than 18 years of age and revise existing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for driving fire apparatus so that they reflect insurance guidelines;  2) ensure that the radio in the driving compartment is within convenient reach
 for the driver;  3) incorporate specifics on rollover prevention in SOPs and driver training.  Additionally, states should consider developing a junior fire fighter and emergency service program that addresses the tasks that minors are permitted to perform in the fire service.</li

The brush truck was making a U-turn on the roadway through heavy smoke when a vehicle skidded into it.  The victim was ejected from the left side of the work platform and run over by the brush truck.  The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.  NIOSH investgators concluded that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should - ensure that fire fighters attack a brush fire from a safe place on the apparatus or walk alongside the moving apparatus  - ensure that adequate traffic control is in place before turning attention to the emergency  - enforce Standard Operating Procedures that require operators of fire apparatus to wear seat belts (restraints) whenever operating the vehicle.</li

><td><ul><li>On April 11, 2002, a 61-year-old male career fire chief (the victim), providing mutual aid at a scene of a motor vehicle incident, died after being struck by a fire truck.  A 26-year-old male volunteer fire chief (the driver) from another department lost control of the fire truck after his brakes failed as he was arriving on the scene.  The driver received injuries and was transported by ambulance to a regional hospital where he was hospitalized and then discharged the following day.  The victim was transported by ambulance to a regional hospital where he was pronounced dead.  NIOSH investigators concluded that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should develop comprehensive apparatus maintenance programs in accordance with manufacturer's specifications and instructions that include regularly scheduled inspections, documentation, and procedures for removing apparatus from service until major defects are repaired; ensure all drivers of fire department
 vehicles receive driver training at least twice a year; develop, implement, and enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding emergency operations for highway incidents; ensure that while operating at an emergency scene, personnel wear personal protective clothing that is suitable to that incident, such as a highly visible reflectorized flagger vest (strong yellow-green or orange); develop, implement, and enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the safe operation of emergency vehicles which include the use of seat belts.  Additionally, municipalities should consider establishing and maintaining regional mutual-aid radio channels to coordinate and communicate activities involving units from multiple jurisdictions.</li

En route to the call the tanker was traveling eastbound on a two-lane state road, and after making a moderate curve the tanker drifted off the roadway on the right eastbound lane.  The victim lost control of the tanker after he overcorrected to bring the tanker back onto the roadway. The tanker continued to travel across the left westbound side of the roadway, entered a ditch, hit an embankment and struck a utility pole.  The tanker overturned completing one revolution then continued to slide on the left westbound side of the roadway, before coming to a rest on the passenger side with the victim entrapped under the tanker.

><td><ul><li>On December 14, 2001, a 68-year-old male volunteer fire fighter responded to a call of a chimney fire.  The victim responded from his home in his personal vehicle to the nearest fire station.  As one of the fire department's drivers, he began to drive the 2,200-gallon tanker to the fire scene.  At approximately 1457 hours, less than 1 mile from the fire station, the tanker left the roadway and slid down a 100-foot embankment, hitting several trees along the way.  Emergency medicl technicians and paramedics reached the victim several minutes later, finding the victim unresponsive.  Initial assessment found the victim in the driver's seat, lap belt buckled, with some head trauma (lacerations to his forehead and the bridge of his nose) but no chest trauma.  Some reports were conflicting as to whether the victim initially had a peripheral pulse, but this quickly degenerated into no pulse and no respirations.  Despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced life support
 (ALS) performed at the scene, in the flight-for-life helicopter, and at the hospital emergency department, the fire fighter died.  Based on the fire fighter's clinical history and the post-mortem examination, his death certificate, completed by the Chief Deputy County Coroner, listed hear failure as the immediate cause of death due to arteriosclerotic heart disease.  The following recommendations address some general health and safety issues identified during this investigation.  This list includes some preventive measures that have been recommended by other agencies to reduce the risk of on-the-job heart attacks, sudden cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death among fire fighters.  While some of these strategies could be used at this Fire Department, it is unlikely any of these measures could have prevented this victim's untimely death.  These selected recommendations have not been evaluated by NIOSH, but represent published research, consensus votes of technical committees of the
 National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), or fire service labor/management groups.  The medical decision regarding when, or if, to return to duty a member with medical conditions should be made by the physician providing occupational health services for the fire department.  Expand the annual medical evaluation program currently required for "Active Retired Members" to include all members of the fire department.  The frequency and content of this evaluation should be consistent with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1582, Standard on Medical Requirements for Fire Fighters and Information for Fire Department Physicians.  Members who perform active fire suppression should have medical clearance to wear a respirator.  This clearance procedure can be incorporated into the annual medical evaluation.  Phase in a mandatory wellness/fitness program for fire fighters to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease and improve cardiovascular capacity.</li

A stationary fill tank was being used as part of the fill operation.  The fill tank became over-pressurized by the engine's booster pump and suffered catastrophic failure.  The tank was catapulted approximately 100 feet vertically into the air, landing on top of the front left corner of the engine's cab.  The victim was standing immediately outside the cab while operating a switch inside the cab and was struck as the tank fell to the ground.  Fire fighters and paramedics on the scene provided immediate medical treatment.  The victim was transported to a nearby hospital where he died the next day.</li

At 1900 hours, the fire department began performing a water shuttle training exercise.  At approximately 2000 hours, the victim was driving Tanker 63 en route to the station with the junior fire fighter as a passenger.  Tanker 63 was traveling eastbound on a two-lane state road when it drifted off the east edge of the roadway.  The victim steered it back onto the roadway. The tanker traveled a short distance on the center line before the victim lost control after he overcorrected in an attempt to steer the tanker back into the right eastbound lane.  The tanker left the right (east) roadway and traveled down an embankment and through a ditch line.  The tank separated from the chassis, became airborne and rotated approximately 180 degrees before landing on the ground, while the
 truck overturned and rolled upside down before coming to rest on its top.  The junior firefighter was ejected from the tanker and sustained serious injuries. The victim was trapped inside the cab of the truck.  He was removed and taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.</li

The career department was battling fires in approximately 200 hay bales and requested an additional supply of water.  Upon receiving the call for assistance, the victim responded in the department's tanker truck.  The tanker truck rounded a curve near the center line and drove off the right shoulder of the northbound lane.  In an attempt to steer the top-heavy truck back onto the road surface, the victim oversteered and lost control of the vehicle.  He locked up the truck's air brakes but could not bring the truck under control.  The truck crossed the center line and reached the shoulder of the southbound lane.  The truck tires dug into the shoulder, causing the truck to flip and roll.  The victim was partially ejected through the rear window of the cab.  The truck came to rest upside down with the victim partially
 trapped within the truck between the top of the cab and the ground.  The victim was extricated from the truck and transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.</li

><td><ul><li>On December 18, 1999, a 22-year-old male volunteer fire fighter (the victim) died and a 30-year-old volunteer district chief was injured after the rescue truck he was driving veered off the road, struck an oncoming car and then a tree.  The incident occurred while they were responding to a reported gas leak at a private residence.  The volunteer district chief (driver) and a fire fighter (the victim) responded in Rescue 49.  While en route, the driver looked down at the dashboard to lower his response priority by shutting off his lights and siren.  While doing so, the truck's right side tires dropped off the road surface into a ditch.  During the driver's efforts to bring the truck back onto the roadway, he overcompensated, causing the truck to cross the oncoming lane of traffic and strike an oncoming car.  Just prior to striking the car, the driver started steering the truck back to the right to avoid a second collision.  Due to the momentum of the truck, it struck a tree and
 flipped onto the driver's side.  Seconds after the wreck, the driver crawled out of his loose seat belt and out of the truck.  Several residents called Central Dispatch to report the incident.  The driver was taken by ambulance to a local hospital where he was treated and released.  The victim, who was trapped inside the vehicle, was removed and taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.</li

The incident occurred while they were responding in Tanker 3 to a mutual aid call which had been dispatched as a grass fire and which threatened nearby structures.  The tanker was traveling west on a two-lane state road (photo #1).  As it approached the curve,  the driver (victim #2) lost control of the tanker.  It drifted towards the shoulder of the road as the driver tried to correct the direction of travel.  Just past the curve it veered off the road and into a corn field.  The tanker rolled on the passenger side (victim #1's side), and continued to roll several times (photo #2).  Victim #2 was ejected out the driver's side window.  Victim #1 was entrapped in the crushed upside-down cab and had to be extricated.
 He was transported to a local hospital and remained conscious and able to communicate, but died 7 days after the incident.  Victim #2 was transported by ambulance to a local hospital then flown by life flight helicopter to a trauma center.  He remained hospitalized and was conscious, by was unable to communicate and died 86 days after the incident.</li

The victim lost control of the truck as he approached a slight curve in the roadway.  The truck began to skid, and the right tires traveled onto the shoulder.  Continuing on the shoulder, the truck entered a ditch, became airborne, crossed a lane on a side street, and struck a center median.  The truck crossed a second lane on a side street, struck a guardrail, and flipped end over end until it landed in a concrete culvert.  The victim was killed instantly.</li

><td><ul><li>On March 17, 2000, a 31-year-old male career fire fighter/engineer (the victim) died after the apparatus (Truck 1) that he was driving collided with an Amtrak train at a railroad crossing.  The victim was returning to the station after his apparatus, along with others, was cancelled when the alarm was determined to be false.  Responding in addition to Truck 1 were Squad 1, Engine 2, Engine 11, Engine 1, Squad 3, and Battalion Commander (BC-1).  Engine 2, the first unit on the scene at a commercial structure, determined the alarm was false and cancelled all responding units.  Engine 1 was returning to the station with Truck 1 and Squad 1 following when  Truck 1 and Squad 1 turned onto another road.  Truck 1, followed by Squad 1, stopped behind a civilian vehicle on the west side of a railroad crossing consisting of three sets of tracks.  The safety gates at the crossing were down, the warning lights were activated, and a freight train was moving slowly on the tracks.  Squad 1
 decided to take an alternative route back to the fire station.  The freight train stopped after it cleared the crossing to wait for the signal ahead.  Truck 1 started to go around the first safety gate and over the track (see Diagram).  Witness #1, in a vehicle behind Truck 1, saw a tanker car at the end of the freight train that obstructed the northbound view of the tracks, and he heard a train whistle.  Witness #2, waiting in a vehicle on the east side of the crossing, saw a southbound Amtrak train approaching.  He also saw Truck 1 driving around the first safety gate, so he honked his horn and flashed his headlights to warn the driver of the Amtrak train.  Truck 1 continued around the safety gate and traveled into the path of the train, which struck the truck's left front corner and the bucket of the aerial ladder.  The victim was ejected, landing behind the truck's left rear dual wheel.  He was killed instantly.</li

At 1522 hours, the fire department was dispatched to a motor-vehicle incident, with unknown injuries.  At 1523 hours, the victim responded in Engine 40.  At 1539 hours, the victim radioed to Central Dispatch that the call was unfounded and he was returning to the station.  En route to the station, the engine was traveling northbound on a two-lane state road.  The engine drifted off the roadway on the right (east) side and passed over a large hole created by erosion at the end of a drainage culvert.  The victim lost control of the engine after he overcorrected and applied his brakes in an attempt to steer the engine back onto the road.  The engine rotated counterclockwise, came back onto the roadway and overturned.  The engine rolled
 approximately one and three-quarter revolutions as it continued to skid, traveling northbound.  The victim was ejected from the engine and sustained fatal injuries as a result of the collision.  The engine came to rest on its left side, facing west and blocking the southbound lane of the roadway.  The cab area of the engine burst into flames as it sat at rest.</li

At approximately 1150 hours, Central Dispatch notified a career fire department of an automatic alarm at a residential structure.  Truck 24 (Hook and Ladder) and Engine 121 immediately responded.  Truck 24 traveled approximately 7 blocks and approached a four-way-stop intersection.  The driver of Truck 24 approached the intersection and made a rolling stop.  As the driver proceeded through the intersection, a civilian pickup truck (a Ford F-150) ran the stop sign and collided with the apparatus.  The victim was ejected from the passenger-side door of the truck and received massive head injuries.  He was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  The other three fire fighters and the driver of the truck received medical attention for their injuries and were released.</li

A 35-year-old female volunteer fire fighter who was a passenger in the engine was also injured.  At 1530 hours, the volunteer component of this combination fire department was notified by Central Dispatch of a motor-vehicle incident involving injuries.  Rescue 2 (two fire fighters/paramedics) and Engine 1 (a driver/operator [the victim] and a fire fighter [the injured]) responded to the scene.  The Assistant Chief responded in his privately owned vehicle (POV). En route to the scene of the motor-vehicle incident, the driver of the engine pulled/swerved to the right side of the road to avoid colliding with an oncoming vehicle.  The engine traveled onto the soft shoulder and continued for approximately 230 feet.  To avoid striking a utility pole, the driver steered the engine sharply back
 onto the road.  He overcompensated, and the engine traveled across both lanes, left the road, and struck a large tree.  The passenger was ejected from the cab of the engine and landed approximately 30 feet away.  At 1537 hours, Central Dispatch requested all volunteers to respond to the scene to assist in the extrication of the victim.  The victim was trapped in the engine and was removed approximately 1½ hours later.  The victim and the passenger were taken by ambulance to an area hospital. The passenger was hospitalized for 5 days, and the victim died 3 days after the incident.</li

><td><ul><li>A 28-year-old male volunteer fire fighter died after the engine he was driving veered off the road, overturned onto the passenger side and struck a tree.  The incident occurred while returning to the station.  A volunteer fire department was dispatched to a motor-vehicle incident involving injuries.  The Assistant Chief, who was first to arrive via his privately owned vehicle, assessed the scene and determined that no one was injured.  He canceled Engine 252 and the rescue truck, which were en route to the scene. While driving to the station, the victim apparently steered the Engine toward the shoulder of the road to provide more room for oncoming traffic.  As he approached the shoulder, the right rear dual tires went off the road.  Due to the insufficient hard shoulder and the steep incline of the ditch beside the road, the victim was unable to get the Engine back onto the road.  Continuing off the road and into the ditch for approximately 280 feet, the Engine overturned onto
 the passenger side, striking a large tree.  The victim was killed instantly.  NIOSH investigators conclude that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:  1. Ensure all drivers of large apparatus complete state certified driver/operator classes;  2. Ensure all drivers of fire department vehicles are responsible for the safe and prudent operation of the vehicle under all conditions.</li
