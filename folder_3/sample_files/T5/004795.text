Meeting Summary

        Today at 3pm, W. Prado, C. Martins, V. Bodyagin, C. Avila,
M. Strang, S. Novaes and J. Barreto met at Salle des Heros to discuss
the dipole elastic data sample and its tracking, for Runs 342-347.

        The Data sample contains 760 evts (out of ~140K raw events), and
pots locations are estimated to be at D1=11.89mm (~15Sig) and D2=11.57mm
(~16Sig), respectively. All plots presented during the meeting can be
found (set0302.tar.gz file) at

                www-clued0.fnal.gov/~barreto/fpd/data_analysis/

        Data have been reconstructed using the standard procedure in the
tracking code and results can be found in the plots:

1) D1_hits.ps ---> Hit distributions at D1 location;
2) D2_hits.ps ---> Hit distributions at D2 location;
3) dip_x_cor.ps --> X correlations
4) dip_y_cor.ps --> Y correlations
5) xi_dip_reco.ps --> reconstructed xi_distribution;
6) t_dip_reco.ps  --> reconstructed t_distribution;
7) xi_dip_halo_reco.ps --> ibid, for the halo sample;
8) t_dip_halo_reco.ps ---> ibid.

        From these plots, it seems there is real good correlations at
both dipoles pots, and hit distributions seem quite right, containing
high reconstructed x_values, which could be associate with high t events,
since trigger was D1.D2.P1O. However, MC results shows that for elastic
and at these pot locations, shouldn't exist any elastic events, since
high_t elastic trajectories hit the beam pipe somewhere inside quadrupoles
and separators (see dip_xy.ps file), without reaching the dipole
locations. Although MC was done with no smearing in the Z-vertex, its
results is not expected to change by a large x amount when including the
smearing on it.

        After some discussion, we came up with two different conclusions
about these results:

1) Pots are much closer to the beam than we think it is;

2) Data contain basically halo hits and the trigger veto is not doing
its job correctly. One possibility to consider, in this case, is the fact
that the beam profile is vertical at the P_side and horizontal at
Pbar_side. For the p_side, halo particle should be much more extended in
the vertical plane than in the horizontal one. The opposite happens in the
pbar side. Since we are vetoing early hits with P1O (horizontal side),
much of the vertical halo particles are not vetoed in the
(horizontal) pbar side. However, such explanation only holds if the beam
indeed rotates physically of 90 degrees by going from the p_side to the
pbar_side. If it only gets squeezed, not rotated, then the actual trigger
set should work. Maybe Mike Martens can clarify this point further.

        Any other idea in this issue will be welcome.

helium in tunnel

I have gotten more information on the He in the Tev tunnel. There are
known leaks in the Tevatron cryo system. Mostly this is due to leaks in
the ceramic feedthroughs in the corrector spool pieces of which there
are hundreds. The spool pieces are being retrofitted to eliminate/reduce
the leaks, but this is a long term project that won't be finished for
years.

There are fans to circulate the air in the Tevatron tunnel at about 3 to
4 mph. Of course, this doesn't help the He situation since air is only
pushed around. There is no system to exchange tunnel air with the
outside air so it is not likely that we can reduce the He levels in the
tunnel in any convenient manner in the short term.

I am not sure what options we have. If it is really a problem we would
have to figure out a way to isolate the area around our detectors and
circulate fresh air into that volume. I don't know how difficult this
would be, but my guess is that it would have to happen during a
significantly long
shutdown.___________________________________________________________________

Pot Position webpage

I've created a new interactive webpage that calculates sigma's from beam
for pot positions as well as using the most restrictive sigma from groups
of pots moved in to calculate which positions all pots in the group should
be
moved to in order for them to all be at the same sigma.

The page can be found at:

http://d0server1.fnal.gov/users/strang/web/fpd/documents/potpos.html

The first section is for input:

I've defaulted the emittances to 20 and used the latest values I have
for beam displacement. These values can be changed if needed to reflect
actual beam conditions. I've hardcoded the beta values, beam energy and home
to
beam pipe center values from the latest information I have.

The important part to update is the pot positions in mm from home. Type
in the values for all pots that have been moved in their final positions.
Then click
on the Calculate button.

The bottom of the page will now show the following:

Sigma from beam for all pots that have been moved. A 0 means the pot
wasn't moved.

Distance of pot from the beam in mm.

Finally, separately for dipoles, horizontal pots and vertical pots, it
will scan the moved pots and find the largest sigma value then calculate
where all
other pots in the group should be moved so that they are at this same sigma.

Please look at the page and send me any comments.

FPD channels: VRB location

The web location of the current VRB channel spreadsheet is

http://d0server1.fnal.gov/projects/triggerelectronics/locations%26cables/cab
le_spreadseets/vrb_channels_afe8_20020823.xls

The SVX (Sequencer) data are in VRB crate x52, slot x13;
SVX info: sheet '52 M213-1'
The trigger data are in VRB crate x13, slot C, 'channel' (fiber, really) 2
and 3 , i.e. the last two fibers.
Trigger info: sheet' Trig Optical Cable Source'.

The date in the file name might change, in which case the web browser access
doesn't really help
