<P><FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is enhancing its
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Teams with local
fire department decontamination capabilities, fire district
decontamination companies, and hospital decontamination
companies to provide the entire State (rural and urban areas)
with access to fully equipped HazMat teams and mass
decontamination capabilities.  In the event of a chemical,
biological, or radiological attack, a phased response system
will be activated to provide for the decontamination of large
numbers of people in a manner that maintains control of the
incident, reduces harm to exposed persons, and prevents the
spread of the agent by contaminated persons.  </FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Rapid Response System (RRS) relies on the immediate
initiation of decontamination by local first responders, who
are supported by a phased decontamination response that
provides the local jurisdiction with the ability to access,
decontaminate, and treat exposed persons, including those
who cannot extricate themselves or be safely extricated. 
The RRS also provides for a decontamination capability at
hospital facilities that may receive patients from the local
emergency medical service or by self-transportation.  </FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The concept introduced by Massachusetts is one  approach
that is being implemented at the State and local levels to
prepare emergency responders to safely and effectively
respond to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) terrorism
incidents.  As the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP)
learns of new or innovative approaches, it will publish a
<EM>State and Local Approaches</EM> bulletin to share that
information with other jurisdictions that might be looking
for solutions to similar problems.  ODP has not evaluated
these approaches, and the sharing of the information should
not be interpreted as an endorsement.  Those interested in
the specific details of this approach should contact the
project  director identified at the end of the bulletin. </FONT>




<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#ff8000"></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#ff8000"><STRONG>Hazardous Materials Response Teams</STRONG></FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Six regional teams currently provide the entire State with
access to fully equipped hazardous materials teams that can
assist a local jurisdiction in responding to a WMD terrorism
incident.  The teams, established by the Massachusetts
Department of Fire Services, Hazardous Materials Response
Division, are available within one hour to all communities,
not just the major urban areas.</FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Each HazMat team consists of 40 to 70 firefighter/HazMat
technicians and support personnel drawn from participating
local fire departments.  Each district has one or two
Operational Response Units and one Technical Operations
Module.  An Operational Response Unit is a HazMat
equipment vehicle that carries all personal protective
equipment and control equipment which allows the teams to
enter an "immediately dangerous to life and health"
environment and/or less severe environment.  These units
also carry the mass casualty decontamination system,
consisting  of tents, decontamination pools, heaters, lights,
water manifolds, hoses and wands, and a locally developed
rail system that allows for the free movement of stretcher-borne casualties.  The system can be readily configured to
decontaminate ambulatory patients, non-ambulatory
patients, and emergency response personnel simultaneously.</FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Technical Operations Modules are science and control
units for each HazMat team and contain the chemical
detection monitors and communications equipment for the
teams.  Technical Operations Modules carry the following
detection and monitoring equipment (<EM>the listing of specific
equipment is not inclusive and does not imply an ODP
endorsement of this equipment)</EM>:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Department of Fire Services has proposed the establishment of "decon
companies" within fire departments in each of the 15 fire districts in the State
that are equipped to conduct mass decontamination of victims of a chemical or
biological weapons attack.  These units would significantly enhance a local
jurisdiction's ability to decontaminate and treat victims of such an attack by:</FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Decreasing the time to decontaminate self-extricated victims</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Reducing HazMat personnel's involvement in decon</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Focusing HazMat resources on victims remaining in the contaminated
area</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Focusing HazMat resources on mitigation to reduce the risk of additional
people being contaminated</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Reducing the risk of secondary contamination from people leaving the
scene</FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Each decon company would be provided with equipment that is stored on trailers
and maintained in a ready state by the local department.  Each participating fire
department would also enter into an agreement with the State to maintain the
equipment, make it immediately available upon request, and to have its personnel
trained in decon procedures.  The Department of Fire Services estimates that,
including the trailers and the equipment specified below, each decon company
will cost approximately $20,000. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#ff8000"><STRONG>Hospital Decontamination Companies</STRONG></FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While some hospitals in the State have developed a decontamination
capability for single patients, few,  if any, have the ability to decontaminate
multiple patients arriving at the same time.  In order to provide the capacity to
decontaminate victims at the hospitals without further taxing hospital
personnel engaged in treating the victims, the Department of Fire Services has
proposed the establishment of additional fire department decon companies. 
The decon companies would be based in communities with hospital
emergency departments and would respond directly to a predetermined
hospital during a terrorism incident.</FONT>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Implementation of this component of the RRS will require joint planning
between the fire departments and  hospitals to determine where the decon area
would be located, if power and water are available at the site or if they must
be supplied by the decon unit, and procedures to ensure that all contaminated
patients are directed to the decon area prior to entering the hospital.</FONT>
