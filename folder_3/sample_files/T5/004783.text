Subject: NuMI Review Final Report


Fermilab Review of NuMI Beam Extraction and Beam Transport Systems
Final Report
February 17, 2000


      The Fermilab Beams Division held an internal review of the NuMI 
Beam Extraction and Beam Transport systems at Fermilab on January 
25-26, 2000.  A list of the committee members can be found in 
Appendix I, and the schedule of presentations in Appendix II.  What 
follows is a report from the Committee on this meeting.

     First of all, the Committee would like to commend the members of 
the NuMI Project for their efforts to present the design and relevant 
project issues.  The presentations were well organized and thorough 
given the one-day format of the review.  NuMI constitutes a major 
physics and construction program at Fermilab, and a large amount of 
effort was evident.

      NuMI is expected to deliver in one year an equivalent number of 
protons on target as has been delivered by the entire Fermilab Fixed 
Target Program to date.  The need to accomplish this with a loss rate 
of about 0.01% shows that a high-level of support is required by the 
Beams Division and Laboratory management.  The level of rigor 
required to maintain NuMI in its operational state is very high.  The 
Committee cannot emphasize enough the need to provide NuMI with 
enough support from the Beams Division to realize its very stringent 
goals.  This would imply not just more people on the job, but the 
"right" people to ensure success.

      The findings of the Committee will be discussed now in 
approximately the order of presentation.


BEAM EXTRACTION MODE

      The Committee concurs with the choice of single-turn extraction 
over resonant extraction.  The latter would introduce losses on the 
electrostatic septa which are inherently a few percent and would be 
unacceptably high.

      It was noted that Lambertson magnets are often loss points in 
accelerators, but that much of the time this is at injection when the 
beam size is larger.  The aperture at the Q608 quadrupole magnet is 
tight.  However, the extraction system to be used for NuMI is similar 
to the systems used at other Main Injector locations for extraction 
(Tevatron transfers and abort system).  The Committee recommends that 
beam loss at Tevatron beam transfers and/or during antiproton 
production be examined in detail.  The latter should be indicative of 
the NuMI extraction process.


BEAM EXTRACTION KICKER

      The beam extraction process to NuMI is operationally tied to 
beam extraction for antiproton production. The operating scenario 
proposed is to have 6 batches of beam from the Booster injected and 
accelerated to 120 GeV in the Main Injector. The bunches are then put 
through a process in the Main Injector known as bunch rotation, in 
which the bunch length is minimized and momentum spread increased. 
One of the six batches is extracted to the Pbar Source.  The NuMI 
beam is saved for last so that the NuMI kicker fall time can be 
relaxed.  A system to bring the kicker magnet's field down in the 
short gap between batches would be much more expensive than that 
designed.  However bunch rotation maximizes the momentum spread of 
the entire beam and thus could lead to losses in the NUMI transfer 
line unless precautions are taken to either extract the NUMI beam 
after another 90 degrees rotation (or odd multiple thereof), or to 
recapture the beam in a low voltage bucket.  Either method would 
minimize the momentum spread.

      Members of the Committee noted that the bunch rotation process 
can generate small longitudinal emittance growth which can be 
non-reproducible from cycle to cycle.  With an eye to controlling 
losses at the 0.01% level, it may be better for the NuMI beam to be 
extracted prior to doing bunch rotation.  This would require kicker 
system improvements.  Again, beam studies are recommended to study 
the beam loss expected during bunch rotation at very high intensities.

      The extraction process introduces a large horizontal orbit 
excursion in the extraction region.  This practice is used in the 
other extraction regions, and the orbit excursion is generated by 
moving MI quadrupole magnets.  For NuMI, MI corrector magnets are to 
be used, the required strength of which is roughly 50% of the maximum 
strength available.  The Committee recommends looking at moving 
quadrupole magnets to achieve the required extraction trajectory of 
the circulating beam at flattop, reserving the corrector magnets for 
their intended use.


PRIMARY BEAM TRANSPORT

      The primary beam transport system is made up of two major 
vertical bends near the beginning and end of the line and a major 
horizontal bend at the beginning of the line.   The horizontal bend 
establishes the horizontal direction toward Sudan, MN.  The first 
vertical bend gets the Target Hall into the bedrock.  The second 
vertical bend sets the final grade toward the Sudan detector.

      One aspect of the design that may need more attention is the 
momentum dispersion generated by the vertical bends.  The vertical 
drop of approximately 60 feet (20 m) generates approximately 20 m of 
vertical dispersion.  Thus, a particle whose momentum is off by 0.1% 
will arrive at the Target Hall with a trajectory displaced from the 
ideal trajectory by 20 mm.  The momentum spread of the beam coming 
from the MI was projected to be on the order of 0.02%.  Using this 
number, the spot size due to momentum spread is comparable to the 
spot size due to betatron emittance, making the spot size 40% larger. 
Recent measurements of the momentum spread in the MI appear to be 2-5 
times larger than this number during antiproton stacking studies. 
Additionally, variations of the average extracted momentum from the 
MI have been recorded recently as +/- 0.1%.

      Efforts have begun to redesign the optics to reduce the momentum 
dispersion, though its slope is still quite large at the target 
making it sensitive to quadrupole mistuning.  Further tweaking of the 
optical design to reduce its sensitivity to momentum spread and 
tuning errors is strongly encouraged.  The range of momentum spread 
expected to be extracted from the Main Injector should also be 
verified.  Additionally, the initial conditions for the optical 
design have been the design lattice function values of the Main 
Injector; these assumptions should also be verified now that the Main 
Injector is operational.

      A sensitivity analysis of the beam transport system design was 
not presented.  Studies were not presented of the effects of magnet 
mispowering (of both bending and focusing magnets) and misalignments 
to see if the correction systems and power supply arrangements can 
correct errors to the required tolerances.  Specifications and 
tolerances on power supplies -- regulation, granularity of control, 
etc. -- need to be developed and checked against foreseen beam based 
correction algorithms.

      While beam instrumentation is included in the design, it was not 
clear that instruments -- loss monitors, beam position monitors and, 
in particular, profile monitors -- had been placed in optimal 
locations for useful and meaningful measurements during operation. 
An additional beam toroid in the middle of the beamline may also 
prove useful.  It will become important to make measurements such as
   *  correlation of beam loss to energy spread
   *  beam emittance arriving from the Main Injector
   *  amplitude function measurements and beam matching
   *  targeting angle and positions with desired accuracy
during routine operation and the number and layout of devices should 
be determined in conjunction with the optical design of the line.


RADIATION SAFETY

      One of the most challenging -- if not the most challenging -- 
issues for the NuMI project is the monitoring of beam loss. 
Groundwater protection is one of the primary drivers of the beam 
transport design.  Many calculations have been carried out to study 
the effects of beam loss in the various geological regions of the 
project.  The following issues were brought up by the Committee:

    *  Mitigation of Carrier Pipe Loss Control

      The Carrier Pipe region of the beamline passes through the 
glacial till/bedrock interface.  It was pointed out that the loss of 
only a few beam pulses per year (at full intensity) can be tolerated 
in this region.  It is difficult to see how to tune up and maintain 
an operational system with this restriction.  If 10 seconds elapse 
before full intensity beam losses are detected to be in this region, 
then the experiment is shut off for a year.  While beam intensities 
will be computer monitored very closely, it is still an uncomfortable 
margin for the Committee.  If a method for increasing the tolerated 
losses by, say, a factor of at least 10 in this region could be 
developed, the Committee believes it would be well worth the money 
and effort.  Examples would be extra shielding in this region, or a 
better drainage system for moving activated water to the bedrock 
region.

      The loss tolerance in this area could cause significant 
operational problems.  A passive method, such as shielding or better 
drainage, for increasing the tolerated losses by a factor of at least 
10 (preferably 100) should be investigated and implemented.  The 
time, effort, and expenditures up front to eliminate this tight 
tolerance on losses will prove worthwhile in the long run.  Accidents 
and potential ground water contamination in this area could prove to 
be a major problem for not only the experiment but for the lab as 
well.

    *  Loss Monitor Calibration

      Calibration of loss monitors was seen to be an issue, in 
particular the use of heliax monitors which require periodic 
maintenance (changing of gas bottles, for instance).  There are only 
three such monitors -- is this enough spatial resolution?  While much 
of the beam loss monitoring will depend upon the use of sealed units 
(BLM's), their calibration needs to be addressed for use in 
monitoring total beam losses at the 0.01% level.

    *  Fault Analysis

      A detailed Fault Analysis and Radiation Source Analysis should 
be conducted.  These analyses should investigate the various failure 
modes which could be hypothesized during operation of the beamline, 
including power supply failures, magnet failures, kicker magnet 
misfires, orbit motion in the Main Injector, energy errors from the 
Main Injector, and so forth.  This could influence the optical design 
and/or placement of instrumentation, correction magnets, shielding, 
etc.

    *  Testing of Measurement Procedures

      The Committee recommends that NuMI beam loss instrumentation and 
procedures (such as AutoTune, loss monitoring and integration, etc.) 
be testing using existing accelerator beamlines.  For example, NuMI 
style beam loss monitors could be placed in the Main Injector at the 
Tevatron/Pbar extraction point and carefully monitored and studied 
during antiproton stacking cycles.  A measurement of the performance 
criteria needs to be made.  (Can 0.01% beam loss be detected and 
measured accurately?)


POWER SUPPLIES AND CONTROLS

      The Power Supply system and the Controls system both appear to 
be in good shape.  The power supply requirements have been defined 
and many supplies from earlier Fermilab operations are being reused 
for this project.  A thorough spreadsheet of has been compiled which 
contains magnet requirements and corresponding power supplies which 
have been identified.  In several cases, Transrex power supplies are 
being reused for this project -- a Committee member noted that the 
internal insulation of these supplies is a problem when they are used 
in modes other than 100 V operation.  This should be reviewed.

      The power supply interface to operations is straightforward and 
should be easy to use.  This is strongly endorsed by the Committee. 
It was questioned whether operating NuMI simultaneously with 
mini-BooNE will be an issue for power and cooling considerations. 
This needs to be looked at closely over the upcoming months.

      It was felt that the Controls System is using well understood, 
standard Fermilab equipment and procedures and is not seen to have 
any outstanding issues.


INSTRUMENTATION, ALIGNMENT, WATER, ETC.

      The following list of issues for instrumentation, alignment, and 
water systems was generated as a result of the Review:

    *  Temperature and humidity control in the tunnel, especially in 
the pre-target area, is seen to be a difficult problem and needs 
careful consideration.

    * The plan to put small orifice devices in the LCW system to 
regulate flow could eventually lead to problems with plugging from 
copper oxide.  Similar problems have occurred in the Antiproton 
Source and elsewhere, and people familiar with these problems should 
be consulted.

    *  Long-term maintenance and redundancy of components needs more 
attention.  For instance, access to water pumps located in the 
tunnel-level enclosure, which could require heavy radiation 
shielding, needs to be carefully planned.

    *  More details (cranes, etc.) concerning the installation of the 
B2 magnets are required.

    *  As mentioned earlier in the report, the beam instrumentation 
requirements need to be consistent with the optical properties of the 
beam line.  Are 1 mm and 0.5 mm wire spacing enough for the multiwire 
profile monitors?  Are there enough Beam Position Monitors in the 
line?


      As is common in a review of this nature, it is easy to point out 
deficiencies and forget to comment on the work that was well done. 
The above comments are to be regarded as constructive criticism.  The 
amount of hard work and dedicated time put into the NuMI Project thus 
far is very evident.  The NuMI Project is seeking to deliver beam at 
an unprecedented rate and with extremely high efficiency.
As stated earlier, the Beams Division and Laboratory management must 
provide the necessary resources and motivational backing to continue 
the project along its path to success.
