</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times Roman">Approximately 50 percent of
all motor vehicle collisions in Kings County, California have
historically occurred in the City of Hanford, for which the Hanford
Fire Department (HFD) provides emergency medical and rescue services.
Although the HFD provided good quality emergency medical care
for persons injured in highway crashes, the Department was concerned
about obstacles to timely response, such as adverse weather, distance
of equipment from the crash, frequent railroad crossings, and
&quot;mutual aid&quot; requests from outside the city.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman"><BR>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Univers">GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</FONT></B><FONT
 FACE="Univers"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman"><BR>
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals use a term, <B><I>Golden
Hour,</I></B> to refer to the most opportune period of time following
a crash during which a victim can be extricated and delivered
to a trauma center, while dramatically increasing the victim's
chances of surviving. The goal of the Vehicle Collision Rescue
Delivery project was improvement of the Hanford Fire Department's
EMS and response time, thereby improving the likelihood of emergency
care for crash victims during the <B><I>Golden Hour.</I></B> Objectives
of the project included:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times Roman">Assessing the adequacy of existing
  EMS equipment</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times Roman">Evaluating the location of EMS equipment
  relative to response time</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times Roman">Developing new dispatch and operating
  policies</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times Roman">Providing education and training

In September 1996, the Hanford Fire Department obtained endorsement
from the Hanford City Council to use Section 402 funds, provided
through the California Office of Traffic Safety, to develop the
Vehicle Collision Rescue Delivery Project, which would help give
new direction to the city's existing safety program. Some of the
strategies and activities used by the HFD included:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times Roman">The purchase and installation of
  new hydraulic rescue equipment and air bag lifting systems. This
  new extrication equipment was housed at Hanford Fire Station
  #2, and the existing equipment moved to the rescue unit at Hanford
  Fire Station #1, at the opposite side of the city. These strategic
  placements were designed to improve response time to a crash</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times Roman">The training of all career and volunteer
  personnel in use of the new equipment. One hundred twenty-five
  hours of training were provided to 30 department personnel</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times Roman">The education of the Hanford community
  in use of the new extrication equipment and on traffic safety,
  in general. The HFD conducted five public education events for
  more than 1,200 students, teachers, and Hanford residents</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Times Roman">The expansion of the HFD's knowledge
  of traffic safety concepts. Two members of the Department attended
  California's annual Traffic Safety Summit<BR>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">RESULTS<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times Roman">The Hanford Fire Department
    maintains response data on the Vehicle Collision Rescue Delivery
    Project, reporting quarterly to the State of California, Office
    of Traffic Safety. Although EMS responses for the HFD have increased
    by 67 percent from the base year through the first quarter of
    the second grant year, the average response time from arrival
    at the crash site to definitive care decreased during that same
    time by nearly 10 percent. Data collected prior to the base year
    revealed response times that frequently exceeded 200 percent
    above the average maintained since project implementation.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Times Roman">In addition, five public education
    events have been conducted for approximately 1,200 residents
    of Hanford, during which exhibitions on the use of <B><I>Jaws
    of Life</I></B> equipment were featured.</FONT></TD>
