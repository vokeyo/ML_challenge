	  <h2>Components:</h2>
	  <p>The  major new components of the TEAM instrument are the aberration corrector for  the probe, the sample stage, and the post-specimen corrector. These components  will be mounted on a new electron column specifically designed to be compatible  with aberration-corrected optics. </p>
	  <p>The  probe corrector, the stage and the post-specimen corrector will all be  designed, tested and optimized in different locations and on separate dedicated  microscope columns before implementing the results of these tests on the TEAM  instrument. </p>
	  <p>The  probe corrector builds on a hexapole design, further developed to meet the  increased demands for electronic stability and improved correction of higher  order aberrations.</p>
	  <p>The  stage provides five-axis (&alpha;, &beta;,  x, y, z) sample control, using a concept that is substantially different from  the side entry model employed in almost all existing electron microscopes. It  consists of two piezo-controlled modules without mechanical links to the  atmosphere. The design uses proven scanning tunneling microscope technology to  achieve high-precision positioning, effective control of vibration and drift,  and accurate position sensing. </p>
	  <p>The  post-specimen corrector is designed to correct both spherical and chromatic  aberrations. The device includes two Wien filters made of crossed electric and  magnetic quadrupoles and will use symmetry planes for self-cancellation of  undesirable aberrations. </p>
	  <p>Making  all the elements work together to provide the required performance has emerged  as a key issue in the development of most advanced electron scattering  instruments. TEAM will focus closely on column integration and optimization.  Integration of all components into a fully functional assembly will be the  final step of the TEAM construction project.</p>
	  <h3>Aberration Correction </h3>
	  <p>Electron  optical lenses suffer from aberrations similar to those in magnifying glasses  or telescopes. Spherical aberration causes an image to be blurred because  points are imaged as discs. Chromatic aberration leads to rainbow distortions at  the edge of an image because light of different color is refracted at different  angles. These two aberrations are illustrated schematically in ray diagrams.</p>

      Left: spherical aberration. Right: chromatic aberration. </p>
	  <br clear="both" />
	  <p>The same aberrations afflict optical microscopes and even  the Hubble space telescope. The difference in an image of outer space taken  with the Hubble space telescope before and after correction of spherical  aberration shows the increase in resolution and sharpness of the image.</p>

	  <p>Electromagnetic  lenses in an electron microscope are subject to chromatic, spherical and  higher-order aberrations. The resolution limit of electron microscopes is  described by the <em>Scherzer theorem</em>,  which states that chromatic aberration (Cc) and spherical aberration (Cs) are  unavoidable for static, rotationally-symmetric electron lenses. As a result,  the resolution of conventional electron microscopes is limited to about 100  times the wavelength of the electron. </p>
	  <p>To  surpass this limit is possible only by lifting one of the constraints of the  Scherzer theorem, for example by deviating from rotational symmetry. This can  be done with multipole elements (quadrupoles, hexapoles, octopoles etc.) used  as correctors, much like eye glasses are used as correctors for astigmatism or  short-sightedness in the human eye.</p>
	  <p>Two  types of correctors, the hexapole corrector and the quadrupole-octopole  corrector, have been proven successful in compensating for spherical  aberration. A  quadrupole-octopole corrector can also be the basis for a chromatic aberration  corrector.</p>
	  <p>The  information limit of a microscope results from mechanical and electromagnetic instabilities.  Recent technological advances make it possible to improve mechanical stability  by increasing the column&rsquo;s mechanical stiffness, and to reduce electromagnetic  instabilities by stabilizing the fields to an accuracy of about 100 parts per  billion. These measures will extend the information limit beyond  0.05&nbsp;nanometer. To reach the goal of raising the resolution limit to the  information limit requires mechanical alignment of the numerous multipole  elements via a computer-assisted iterative alignment procedure. The development  of rapid autotuning procedures to measure and then correct misalignments and  aberrations will be an important step in meeting the challenges of the TEAM  project.</p>
