      <h2><font size="3" face="Arial">Introduction</font></h2>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Since the development of cochlear implants
      in the 1960s, more than 3,000 persons--children and adults--have been
      implanted with a variety of these devices. Controversy exists on several
      issues, including determination of appropriate candidates, selection of a
      single-channel or multichannel device, suitable preimplantation and
      postimplantation assessments, and rehabilitation procedures.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some reports have claimed a spectacular
      return of hearing in deaf persons with cochlear implants. Unfortunately,
      to date, no person can be documented to have had normal hearing restored
      by this device. On the other hand, the cochlear implant does provide
      significant benefits for some in a variety of ways.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Currently, we do not have the degree of
      understanding of disease mechanisms and disorders of function for hearing
      disorders that is common to other human organs and functions. This is
      partly because the organ of hearing is encased in bone and cannot be
      visualized during life. In addition, there are only limited numbers of
      qualified laboratories and scientists to prepare and evaluate specimens
      obtained after death. These methods are the essentials by which great
      strides have been made for disorders of other organs and systems.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Further, in our efforts regarding disorders
      of communication, particularly those related to language, we must not
      discount possibilities of new medical, surgical, and technological
      methods.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The charge of this panel, however, is
      appropriately restricted to the development of a consensus regarding five
      questions related to cochlear implants. These are addressed separately for
      adults and children because of special considerations necessary for the
      developing child. (A section on special considerations for children
      follows the fourth question.)</font>

      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">To address these questions the National
      Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the
      Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of
      Health convened a Consensus Development Conference on Cochlear Implants on
      May 2-4, 1988. Cosponsors of the conference were the National Institute on
      Aging and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of
      the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and
      the Veterans Administration. After a day and a half of presentations by
      experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel drawn from
      specialists and generalists from the medical profession and related
      scientific disciplines, clinical investigators, and public representatives
      considered the evidence and came to the following conclusions.</font></p>
      <h2><font size="3" face="Arial">Who is a Suitable Candidate for a Cochlear
      Implant?</font></h2>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Of the 15 million persons in the United
      States with significant hearing impairment, less than 1 percent are
      potential candidates for a cochlear implant. The selection of a specific
      person for a cochlear implant is not straightforward. There are no strict
      standardized criteria for accepting or rejecting a candidate.
      Traditionally, the cochlear implant subject has been a postlingually
      deafened adult who met certain audiological, medical, and psychological
      criteria, which differed partially from one implant team to the next. In
      general, it was considered crucial that the subject show no residual
      hearing (total hearing loss) and no significant benefit from a
      conventional hearing aid. These seemingly straightforward criteria did not
      always work well in practice, and there emerged different definitions of
      &quot;residual hearing&quot; and &quot;significant benefit from a hearing
      aid.&quot; Needs and wishes of individual subjects are also significant
      variables for implant candidacy. Finally, the issue of candidacy is
      further complicated because it has not been possible, preoperatively, to
      predict success with a cochlear implant in a specific person.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Recognizing the uncertainty about the
      operational meaning of &quot;residual hearing&quot; and &quot;successful
      hearing aid use,&quot; potential conflicts between subjects' wishes and
      objective criteria, and the absence of prognostic tools with regard to
      specific implants, the following discussion attempts to specify
      characteristics of adults who are potential users of cochlear implants.
      Because of the lack of data predicting the success of implants, the
      following stringent criteria are suggested:</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Audiological Criteria.</i>
          Indications in favor of an implant are a profound sensorineural
          hearing loss bilaterally, aided thresholds greater than 60 dB HL, 0
          percent correct on open-set speech recognition, and a lack of
          substantial increase in lipreading with an appropriately fitted
          hearing aid.</font>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Electrophysiological Criteria.</i>
          Measurement of electrical auditory brainstem responses as well as of
          middle and long-latency evoked potentials should be a basic component
          in candidate selection. The absence of neural responses to electrical
          stimulation may or may not prove to be a contraindication.</font>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Medical Surgical Criteria.</i> The
          usual candidate is a healthy, postlingually deafened adult. The
          medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are used
          to include or exclude candidates and to assist the implant team in
          planning a total program, including auditory training. There are a
          number of possible complicating factors, including anatomical
          features, that affect implantation of the device: previous
          stapedectomy, temporal bone fractures, ossification of the cochlea,
          and congenital anomalies such as absence of the cochlea or auditory
          nerve. The question of candidacy should be reevaluated after
          preexisting ear problems such as eustachian tube dysfunction, chronic
          ear disease, and cholesteatoma have been treated.</font>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Psychophysical Criteria.</i> Although
          a number of psychophysical data are available on implant subjects
          (temporal integration, gap detection, forward masking, pitch,
          loudness), none are considered critical in the candidacy issue.
          Rather, psychophysical data are critical to issues of efficacy and
          implant design. To date, preoperative psychophysical performance has
          not been a good predictor of speech recognition performance.</font>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Psychological and Linguistic
          Criteria.</i> With respect to candidacy, most psychological testing is
          done for exclusionary reasons, usually mental retardation and
          psychiatric disorders.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font size="3" face="Arial">The Issue of New Criteria for Cochlear
      Implant Candidacy</font></h4>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The field of cochlear implantation is
      changing rapidly, particularly technology, assessment procedures, and the
      significant firsthand experience by several groups of dedicated clinical
      investigators. One major result, which seems particularly noticeable as
      multichannel implants become more common, is exceptional performance by a
      small percentage of implantees on open-set tests of speech recognition.
      These results are truly encouraging and raise theoretical and practical
      questions. One theoretical question is &quot;What is the upper limit on
      performance by cochlear implantees on open-set tests of speech
      recognition?&quot; A practical question concerns the possibility for
      revising the criteria for candidacy.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Consider the following example. A subject
      obtains open-set performance of 10 percent with a conventional hearing
      aid, and the expected (mean or median) performance for similar subjects
      with a particular implant is 38 percent. Is the subject a suitable implant
      candidate? This question has several important ramifications. Revision of
      current criteria should be considered only after a rigorously controlled
      trial with a small, select group of persons has been completed. Such rigor
      is required because of the unpredictability of success with an implant and
      the possibility of decreased performance in persons who have measurable
      preoperative open-set speech recognition.</font></p>
      <h2><font size="3" face="Arial">What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages
      of the Different Types of Cochlear Implants?</font></h2>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Cochlear implants can be categorized in at
      least three important ways. Electrodes may be inserted either within the
      cochlea <i>(intracochlear)</i> or placed outside the cochlea <i>(extracochlear);</i>
      the signals may be transmitted through either one channel <i>(single
      channel)</i> or several independent channels <i>(multichannel);</i> and
      only certain features of the speech signal may be transmitted <i>(feature-extraction),</i>
      or the input signal may be transmitted to the electrodes without
      extracting specific speech cues <i>(non-feature-specific).</i> These
      methods of categorization are the most important.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Cochlear implants also may be categorized
      according to the types of electrodes used (e.g., monopolar, bipolar),
      method of stimulation (e.g., pulsatile, continuous), or signal
      transmission through the skin by wires (using a percutaneous plug) or by
      electromagnetic means.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In an extracochlear implant, the electrodes
      may be attached to the round window niche or, in some cases, to the
      promontory. Single-channel stimulation is more common in this form of
      implant. In an intracochlear implant, an electrode or electrode array is
      inserted into the cochlea. For multichannel operation, the electrode array
      is usually inserted quite deeply into the cochlea (toward the apex),
      whereas for single-channel operation, a short single-channel electrode
      that does not extend beyond the first bend in the cochlea can be used.
      Multiple electrode arrays have been developed with as many as 22
      electrodes that can be stimulated independently. Speech-feature processing
      typically involves extraction of the voice-fundamental frequency, formant
      frequencies, and determination of whether the speech sound is voiced or
      voiceless. In non-feature-specific processing, the signals are usually
      transmitted directly to the electrodes without radical transformation. In
      a multichannel system of this type, known as a filter-bank system, signals
      in different frequency bands are transmitted separately to different
      electrodes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Extracochlear stimulation, in contrast to
      intracochlear stimulation, has the advantage that the procedure does not
      invade the cochlea and is reversible. The disadvantages of extracochlear
      stimulation are narrower dynamic range, higher current density, and,
      concomitantly, a greater potential for stimulating other neural tissue,
      possibly resulting in facial nerve stimulation or vertigo. An additional
      concern is maintaining long-term contact between the external electrode
      and the round window or promontory.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The major advantages of intracochlear
      stimulation are relative ease of placement (particularly for short
      electrodes), closer proximity to neural structures, potential for lower
      current density, wider dynamic range, and more convenient tonotopic
      stimulation. The potential disadvantages of intracochlear stimulation
      include the usual hazards of surgery, insertion trauma, the possibility of
      mechanical damage to the cochlea, osteoneogenesis, possible release of
      ototoxic corrosion products, and the difficulty of replacing the device,
      should the need arise.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Several of the above disadvantages are
      reduced by the use of a short, single-channel electrode. There is,
      however, no general agreement as to the relative advantages of using short
      electrodes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Multichannel stimulation has the advantage
      that information can be transmitted in a form that is easier for the user
      to understand. Because of interactions between the stimuli of electrodes
      activated simultaneously, the number of effective independent channels may
      be reduced. Feature-extraction systems are predicated on the assumption
      that certain aspects of the speech signal can be identified as being
      especially important and that these features can be transmitted
      effectively to the electrode array. Feature-extraction systems have the
      advantages of reducing inter-electrode interference and, if the preceding
      assumption is correct, simplifying the understanding of signals received
      from the implant. A disadvantage of feature-extraction systems is that of
      possible errors in the estimation of speech parameters.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The current evidence suggests that
      multichannel intracochlear stimulation produces superior
      speech-recognition performance compared with single-channel stimulation.
      However, interpretation of the present data is complicated by differences
      in subject selection procedures among research groups and the lack of a
      common body of standardized tests. Speech-recognition performance is
      similar for single-channel intracochlear implants in comparison with
      single-channel extra-cochlear implants, and for multichannel
      feature-extraction implants in comparison with non-feature-specific
      filter-bank-type implants.</font></p>
      <h2><font size="3" face="Arial">How Effective Are Cochlear Implants?</font></h2>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Few medical interventions yield outcomes as
      varied as those for cochlear implantation. Though no persons with implants
      can be said to have their hearing fully restored, some communicate
      face-to-face with comparative ease, and even a few (about 5 percent) can
      carry on normal conversation without lipreading. The most common outcome
      is some improvement in speech reading ability. On the other hand, some
      persons with implants can barely distinguish between simple environmental
      sounds such as car traffic and the doorbell. Different studies report an
      appreciable number of persons with implants (2 to 15 percent) who may
      choose to discontinue the use of their prostheses. Despite the variability
      of these results, a large majority of persons welcome their implants--a
      reaction that is understandable and testifies to their strong desire to
      maintain or achieve some awareness of sound stimulation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Variability in results arises partly
      because of differences among the implanted persons. Although all suffer
      profound hearing difficulties, the medical, linguistic, and psychological
      histories, as well as general cognitive skills, differ widely among them.
      In addition to these factors, the condition of the peripheral and central
      auditory system, both before and after surgery, is often impossible to
      assess with any accuracy. Finally, the efficacy of implantation is
      difficult to assess because of the variety of different procedures and
      tests used for this purpose. There are simply no standardized procedures
      presently available for such evaluation, although their presence would
      materially increase research progress in this field.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">All of these reasons make it impossible to
      predict with any degree of accuracy the outcome for a particular person.
      However, despite these uncertainties, the available evidence suggests the
      following broad generalizations:</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial">Speech reading is nearly always
          facilitated when using the implant, either of the single-channel or
          multichannel variety.</font>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial">Persons who have previously acquired
          language skills and have experienced hearing seem to benefit more from
          the implant than those without these characteristics.</font>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial">The bulk of the evidence from the United
          States suggests that speech recognition performance is superior in
          multichannel implants compared with single-channel implants. This
          generalization needs to be qualified somewhat. (See Question 2 on
          Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Types of Cochlear Implants,
          above.)</font>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial">The process of cochlear implantation
          represents a major change in the person's life. A strong
          interdisciplinary rehabilitation team provides a prudent support
          system to aid in this difficult transition. Consulting and counseling
          the person with an implant and his or her family, coupled with a
          training program of aural rehabilitation, facilitates the maximal use
          of the implant.</font>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial">There is convincing evidence of improved
          speech production in some implanted persons.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <h2><font size="3" face="Arial">What Are the Risks and Limitations of
      Cochlear Implantation?</font></h2>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font size="3" face="Arial">Risks</font></h4>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Medical complications include all of the
      risks associated with surgery conducted under general anesthesia. These
      are small but finite for persons in good general health but increase with
      age and other confounding conditions.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The surgery for placement of the implant
      may traumatize the cochlear endosteum and initiate new bone growth, which
      has the potential for damaging surviving neural elements and for
      complicating any replacements of the device. There is no present evidence
      to suggest that there is an increase in the spread of infection from the
      middle ear to the inner ear caused by implanting the device. There is,
      however, a risk of postsurgical infection at the site of the skin flap
      behind the ear and of a failure of the flap to heal normally, which could
      necessitate removal of the device. The operation also may damage the
      facial nerve or the vestibular system. Most cases of postimplant facial
      nerve paralysis and vestibular symptoms appear to have been transient.
      However, data on vestibular effects of implants have only been obtained
      from individuals with intact visual and proprioceptive systems. More data
      are necessary to evaluate risks of total incapacitation that could
      potentially result from complications of implantation in a unilaterally
      functioning labyrinth in a person with other sensory deficits. Passage of
      current through the implant at levels necessary for auditory stimulation
      may cause stimulation of the facial nerve. Data suggest that current in
      the implant is unlikely to produce vestibular symptoms. Placement of the
      implant may cause a reduction in tinnitus in some individuals but also may
      cause an increase in a smaller percentage of persons with implants.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Use of the implant may interfere with the
      use of residual hearing cues from the other ear or other modalities. The
      need for replacement surgery after equipment failure or for upgrading to
      another device exposes the person with an implant to the same risks and
      has the potential to cause the same damage as the initial operation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Although there are encouraging data
      suggesting that corrosion of platinum electrodes used for 3 years was
      minimal, the effects of current passage and solubilization of metal from
      the electrode tip in the fluid medium of the scala tympani of the cochlea
      have the potential for deleterious effects on surviving neural elements.
      More data are necessary to evaluate these risks. Similarly, more data are
      needed to evaluate the potential deleterious effects of low currents used
      over long time periods or of local heating effects due to high current
      densities as could be generated by alternative implant designs.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Finally, there is a possibility of
      psychological problems developing for the person with an implant and/or
      his or her family because of unrealistic expectations about improvements
      related to implant use.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font size="3" face="Arial">Limitations</font></h4>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The effective use of cochlear implants is
      limited by a number of considerations. Some disease processes associated
      with hearing loss cause changes in the temporal bone that may prevent or
      compromise the appropriate insertion of the device. Chief among these are
      congenital malformations, whose anatomy increases the difficulty of
      inserting the electrode array in proximity to the neural elements to be
      stimulated, and osteoneogenesis secondary to meningitis, suppurative
      otitis media, and obliterative otosclerosis, which may obscure the round
      window niche and make it difficult to insert the electrode. Previous
      otologic trauma or surgery may result in fibrosis and osteoneogenesis,
      which produce the same difficulties. Another concern with hearing loss
      caused by meningitis is the small number of patients who spontaneously
      recover hearing. Because implantation may destroy cochlear structures
      necessary for normal hearing, there is a need to balance waiting a
      suitable interval to ensure that spontaneous recovery does not occur and
      placing an implant before osteoneogenesis has obliterated the cochlea.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some candidates for implantation with
      congenital malformations may not be suitable because of increased
      difficulty of accurate electrode placement and increased likelihood of
      damage to the neural elements, the facial nerve, and endosteum. Some
      congenitally deaf adults also may be inappropriate candidates for implants
      because of psychological commitments to the deaf world and nonauditory
      communication modes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Placement of an implant also limits the
      ability of the implantee in several activities. All persons with implants
      need to avoid activities that could physically damage or displace the
      implant (e.g., boxing or contact sports). Several medical tests and
      treatments are incompatible with preservation of implant function,
      including the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocautery near
      the implant, and diathermy and radiation therapy of the implant area.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It is not yet clear what minimum neural
      elements must be present for effective transmission of the electrical
      signal, although absence of all spiral ganglion cells and all auditory
      nerve fibers precludes success.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font size="3" face="Arial">Special Considerations For Children</font></h4>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">At the present time, cochlear implants for
      children are classified by the FDA as investigational devices. A minimal
      age limit of 2 years may be appropriate for cochlear implant candidacy for
      anatomic and neurodevelopmental reasons. In principle, the same criteria
      that apply to adults apply to children, whenever possible. It is
      recommended that hearing loss in children be corroborated with both
      behavioral and electrophysiological techniques. Indications in favor of an
      implant are profound sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and aided
      thresholds greater than 60 dB HL, with confirmation of test/retest
      reliability.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">A minimum of a 6-month trial with
      appropriate amplification and rehabilitation is recommended, with the
      addition of a trial for a tactile aid. The latter is recommended so that
      children may learn stimulus/response associations that will be useful in
      the later evaluation of a cochlear implant. It is suggested that the
      criterion for lack of success with a hearing aid in younger children be
      the failure to improve on a closed-set task of simple pattern perception.
      This observation should be corroborated with subjective reports from
      parents and others for younger children. Adult criteria may be applied to
      older children. As with the adult subjects, the <i>a priori</i> prediction
      of success with a cochlear implant for a particular child does not appear
      possible at this time.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The loss of even minimal residual hearing
      has far more serious consequences for a child in the language and speech
      acquisition process than it has for an adult. For this reason, greater
      caution is recommended in the implantation of children with measurable
      thresholds at 4000 and 8000 Hz. Any change in guidelines for the
      implantation of children should follow additional trials for adults.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Children have received both intracochlear
      and extracochlear and single-channel and multichannel devices. Presently,
      it is not possible to determine which type of device--single-channel or
      multichannel--is superior based on the available evidence. Even fewer data
      exist for specific speech perception tasks with multichannel extracochlear
      devices. It is advisable that children receive an implant in only one ear.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Children with implants still must be
      regarded as hearing impaired, even with improved detection thresholds in
      the range of conversational speech. These children will continue to
      require educational, audiological, and speech and language support
      services for long periods of time.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Efficacy measures, comparing preimplant and
      postimplant performance, are complicated by the continuing development of
      the children, particularly in speech and language skills. There are no
      studies that adequately separate the effect of the implant from
      improvement due to maturation and training. The interaction of cochlear
      implants with training approaches, such as Total Communication and Cued
      Speech, should be studied.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The long-term changes due to
      prosthesis-tissue interactions are currently unknown. Further, it is not
      known how the implant would affect the developing auditory pathways. In
      considering cochlear implantation in children, the potential and possibly
      long-term effects of the implant, either beneficial or deleterious, are
      unknown.</font></p>
      <h2><font size="3" face="Arial">What Are the Important Directions for
      Future Research?</font></h2>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There are numerous research issues in
      connection with candidate selection. One is the criteria for candidacy for
      prelingually deafened adults and the possible need for novel preimplant
      and postimplant training programs. A second issue is special populations,
      including visually impaired, learning-disabled, and retarded persons. The
      third involves the ear to be implanted, either the ear with &quot;better
      hearing&quot; or the ear with &quot;poorer hearing.&quot; A fourth issue
      involves the use of a hearing aid in one ear and an implant in the other.
      A related issue is the efficacy of vibrotactile devices; such devices may
      have significant utility as a supplement to an implant, as a preimplant
      training device, or possibly as an alternative to a cochlear implant in
      some persons. Finally, data on high-frequency hearing (&gt; 4kHz) are
      needed on implant candidates because part of the variance in the
      performance of implantees may reflect differences in preimplant capability
      at high frequencies.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Improved methods for predicting success
      with a cochlear implant need to be developed, possibly with tests using
      data from new imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography
      (PET) and electromagnetic recordings of auditory cortex activity (SQUID).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Standardized methods should be developed
      for the evaluation of implant effectiveness. This would then permit
      comparative study of single-channel and multichannel implants and
      investigation of alternative methods of signal coding. Improved networking
      among research groups is recommended and would clearly help in developing
      a common body of standardized tests and standardized selection criteria.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There should be continued study of
      presently implanted and yet-to-be-implanted adults to assess long-term
      effectiveness of cochlear implants.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The inability to predict who will be able
      to use implants or which signal components are critical for language
      comprehension reflects our lack of information about basic auditory
      mechanisms. To address this, we need information about many aspects of
      audition, including the perception of speech and other auditory signals.
      Appropriate measures of the integrity of the central auditory pathways
      need to be developed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">More work is needed on the effects of
      long-term electrical stimulation at varying levels of intensity, and the
      effects of new implant procedures and reimplantation in animals.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Further information is needed to identify
      the mechanisms leading to surgically obtained or spontaneous return of
      hearing following losses due to meningitis and other pathologic processes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">To further our understanding of basic
      mechanisms, there is a critical need for correlated histopathological
      evaluation of the temporal bones and brains of implanted persons and
      others with documented hearing losses from a variety of causes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It is important to develop methods to
      assess the efficacy of the cochlear implant in improving the wearer's
      quality of life and daily functioning.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There is a clear need for standardized
      tests for young children, both for the selection of cochlear implant
      candidates and for the measurement of implant efficacy. These tests need
      to be based on tasks appropriate for younger, prelinguistic children. More
      research is required on effective aural rehabilitation procedures. In
      addition, research is necessary to determine effective ways to educate
      professionals in the new technology of cochlear implants and its effects
      on implanted children. Research on the plasticity of the nervous system
      should be encouraged in both animal and human studies.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The preliminary findings of some benefit
      and the confounding effects of maturation and training indicate the need
      for well-controlled, prospective studies in children. Ideally, these
      studies should be small, randomized trials with precisely defined
      endpoints and should include appropriate audiological, behavioral, and
      biostatistical input into the design, analysis, and interpretation. These
      studies should not only control for maturation and training, but should
      compare the effect of cochlear implants with alternative methods of
      treatment.</font></p>
      <h2><font size="3" face="Arial">Conclusion</font></h2>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The cochlear implant is an important step
      in our long-range goal of understanding, preventing, and treating hearing
      impairment and resulting language disorders.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There are candidates for whom a cochlear
      prosthesis implant is appropriate. The specific type of implant chosen for
      a given person depends upon many variables. It appears that multichannel
      implants may have some superior features in adults when compared with the
      single-channel type.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In some persons there is a substantial
      improvement in speech recognition after implantation, although, more
      typically, there is improvement in speech reading.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The risks are few but definite. The
      limitations are many. Foremost of these is that implantation does not
      restore normal hearing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There are very special needs concerning the
      evaluation and treatment of children.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Finally, future research goals should
      include not only improvements in cochlear implants and methods of testing,
      but, more importantly, a search for the understanding of mechanisms of
      disorders and diseases of the ear.</font></p>
