<td>Today, I attended a classified briefing to report on the progress of
the war against terrorism in Afghanistan. This briefing was administered
by Department of Defense officials for Members of Congress to give us an
up to date account and confirmation of some of the developments in this
conflict.&nbsp; I am obviously not permitted to share with any classified
information but I am able to report on some of the developments that have
been confirmed.
<p>As of the time of this briefing, the United States Department of Defense
has confirmed the rescue of eight foreign aid workers who have been held
by Taliban forces in Afghanistan.&nbsp; These workers were initially freed
by advancing Northern Alliance forces, then extricated from hostile territory
by United States Special Forces and flown by helicopter to Pakistan.&nbsp;
<p>Currently, anti-Taliban forces including The Northern Alliance and The
Pashtun have taken control of almost two-thirds of Afghanistan.&nbsp; The
remaining Taliban forces that have not fled to the mountain regions are
believed to be "holed up" in the northern city of Kaduz and southern city
of Kandahar but are facing heavy fighting from the anti-Taliban forces
in those regions as well as precision bombing raids by United States Strike
aircraft.&nbsp; The Pentagon has also indicated that they believe to have
killed several senior leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda network during
bombing raids on Al Qaeda safe houses located near Kandahar and Kabul earlier
this week.
<p>&nbsp;While it is important to remember that we still have work to do,&nbsp;
I am confident that we will continue to see significant gains in this conflict
in the upcoming days and weeks.&nbsp; I am extremely proud of the work
of the brave men and women in our United States military and I thank them
for their service to their country.
