                May Be Linchpin in the Evolution of Language </b></font><br>
            <p> When contemplating the coos and screams of a fellow member of its species,
              the rhesus monkey, or macaque, makes use of brain regions that correspond to
              the two principal language centers in the human brain, according to research
              conducted by scientists at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
              Disorders (NIDCD) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), two of
              the National Institutes of Health. The finding, published July 23 in the advance
              online issue of <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, bolsters the hypothesis that a shared ancestor
              to humans and present-day non-human primates may have possessed the key neural
              mechanisms upon which language was built. Principal collaborators on the study
              are Allen Braun, M.D., chief of NIDCD’s Language Section, Alex Martin, Ph.D.,
              chief of NIMH’s Cognitive Neuropsychology Section, and Ricardo Gil-da-Costa,
              Gulbenkian Science Institute, Oeiras, Portugal, who conducted the study during
              a three-year joint appointment at the NIDCD and NIMH. </p>
            <p>“This intriguing finding brings us closer to understanding the point at which
              the building blocks of language appeared on the evolutionary timeline,” says
              James F. Battey, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIDCD. “While the fossil record
              cannot answer this question for us, we can turn to the here and now &#8212; through
              brain imaging of living non-human primates &#8212; for a glimpse into how language,
            or at least the neural circuitry required for language, came to be.” </p>
            <p>While non-human primates do not possess language, they are able to communicate
              about such things as food, identity, or danger to members of their species by
              way of vocalizations that are interpreted and acted upon. In humans, the two
              main regions of the brain that are involved in encoding this type of information
              in language are known as Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area, named for the physician-researchers
              who discovered them. Both areas are located along the Sylvian fissure (and are
              therefore referred to as perisylvian areas) with Broca’s area located in the
              frontal lobe and Wernicke’s area located behind it in the temporal and parietal
              lobes. Scientists once believed that Broca’s area was chiefly involved in language
              production while Wernicke’s area dealt more with comprehension, however current
              thinking suggests that the two areas work in tandem with one another. Although
              monkeys are not able to perform the mental activities required for language,
              their brains possess regions that are structurally similar to the perisylvian
              areas in humans in both hemispheres. The functional significance of such similarities,
              however, has been unclear up to this point. </p>
            <p>To measure brain activity, the researchers injected water labeled with oxygen-15,
              a biologically safe, fast-degrading radioisotope, into the bloodstream of three
              adult macaques. As neural activity increases in a given region of the brain,
              blood &#8212; and the radioactive water it carries &#8212; rushes into that region. Using
              the brain imaging technology known as positron emission tomography (PET), researchers
              capture an image of the radioactive areas, thus highlighting the regions of heightened
              activity. In this way, brain scans were taken of the monkeys as they listened
              to three types of sounds: the recorded coos and screams of other rhesus monkeys,
              and assorted non-biological sounds, such as musical instruments and computer-synthesized
              sounds, which matched the vocalizations in frequency, rate, scale, and duration.
            For each monkey, 16 scans were recorded for each sound type and compared. </p>
            <p>Although the coo of a monkey is acoustically very different from a high-pitched
              scream, the researchers found that both of these meaningful species-specific
              sounds elicited significantly more activity than the non-biological control stimuli
              in the same three regions of the macaque’s brain. Moreover, these regions correspond
              to the key language centers in humans, with the ventral premotor cortex (PMv)
              corresponding to Broca’s area, and the temporoparietal area (Tpt) and posterior
              parietal cortex (PPC) corresponding to Wernicke’s area. In contrast, the non-biological
              sounds &#8212; which were acoustically similar to the coos and screams but had no meaning
              for the animals &#8212; elicited significantly less activity in these regions; rather,
              they were associated with greater activation of the brain’s primary auditory
              areas. (The reason for this, the researchers suggest, is that these sounds were
              new to the monkeys and the primary auditory areas may be especially attuned to
            novel stimuli.) </p>
            <p>Based on these findings, the researchers suggest that the communication centers
              in the brain of the last common ancestor to macaques and humans &#8212; particularly
              those centers used for interpreting species-specific vocalizations &#8212; may have
              been recruited during the evolution of language in humans. In the macaque, these
              areas may currently play a parallel, prelinguistic function, in which monkeys
              are able to assign meaning to species-specific sounds. In addition, in light
              of an earlier study published by the same group, in which species-specific vocalizations
              of macaques activated brain regions that process higher-order visual and emotional
              information, the researchers suggest that the language areas of the brain may
              have evolved from a much larger system used to extract meaning from socially
              relevant situations &#8212; a system in which humans and non-human primates may share
            similar neural pathways. </p>
            <p>Further studies to be conducted include investigating which regions of the non-human
              primate brain are activated when animals listen to meaningful auditory stimuli
              other than species-specific vocalizations, such as a predators’ calls, sounds
              made by humans, or other relevant environmental stimuli. In addition, they are
              interested in studying the pattern of brain activation elicited by non-auditory
              stimuli that convey the same meaning, such as visual images of monkeys producing
              vocalizations. </p>
