Zones also contain values for converting bathymetric data between MLLW and NAVD88.  Zones 51 and higher do not contain a conversion from MLLW to NAVD88 although it is estimated the conversion would be in the range of 1.8 to 2 feet (55-61 cm).        Conversion values are given in both feet and centimeters.        To convert from NAVD88 to MLLW add the MLLW2NAVD_CM attribute values to NAVD88 values in cm.      Supplemental_Information:        Any use of trade, product, or
