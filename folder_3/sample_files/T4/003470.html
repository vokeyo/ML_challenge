   <b> 
<u>    Introduction</u>:
    </b>
<p>
       The goal of the barley breeder is to develop new cultivars that are
    superior to the "best" existing cultivars. This is accomplished usually
    by combining large numbers of favorable genes for agronomic and malt
    quality. Many of the gains made in plant breeding are relatively small,
    but they accumulate over time and result in the frequent release of
    improved cultivars. Thus, much money and time is invested to identify new
    cultivars.
<p>
    
       To increase the probability and efficiency of obtaining superior new
    cultivars, it would be advantageous to identify genes that have a large
    effect on agronomic traits and malt quality. Most of the economically
    important traits of barley (e.g. yield, test weight, and many malt quality
    parameters) are known as quantitative or polygenic traits. However, not
    all traits of interest are controlled by this type of gene action. In
    animals, many traits that are generally regarded as polygenic have been
    associated with a single gene (Crawford and Smith, 1964; Hartman, 1972;
    Merat, 1986; Pirchner, 1988). A major gene affecting a quantitative trait
    that has been localized to a chromosome is called a quantitative trait
    locus (QTL) by Gelderman (1975). If QTLs can be identified in barley,
    they can be evaluated and accumulated in improved lines.
    
<p>
       Two methods of identifying QTLs are available currently. The first
    method involves utilization of restriction fragment length polymorphisms
    (RFLPs), isozymes, and other molecular markers. Utilization of molecular
    marker techniques requires special facilities, equipment, and personnel;
    thus, these methods are expensive and unavailable to many barley breeders.
    The second method is to identify QTL linked to a morphological marker
    locus. Morphological markers are simply inherited genes that cause a
    visual change in a morphological trait such as kernel color, surface
    waxes, plant height, etc. Because a large number of morphological markers
    have been mapped, this method is available to barley breeders and does not
    require special equipment, facilities, or personnel. A proposal
    utilizing morphological marker loci to identify QTLs is outlined and
    discussed below.
<p>
<b>    
<u>    Procedure</u>
</b>:
<p>    
       After suitable morphological markers are selected and placed in a
    common genetic background, identification of a QTL is a four step process.
    First, a possible association between a QTL and morphological marker locus
    must be identified. Secondly, it must be determined if the association
    between the morphological marker locus and the proposed QTL is due to
    linkage or pleiotropy. Next, if linkage is observed, the QTL needs to be
    localized in relation to other morphological markers on that chromosome.
    Finally, it must be determined if the QTL is omnipresent in elite breeding
    material.
<p>
    
<center>
    Identification of Possible QTL Associations
</center>
<p>
    
       BC1 lines can be used to identify possible associations between a
    morphological marker locus and QTL. The recurrent parent should have
    excellent agronomic and malt quality and the donor parent with the
    morphological marker should have relatively poor agronomic and malt
    quality as compared to the recurrent parent.
<p>
    
       Agronomic quality of BC<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>F<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub> and BC<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>F lines can be evaluated in yield
    trial experiments conducted over two summers at two locations. Growing
    the experiments over two years will allow an evaluation of the genotype X
    environment effects. An augmented block design (Federer, 1961) should be
    the best experimental design to detect significant differences between BC<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>
    lines and other entries in the experiment. Use of an augmented block
    design would be advantageous over replicated designs for several reasons.
    Replicated yield trials would require an extra generation to increase seed
    for yield trials and would occupy more area in the field. Also, because
    of the greater size of replicated yield trials, only five to ten
    morphological marker loci could be evaluated each year for possible
    associations to QTLs. With an augmented block design, up to 50
    morphological marker loci could be screened each year. For midwestern
    six-rowed breeding material, entries that could be included in each block
    are the recurrent parent, Morex as the quality check, the donor parent,
    and seven to ten BC<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>F<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub> lines having the same morphological marker.
<p>
    
       Field notes should be taken on all desired agronomic traits (e.g.
    heading date, plant height, foliar diseases, lodging, etc.) At maturity,
    each plot would be harvested and individually threshed. Data to be
    collected after harvest could include grain yield, test weight, 1000-
    kernel weight, percent barley protein, kernel assortment and other
    characters of interest. Malt quality can be evaluated on samples of grain
    obtained from the yield trial experiments. Malt parameters to be studied
    could include percent soluble wort protein, percent fine-grind extract,
    percent coarse-grind extract, fine-coarse grind differences, diastatic
    power, alpha-amylase activity and other parameters of interest.
<p>
    
       Possible associations between a morphological marker locus and a QTL
    can be determined statistically. If BC<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub> progeny are distributed normally
    between the donor line and the recurrent parent, no association between
    the marker locus and a QTL for a specific trait should be assumed. An
    association between a marker locus and a QTL is possible if the values for
    BC1 lines are skewed towards the donor line.
<p>
<center>    
    Determination of Linkage vs. Pleiotropy
</center>    
<p>
    
       For those traits showing an association with a genetic marker, it will
    be necessary to determine if the association is due to pleiotropy or due
    to tight linkage with a QTL. To screen for linkage, a BC<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>F<sub><font size=-2>4</font></sub> line that has
    a low value for the trait in question and expresses the morphological
    marker should be backcrossed to the recurrent parent. Two spikes from
    1,000 randomly selected plants should be harvested from the BC<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>F<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>
    population. The progeny should not be selected for expression or non-
    expression of the morphological marker. BC<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>F<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub> derived BC<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>F<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub> families
    should be grown in head rows and notes should be taken on the
    morphological marker and the trait in question for each family. Presence
    of linkage can be determined using chi-square analysis. Fisher's Maximum
    Likelihood Method can be used to estimate linkage intensity between the
    marker locus and the QTL.
<p>
<center>    
    Evaluating if a QTL is Omnipresent
</center><p>
    
       Other elite breeding material should be evaluated for the presence of
    the QTL. To screen the germplasm, a BC<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>F<sub><font size=-2>4</font></sub> line that is a recombinant
    (i.e. a BC<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>F<sub><font size=-2>4</font></sub> line with the marker locus and quality resembling the
    recurrent parent for the trait in question) can be crossed to several
    elite lines. In the F<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub> generation, two spikes from at least 50 plants
    expressing the marker phenotype should be selected. F<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub> derived F<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub>
    families should be grown in head rows and notes should be taken on the
    trait(s) in question for each family row. The QTL will be deemed absent
    in the elite line if transgressive segregates are found in the F<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub> derived
    F<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub> families. If all families appear similar, then the same QTL will be
    assumed to be present in both populations.

<p>
<b><u>
Discussion</u></b>:
<p>    
       Ideally, morphological markers and molecular biology techniques would
    be combined to develop a map of the barley genome which includes
    morphological marker loci, enzymatic loci, RFLPs, and QTLs. With such a
    map, even barley breeders having limited resources could manipulate
    important QTLs. Several researchers (Tanksley et al., 1981; and Tanksley
    et al., 1982) have shown that introgression of a favorable QTL from
    unadapted material is possible. Selection for the marker along with the
    linked QTL will reduce the generations required to complete backcrossing
    and space required for evaluation of segregating progeny.
<p>
    
       Possible associations between morphological marker loci and QTLs have
    been studied at North Dakota State University (Horsley, 1988; Gonzalez,
    1990). Horsley identified a possible association between the <i>ant13</i> gene of
    DM582 on chromosome 6 conditioning for low polyphenol content (Falk, 1985;
    Hormis, 1988) and a major gene for diastatic power (DP). Gonzalez (1990)
    identified a possible association between the <i>v3</i> gene on chromosome 5 for
    intermediate six-row type (Fukuyama, 1983) and a major gene conditioning
    resistance to spot blotch, incited by <i>Cochliobulus sativus</i> (Ito and
    Kurib.) Dreschs. ex Dast.
<p>
    
       Continued research on the <i>ant13</i> gene will include determining if the
    association is due to linkage or pleiotropy. If the association is due to
    linkage, linkage intensity between the QTL affecting DP and the <i>ant13</i> gene
    will be studied. Since the <i>ant13</i> has been located on chromosome 6,
    linkage intensity will be determined between the QTL for DP and other
    morphological marker genes located on chromosome 6. If the association is
    due to linkage, it will be determined if the QTL affecting DP is present
    in barley lines having inherently low DP. If it is not, this QTL could be
    introgressed into such lines to further increase DP.
