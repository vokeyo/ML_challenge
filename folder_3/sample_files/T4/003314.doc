Abstract.--A large body of paleontological literature concerns the
importance of ontogeny as a source of morphological variation for
evolution; morphologies that appear during one stage of an organism's
development are made available for use in another simply by modifying
the developmental program.  Paleontologists need to know why this
occurs, both so they can study the process of evolution in extinct
animals and so they can discuss the fossil record in terms that are
applicable to modern forms.  If most cases of heterochrony can be
attributed to life-history evolution then the fossil record provides
evidence of the nature of selection (in particular the age-specific
mortality) that extinct animals experienced.  The hypothesis of interest
here is that species in which maturity is accelerated will also show
generalized morphology and small size, while those with delayed maturity
will have more specialized morphology and large size.

     Four species of the ostracode genus Cyprideis were studied to
determine whether differences in age at maturity are correlated with
heterochrony in the expected manner.  For each species the changes in
size and shape through geological time were evaluated in the statistical
context of modern geographic and seasonal variation.  Living populations
were sampled regularly to detect differences in seasonality and to
estimate the duration of development.

     Evolution of ontogeny is apparent at the level of species in this
group, but it is not simply related to differences in life-history.  In
comparisons among species, we find evidence of heterochrony where there
is no difference in the age at maturity, and a difference in age at
maturity where there is no heterochrony.  Similarly, three of the four
species show the expected positive correlation between size and age at
maturity yet the fourth species is relatively large and matures rapidly.
Cyprideis does not support the generalization that life-history
evolution causes heterochrony, and casts doubt on the inference of
life-history evolution from heterochrony where the data are drawn
exclusively from extinct forms.

                        Introduction

     To infer the mechanisms of evolution from fossils, paleontologists
must know how the conditions under which organisms lived affected the
processes that generated and modified their morphology and distribution.
In contrast, neontologists have focused their efforts on the evolution
of life-history traits, characteristics of reproductive behavior
considered by biologists to be the most important components of fitness
(Stearns 1976).  If paleontologists can translate the information
contained in the form and distribution of fossils into information about
life-history traits, they will be able to use the results of modern
ecological theory to interpret evolutionary events and provide tests of
life-history theory on geological timescales.  To realize this
potential, the crucial links between life-history and ontogeny must be
tested.

     The objective of this study is to test the relationships among age
at maturity and the changes in size and shape that accompany growth.  To
conduct such a test we must be able to measure all of the variables of
interest, and so we must work with extant species.  But since the
results will be applied to paleontological problems, the subject taxa
ought to have a fossil record.  Comparisons among samples and among taxa
require an understanding of the sources of variation within samples.
Here seasonal variation in one locality is used to place confidence
limits on geographic variation, which in turn provides confidence limits
for assessing change through geological time.

     Paleontologists have always been interested in the role of
development in evolution (Gould 1977), and have often paid special
attention to the occurrence of heterochrony, change in the relative
rates, timing, or duration of somatic and reproductive development.
Heterochrony encompasses four distinct processes; acceleration of
maturity (progenesis), retardation of somatic development (neoteny),
retardation of maturity (hypermorphosis) and acceleration of somatic
development (usually abbreviated as acceleration).  Both progenesis and
neoteny produce paedomorphosis, meaning that descendant adults resemble
the juvenile stage of their ancestors.  In contrast, hypermorphosis and
acceleration produce peramorphosis, in which descendant juveniles
resemble the adult stages of ancestors.  Many publications have detailed
procedures for observing, classifying, and interpreting these various
forms of heterochrony (Gould 1977; Alberch et al. 1979; McNamara 1986;
Fink 1982).

     Several authors have recently explored the idea that evolutionary
changes in development represent organisms' adaptation to ecological
hazards (Gould 1977; McKinney 1986). They reasoned that if changes in
reproductive behavior can be understood as adaptation to particular
ecological hazards, the fossil evidence of such changes gives
paleontologists a valuable tool for understanding the ecology of extinct
species.  The crucial link between ecological theory and paleontological
data is the use of heterochrony to infer life-history evolution. If
reproduction and development are closely tied together, then changes in
the reproductive behavior of individuals might affect the way they
develop.

     Gould (1977) supposed that morphology is indexed by chronological
age in an evolutionary context: species that mature late look different
from those that mature early.  Specifically, the adults of species that
mature early resemble juveniles of those that mature late.  This theory
is attractive because it links a life-history trait (age at maturity)
with observable characteristics of fossil individuals (the shape of
various developmental stages).  Gould went a step farther, theorizing
that new species arise by progenesis (acceleration of maturity) in
unstable environments because the taxa there have r-selected
reproductive behavior.  Conversely, stable environments produce
hypermorphosis (delayed maturity) because the taxa there are K-selected.
Groups of organisms living in different selective regimes should show
significant differences in the character of evolutionary change.
Progenesis makes descendant adults look like ancestral juveniles, while
hypermorphosis makes descendant juveniles look like ancestral adults
(Alberch et al. 1979).  The model is attractive to paleontologists
because geological observations are often sufficient to classify
paleoenvironments as stable or unstable; McKinney (1986) provides an
example.

     Three aspects of Gould's theory must be reformulated if we are to
apply it with confidence.  The first is its concept of ecological
adaptation. Gould's exposition was phrased in terms of r- and
K-selection, a theory of life-history tactics. Life-history tactics are
sets of correlated life-history traits once thought to have evolved
together to solve particular ecological problems.  Life history traits
include age and size at maturity, number and size of offspring, and the
timing and costs of the reproductive efforts; see the review by Stearns
(1976).  The correlations among these traits are now believed to arise
from processes other than coadaptation (Stearns 1980), and many
ecologists have discarded the theory of r- and K-selection because it
does not accurately describe the processes that produce differences
among taxa (Stearns 1983, 1984) and it does not accurately predict the
response of populations to environmental stress (Stearns 1977).  Since
it concentrated on progenesis and hypermorphosis, Gould's theory should
be specified as a relationship between environmental stress and age at
maturity.

     The second difficulty with Gould's theory is that the environmental
stresses now thought to influence life-history traits include the
probability and predictability of mortality as a function of an
individual's age (Stearns 1977).  These are not the sort of stresses
that paleontologists can detect, and require much closer observation of
the populations than does the vague concept of environmental stability
employed, for example, by McKinney (1986).  Paleoenvironmental analysis
can suggest modern environments that are analogous to sedimentary
facies, but within those modern environments a broad range of conditions
may occur.  Living organisms must be studied if characteristics of the
environment are to be included in the theory.

     The third problem that must be overcome in order to test Gould's
theory is that one must make the assumption that shape changes with
chronological age.  If an individual's morphology is wholly determined
by its stage of maturity, not how long it has lived, then changing the
age at maturity does not alter the appearance of ontogeny in the fossil
record.  A test of this assumption requires measuring the chronological
age of the specimens.  Some animals have morphological features that
actually record time (Jones 1986) but others do not.  For those animals
that do not show their chronological age, the dependence of shape on
time might be inferred from field observation or culture experiments.
Recent discussions emphasize the complex nature of this problem;
chronological age is clearly of critical importance as a growth
parameter (Blackstone 1986, 1987), but it is not too hard to find
situations in which the measure of age ought to be based on something
else (Strauss 1987).  If development is suspended for a time, as in the
present study, chronological age is somewhat misleading.

     Gould (1977) and Alberch et al. (1979) provided formal methods for
describing the evolution of ontogeny.  In general, one must examine the
relationships between size, shape, chronological age and developmental
events. When we look at the fossils, however, one or more of the
important elements is either lacking or cannot be properly interpreted.
McKinney's (1986) analysis of echinoid evolution was conducted without
direct observation of chronological age and with only one developmental
event (presence of genital pores).  McKinney equated size with
chronological age, forgoing the possibility of distinguishing
proportioned giantism from hypermorphosis and proportioned dwarfism from
progenesis.  Any change in size was interpreted as heterochrony.
McNamara (1986) made the same assumption in his guide to the
nomenclature of heterochrony.  For example, neotenic species were
assumed to have delayed maturity and thus larger size.  But the
correlation of neoteny and hypermorphosis that McNamara described is not
part of the theory but is instead a finding that must be supported with
evidence from living taxa, since the chronological age of fossils cannot
be unequivocally measured in most cases.  Neoteny is defined without
reference to the age at maturity, but using McNamara's key one cannot
practically identify cases of pure neoteny.

     Conversely, Schweitzer et al. (1986) equated developmental age with
chronological age, making it impossible to distinguish progenesis from
neoteny and hypermorphosis from acceleration. Selection on morphology
was thus indistinguishable from selection on developmental timing. There
is no way out of this dilemma, of course, unless more information is
brought to bear, either in the form of observations on the living
relatives of extinct animals or in the extrapolation into the fossil
record of general rules known to constrain living animals.

     Several characteristics of ostracodes make them particularly useful
for studies of the evolution of ontogeny.  During the course of their
development, these small crustaceans molt, shedding and completely
replacing their calcareous carapaces (Kesling 1951). The number of molts
is consistent within ostracode families, so corresponding growth stages
(instars) can be regarded as the same developmental event in closely
related taxa. Their small calcite carapaces are frequently preserved
whole in the rock record in great abundance, and because there are many
extant ostracode species, their ecology can be studied in detail.  The
molted shells form an instantaneous record of their development,
undisturbed by processes such as resorption and accretion that occur
continously in molluscs, so the shape and size of the developmental
stages can be easily and accurately measured.  Since the growth of the
shell does not leave a record of time, however, chronological age cannot
be measured from morphology alone.  Field observations are required.
Ontogeny is characterized using the average size and shape of the
instars as in Schweitzer et al. (1986), since it is usually impossible
to reconstruct a specific individual's ontogeny from the molted shells
scattered throughout the sediment.

     The ostracode genus Cyprideis was chosen because it has been
studied in great detail both morphologically (Sandberg 1964, 1974) and
ecologically (Theissen 1966, Vesper 1972, Heip 1976a,b, Bodergat 1983).
It is an indicator of Pleistocene shoreline sediments along the Atlantic
coastal plain of the U.S. (Cronin 1979, Cronin et al. 1984) and its
fossil record extends into the Pliocene (van den Bold 1976).  It is
today abundant and accessible on the tidal mudflats of many salt marshes
and estuaries (Tressler and Smith 1948, Grossman and Benson 1967,
Kontrovitz and Bitter 1976).

     Ecological studies of ostracodes have only rarely concerned the
estimation of life-history parameters.  Most of those conducted by
paleontologists dwell instead on associations of taxa with environmental
data, other taxa, or both (e.g. Gutentag and Benson 1967, King and
Kornicker 1970, Sandberg and Plusquellec 1974, Bodergat 1983).  In his
review of the literature on life-cycles of podocopid ostracodes, Horne
(1980) found most studies were conducted by paleontologists using small
monthly samples or culture experiments in the laboratory.  The only
species of Cyprideis subject to detailed study was C. torosa from
northwestern Europe.  Tressler and Smith (1948) made some observations
on Cyprideis in the Chesapeake Bay, but it is not clear now what species
they studied, since they referred to it as C. beaveni and the type
material has been damaged (Sandberg 1964).

     In the most detailed studies of ostracode ecology and life-history
ever conducted, Heip (1976a,b), Herman and Heip (1982), and Herman et
al. (1983) determined the character of the life cycle of Cyprideis
torosa from a brackish-water pond in Belgium.  Their eight year sampling
program revealed that C. torosa matures in about 60 days during the
summer months, with one generation per year.  Both eggs and young were
observed in the brood chambers of adult females.  They measured the
population density (number of specimens per unit area of the bottom)
every two weeks, providing estimates of the rate of development overall
and the duration of each of the six largest instars. In the present
study, living populations were sampled regularly using the same
approach.

                    Materials and methods

     Ontogeny is documented by measuring the size, shape, and stage of
maturity of specimens.  To measure age at maturity one must observe
closely the growth of representative individuals.  Since size, shape,
and stage of maturity of many specimens can be determined, it is
feasible to assess the extent of variability these characteristics show.
Four important sources of variability exist within the genus Cyprideis:
seasonality, geography, anagenesis (variation within species through
geologic time), and cladogenesis (variation among species).  Within
species, seasonality provides a context for evaluating geographic
variation; geographic variations that are subsumed by seasonal
variations are not regarded as significant. These two sources of
variation in turn establish a context for assessing the statistical
significance of variation within species through geologic time. Finally,
all intraspecific variation helps us understand the significance of
differences among species.

Material used to characterize size and shape.--The samples taken to
measure size and shape are listed in the appendix.  Modern samples were
taken from the surface of tidal mudflats in or near salt marshes.  The
numbers of specimens measured are not necessarily representative of the
relative abundance of the instars in the samples. However, where the
number of specimens measured is few or none, the stage was either
extremely rare or was absent; every effort was made to measure a
representative growth series of each species in each sample. Since
specimens were picked from the 150um sieve, the A-5 and A-6 stages were
often missed.  All of the fossil samples were borrowed from other
researchers.  The procedures they used for washing and separating the
specimens vary.  In many cases the 250um sieve seems to have been used,
so specimens younger than A-3 were rarely measured in these samples.

     Ideally we should examine stratigraphic sequences spaced regularly
throughout a species' geographic range.  In practice this is difficult
to achieve for two reasons.  First, the environment in which these
ostracodes are found has a patchy stratigraphic distribution.  Salt
marshes are well known as resource-recycling ecosystems, and shells of
Cyprideis often dissolve before the soft parts inside have decomposed,
some dissolution is evident even in living individuals.  Second, in
order to accurately observe the living populations in any one location,
one must sample throughout the year.  It is impractical to carry out
seasonal sampling programs in widely separated locations concurrently.
Here seasonal variability was assessed using samples collected by the
senior author at three-month intervals from Sippewissett Marsh,
Massachusetts.

     The best one can do is cover as much of the geographic range as
possible with spot samples, mindful of the seasonal fluctuations in
abundance. For Cyprideis ovata and C. salebrosa this tactic worked well.
Well-populated modern samples could be obtained from localities
thousands of kilometers apart.  For C. mexicana and  C. margarita, the
stratigraphic and geographic distributions of the samples are not
independent, so the geographic variation might be explained by change
through geological time and vice versa.  Our modern samples of the
latter three taxa come from Massachusetts and Nova Scotia, but our
fossil samples come from Virginia and the Carolinas.

Regular sampling of living populations.--During the spring and summer of
1988, samples were taken regularly from an exposed tidal mudflat in
Sippewissett Marsh, a salt marsh on the southwestern coast of Cape Cod,
Massachusetts.  From each sample the right valves of Cyprideis were
identified to species and molt stage.  Population density was calculated
by dividing the number of individuals counted by the area from which
they were taken.  Details of the sampling program and procedures are
given in Schweitzer (1989).  Since the production of new individuals
peaks sharply in late spring, each successive molt stage shows the same
sharp increase in abundance at a later date.  The offset in time of an
instar's abundance spike from that of the previous instar is an estimate
of the intermolt period, and the sum of the intermolt periods is the
duration of development.

Quantitative description and analysis of shape variation.--The methods
of shape measurement and description closely follow those described in
Lohmann and Schweitzer (in press), Schweitzer et al. (1986), and Lohmann
(1983).  Right valves were measured in right lateral view (i.e. looking
at the specimen from the outside, with the commissure flat on a glass
slide). The posterior hinge tooth was made the starting point for the
shape description function, a modified form of the phi* function (Zahn
and Roskies, 1972) used to describe each shell's outline.  This use of a
homologous landmark point incorporates some biological information into
what is otherwise a purely geometrical description of the shape of the
ostracode shell.

     Principal component analysis provides a basis for viewing
multivariate data in which a few of the basis vectors can portray most
of the relationships among the data points.  The basis vectors are
optimal in the sense that the first k principal components
(eigenvectors) explain more of the variation of the data than do the
first k of any other set of basis vectors (e.g. Fourier harmonics).  We
interpret the eigenvectors by looking at the spatial relationships among
points about which we have additional information that was not
explicitly included in the analysis, such as ontogenetic sequence,
geographic provenance, or gender.  This does not imply that the
eigenvectors are optimal for characterizing ontogenetic sequence,
geographic provenance, or sexual dimorphism--for these one would use
discriminant functions--but rather that the variation among the shapes,
which is caused by these and other factors, is being portrayed in the
most efficient manner.

     To summarize the variation in shape within instars, principal
component analysis was used in the manner described by Schweitzer et al.
(1986), and the average shape of each instar was used to represent the
instar in an analysis of the variation among instars.

     The principal components of variation among instars were calculated
using the covariances among shapes rather than the correlations among
shapes.  This procedure differs from the methods used by Lohmann (1983)
and Schweitzer et al. (1986) in that the columns of the data matrix are
not normalized to unit variance, and the mean of each row is set to
zero.  The variances of the rows are not normalized.  Consequently the
first eigenvector describes variation; in Lohmann (1983) the first
eigenvector describes the average shape.  Details of the analytic
methods are given in Schweitzer (1989).

Detection of heterochrony.--Gould (1977) and Alberch et al. (1979)
described ontogeny formally as a trajectory through the mathematical
hyperspace defined by size and shape.  Heterochrony is recognized by
comparing the developmental trajectories of different taxa, and the six
processes that produce heterochrony are identified by comparing the
changes in ontogeny with the temporal sequence of developmental events.
Fink (1982) showed how heterochrony could be inferred from phylogenetic
analysis.  Paedomorphosis, for example, is suggested by the occurrence
of primitive characteristics in taxa whose other characteristics are
largely derived.  Such an analysis requires a broader understanding of
the genus than we have, however.

     Here the methods of Alberch et al. (1979) have been employed to
search for heterochrony.  The molt stages of the ostracodes are treated
as correlative developmental events, and maturity is marked by the last
and largest instar.  The developmental pathways of two or more species
are plotted on the principal components of shape variation; the
component that is most highly correlated with the ontogenetic sequence
corresponds to the general shape factor sigma of Alberch et al.
Paedomorphosis is inferred where the development of one species
terminates at the juvenile stage of another, while peramorphosis is
indicated by the reverse situation.

     Note, however, that principal component analysis of shape
development cannot separate purely heterochronic characteristics from
those that are not heterochronic.  Sexual dimorphism and non-ontogenetic
variations among species may be correlated with ontogeny in a
statistical sense. Alberch et al. (1979: figure 10) described procedures
for removing the nonlinear aspects of shape change from a heterochronic
analysis, but in practice these other characteristics cannot be
completely eliminated.

                         Results

Taxonomy and phylogeny.--The taxonomic philosophy employed here is that
of Wiley (1981); all members of a non-branching lineage belong to the
same species.  In practical terms, this means that if specimens from
separate places look different, they are not considered separate species
unless the two morphologies also are found together.  This idea is based
on two assumptions: (1) all of the specimens being classified are
similar enough to consider the possibility of their being conspecific,
and (2) individuals of the same species living in the same place will
look alike.  (Sexual and ontogenetic variants must be accounted for as
well, but in ostracodes these forms are easy to identify.)  The error in
this procedure is that closely related species that do not occur
together are combined under the same name; cladogenesis is inferred only
when it is supported by biogeographic evidence.  The danger in this
procedure is that assumption (1) above requires experience on the part
of the researcher and faith in that experience on the part of the
reader.

     Four species of Cyprideis live in tidal marshes and estuaries on
the east coast of North America.  Each has distinctive characteristics
of shell texture and musculature by which it can be identified, even in
juvenile stages. Each shows both sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic
variation.  A proper phylogenetic analysis of this group is not yet
available, since it would require detailed morphological and
biogeographical analysis of species that live outside the study area and
of the related genera Cytheridea and Haplocytheridea.  Table 1 shows the
morphological characteristics used to identify specimens in this study.

Ecology and life-history.--The four species C. margarita, C. mexicana,
C. ovata, and C. salebrosa occur together on the surface of tidal
mudflats in Sippewissett Marsh, Massachusetts.  Regular measurements of
population density show the seasonal changes in population structure
that each species undergoes, and allow these changes to be compared with
the results published by Heip (1976b) for C. torosa. Details of the
sampling procedures and listings of the data are given in Schweitzer
(1989). The population density of each instar of each species is shown
in figure 1.

     Similar changes of population structure occurred in all four
species. Late juvenile instars present in March and April matured in May
and June, producing a sharp increase of early juveniles that appeared
later in successive instars.  Clear differences among species are
apparent as well.  The new generation produced by Cyprideis margarita
reached maturity in about two months, but C. mexicana that hatched
during the summer must have matured the following spring, since the
large sample of C. mexicana taken in December 1987 contained essentially
the same age structure as those taken in October 1988.  With minor
exceptions, all growth stages of C. margarita are present in every
sample.  But most samples of C. mexicana contained only three or fewer
instars.  Cyprideis margarita appears to mature more rapidly than does
C. mexicana.

     Cyprideis salebrosa and C. ovata occur in smaller numbers, but
their patterns of population density are quite similar to those of the
more abundant C. margarita and C. mexicana.  In particular, C. salebrosa
behaves like C. mexicana, and C. ovata like C. margarita.  Three lines
of evidence support this inference.  First, the large peaks in abundance
of juvenile specimens of C. ovata are nearly synchronous, like C.
margarita, while those of C. salebrosa are progressively more offset in
time, like C. mexicana.  Second, the large increase in juveniles of C.
ovata occurs at the beginning of June, like C. margarita, whereas C.
salebrosa juveniles begin to increase in July, like C. mexicana.  Third,
a large sample taken in December 1987 contained both adults and
juveniles of C. ovata and C. margarita, but only juveniles (and only
stages A-1, A-2, and A-3) of both C. salebrosa and C. mexicana.

     The most important environmental parameter for ostracode growth
seems to be temperature (Heip, 1976b; Herman and Heip, 1982; Martens,
1985). Ostracodes grow more slowly in cold water and may reach a larger
size than they do in warm water (Latifa, 1987).  Variations of water
temperature at Sippewissett Marsh support the observation by Heip
(1976b) that growth and production in ostracodes is slowest when the
water temperature goes below 15 degrees C, and fastest when it exceeds
20 degrees C.  That development of Cyprideis mexicana and C. salebrosa
slows dramatically through the winter months seems clear from the
general aspect of figure 1. Cyprideis margarita also shows some evidence
for retarded growth in cold conditions.  A secondary peak of juveniles
appears in August, but progresses towards adulthood much more slowly
than the cohort which hatched in early June.  The slight bulges in A-2
and A-3 instars in late September and early October indicate that this
second generation probably overwinters in juvenile form in much the same
way as does the new generation of C. mexicana.  The second generation is
not as obvious in C. ovata, due to its low population density.  The
patterns of abundance in other samples support these observations,
though the spot samples listed in the appendix were not taken for the
purpose of measuring population density, and only general statements
about relative abundance can be made from them.

     Some information about variation in the ecology of Cyprideis
salebrosa can be gained from the sample of the salt marsh at Kelly's
beach in Kouchibouguac National Park, New Brunswick.  There both sexes
and all instars of C. salebrosa occur in great abundance, quite unlike
the distribution in Sippewissett Marsh.  The Kouchibouguac sample of C.
salebrosa was taken in August of 1987.  The abundance of specimens and
their population structure are much like that of C. margarita in
Sippewissett Marsh; at no time during the summer of 1988 were all
instars of C. salebrosa observed in a single sample, but this was the
norm for C. margarita.  These observations suggest that the life cycle
of C. salebrosa at Kouchibouguac is similar to that of C. margarita at
Sippewissett.

Intraspecific variation.--Morphological variation is hierarchical.
Typically, ontogenetic variation is present in every sample, seasonal
variation is present at every location, and geographic variation is
present in every species.  In order to assess the statistical
significance of differences among samples one must first understand
these sources of within-sample variation.  We discuss each in turn,
beginning with seasonal variation.

     Some crustaceans show seasonal variations in morphology that seem
to be related to aspects of the physical or biological environment.  A
single population of cladocerans, for example, may show a variety of
morphologies throughout the year in response to changes in temperature
or predation (Dodson 1974).  The ability of populations to adapt with
such flexibility is called phenotypic plasticity; phenotypic because one
genotype may permit the expression of several different external forms,
plasticity implying that although small changes in a single individual
might be reversed during its lifetime, larger changes cannot (Stearns
1981).  Plasticity of this sort is properly considered a characteristic
not of individuals but of populations.  Though it may be an important
mechanism for producing stasis in the fossil record, phenotypic
plasticity may have a confusing influence in studies such as this one.

     In fossil samples both seasonal and interannual variation is
combined, but differential production and preservation may obscure their
relative importance.  Periodic sampling of living populations gives us a
statistical estimate of seasonal variation.  It also shows how shape and
size are affected by whatever environmental parameters can be measured,
but in field studies many of the ecological variables that might be
important can neither be controlled nor measured.  Samples for this
purpose were taken from Sippewissett Marsh on May 25, August 27, and
December 2, 1987. Specimens were picked selectively to measure fifteen
to twenty individuals of each instar of each species. Some instars were
quite rare or simply could not be found, however.  The strong
differences in seasonality shown by these samples prompted a more
detailed investigation of these species' population dynamics.

     Size was measured as the area of the outline of the right valve in
right lateral view.  Size differences were evaluated using univariate t
and F statistics.  Slight seasonal differences were found in all of the
species, the magnitude of which ranged between one and two standard
deviations of the data.  The three largest instars of Cyprideis
margarita are largest in May and smallest in December.  C. mexicana
females are larger in May than in August, but are absent in December.
C. ovata are generally largest in August and smallest in December,
though results from the smaller instars are inconclusive.  The two
largest juvenile instars of C. salebrosa were smallest in May and
largest in December and August.

     Shape was measured as the phi* function of Zahn and Roskies (1972).
Shape variation was summarized using eigenfunction analysis (see above,
Lohmann 1983, and Lohmann and Schweitzer in press).  Each shape is
plotted on the first three principal components of variation defined by
the averages of all stages in all samples, thus avoiding a bias against
rare stages. In all four species the first component of variation
describes the ontogeny.  The second and third components describe sexual
dimorphism and non-ontogenetic seasonal variations.  The results are
used to assess the significance of geographic and stratigraphic
variability.

     In one species the pattern of seasonal variation is interesting in
its own right.  In Cyprideis margarita, which shows significant
variation of ontogeny (instars A-1, A-2, and A-3 in figure 2).  December
specimens are less advanced than their counterparts in May and August.
The ecological data reported here provides evidence that the December
specimens probably matured much more slowly than those collected in
August and May.  This suggests that when the intermolt period increases,
the rate of development of shape decreases (meaning the shape changes
that lead to adulthood occur in smaller steps).  This plasticity seems
to affect only the late preadult instars, since the adults are not
affected in the same way.

     Geographic variation in Cyprideis tends to be complicated because
we do not fully understand the mechanisms by which separate populations
are established and maintained.  The best example of this complexity is
the morphological variation of the species C. salebrosa.  We discuss
this species first, then turn to the variation shown by other species.

     Cluster analysis of the average shape of adult female shells of
Cyprideis salebrosa suggests that two distinct morphologies exist.
Principal components analysis shows the same relationships among the
averages; the individual shapes can be plotted on these axes to show
that the groups described by cluster analysis do not overlap.  Note that
the samples of living material show the dichotomy most clearly; fossil
samples are intermediate in form.  Specimens from the Pleistocene of
Virginia and the Carolinas and modern specimens from Sippewissett Marsh
have a produced, slightly pointed anterior, while those from Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Venezuela, and the Caloosahatchee Formation of
the Florida Pleistocene have a stouter, more inflated anterior (Figure
3).  Specimens from the Pliocene of Haiti (Cul de Sac well) are
intermediate in appearance, and appear to be the same form as the
holotype, depicted by van den Bold (1963).  Male specimens show the same
pattern but are less sharply divided.

     These two forms are regarded in this paper as subspecies.  Their
true relationship can be established only by more thorough sampling or
by controlled experiment.  Their geographic ranges appear to overlap, so
more detailed sampling may reveal (a) living intermediate forms,
implying that the shape variation is actually continuous; (b) living
samples containing both forms, indicating reproductive isolation; or (c)
clear differences in the character of the environments in which each
form is found, indicating the two forms are environmentally-cued
polymorphs (Reyment, 1983).  With the present data one cannot choose
among these interpretations.  Because the relationship between them
needs further clarification, this paper will refer to the type found at
Sippewissett Marsh as "variety A" and the other (of which the
Kouchibouguac specimens are typical) as "variety B".

     Though not as pronounced, similar complexity is shown by other
species of Cyprideis as well.  Size varies significantly among samples
from different localities.  In general, the more southerly the locality,
the smaller the specimens.  The specimens of Cyprideis mexicana and C.
margarita from the Waccamaw Formation are larger, however, than younger
Pleistocene material from the same region.  C. salebrosa variety B from
the Pleistocene Caloosahatchee Formation of Florida are larger than
living specimens from Lago de Valencia in Venezuela.  These exceptions
imply that geographic variation does not explain all of the size
variation among samples from different places.  Significant differences
among modern samples (e.g. in C. ovata, of which no fossils were
measured) suggest that geographic variation in size is slightly larger
than seasonal variation.

     In addition to the specimens that we measured, we have studied
recent material from the Laguna de Tamiahua, in Veracruz, Mexico,
collected by P. A. Sandberg as part of his 1964 monograph on Cyprideis
and deposited in the U.S. National Museum.  These specimens of C.
salebrosa, C. ovata, and C. mexicana are uniformly smaller than those
found on the Atlantic coast.  The size of the adult Mexican C.
salebrosa, for example, is about the same as the specimens from Lago de
Valencia, Venezuela; the largest of these is smaller than the smallest
of the Canadian adults. Every species of Cyprideis from the Caribbean
and Gulf of Mexico is smaller there than to the north along the Atlantic
coast.

     Seasonal variability provides a context in which we can judge the
significance of geographic variation; we need not try to explain
differences smaller than the seasonal variation in Sippewissett Marsh.
In this sense seasonal variation in shape accounts for most of the
intraspecific variation shown by these species.  Prominent exceptions
are specimens of C. mexicana from the Waccamaw Formation and the
Pliocene and Pleistocene specimens of C. salebrosa variety A.
Pleistocene samples of adult Cyprideis margarita from the Princess Anne
terrace formation and the Waccamaw Formation do not fall within the
scatter defined by seasonal variation, yet material from the nearby
Silver Bluff terrace formation does.  Adult female C. ovata from San
Salvador are more like male C. ovata than are specimens from other
places, but the other instars from the same locality are not
statistically different from specimens found in Massachusetts.  Details
of the shape variability shown by each species are given in Schweitzer
(1989).

     In addition to the shape of the outline, several other
characteristics distinguish the specimens of Cyprideis mexicana of the
Waccamaw Formation from more modern specimens.  Those from the Waccamaw
Formation possess four to five blunt anteromarginal denticles like the
denticles frequently observed in modern C. salebrosa and in C. floridana
from the Duplin Formation.  The Waccamaw specimens also possess a
posteroventral flange, a feature typical of modern C. salebrosa and C.
ovata but lacking in modern C. mexicana.  Cyprideis mexicana from the
Waccamaw Formation appears to be a morphological intermediate; a
population with the size, shape, and other characteristics of C.
mexicana showing a few of the characteristics of C. floridana of the
Duplin Formation and C. salebrosa of the Caloosahatchee Formation.
Likewise the fossil specimens of C. salebrosa are morphologically
intermediate with respect to the two living morphologies as shown above.
These observations suggest that C. mexicana evolved from either C.
floridana or C. salebrosa in the early Pleistocene, and that
considerable anagenesis (morphological change through time without
forming separate taxonomic entities) has occurred in the history of the
species C. salebrosa.  The earliest known occurrence of Cyprideis
margarita is in the Waccamaw Formation, and though its shape is similar
to C. mexicana, fossil specimens intermediate in other morphological
characters have not been described. Evidence of the stratigraphic record
of Cyprideis in the Caribbean region (van den Bold 1976) seems to
indicate a Caribbean origin for C. salebrosa and C. ovata, but not for
C. mexicana, which is not found as a fossil there (van den Bold,
personal communication) nor for C. margarita, which has never been
reported in the Caribbean region.

Morphological relationships among species.--Changes in size that
accompany age are usually plotted on logarithmic scales, because an
individual's size at any particular stage of development is largely
determined by its size at the preceding stage.  Figure 4 shows the
growth rates of each species in Sippewissett Marsh with those of
Cyprideis salebrosa variety B and the Caribbean species C. similis.
The two smallest species have more nearly log-linear growth than do the
larger taxa, but all are better fit by the more complicated
log-quadratic model ln S(i) = a + bi + ci^2, where S(i) is the size of
the i-th instar.  Cyprideis mexicana grows by larger increments in the
late preadult stages than during the early juvenile stages.  In this
species the A-2 and A-1 stages develop during the spring, after
overwintering as juveniles. This suggests that overwintering affects the
growth rate, but C. salebrosa variety A, the other species that
overwinters only in juvenile form, does not show the same strong
increase in size in the late preadult stages.

     Heterochrony is a shift in the relative rates of somatic and
reproductive development (Gould 1977).  It can be seen only along
directions of shape change that parallel ontogeny, by marking
developmental events (here molt stages) along the trajectory. Schweitzer
et al. (1986) provided a simple example in which adults of one species
of the ostracode Cavellina resembled the last preadult stage (A-1
instar) of another. In that example the difference between species was
as large as the change in shape each species showed during ontogeny.  In
Cyprideis the opposite is true; the differences among species are
smaller than the ontogenetic variation of a single species.

     Figure 5 shows the covariation in shape shown by the four species
living in Sippewissett Marsh.  This figure shows morphological evidence
for heterochrony.  It is an analysis of the changes in shape during
ontogeny that are common to each of the four species.  The principal
components of shape variation are interpreted by considering how the
species, sexes, and instars are arranged on them. The earliest juvenile
stages all plot together, and successive instars of each species are
spread out along the first principal component.  This component
therefore describes ontogeny.  The second component describes sexual
dimorphism, while the third describes non-ontogenetic differences among
species.  Specimens that are farther to the right along the first
principal component are regarded as having more specialized morphology
in the sense that adults are more specialized than juveniles.  Those to
the left are more generalized, meaning they are more juvenile in form.

     The A-1 instar of Cyprideis salebrosa is as specialized (i.e. as
far along the first principal component) as are adults of C. mexicana
and C. margarita. This relationship is apparent from cluster analysis as
well; A-1 instars of C. salebrosa cluster with adults of the other
species. Likewise the A-2 instar of C. salebrosa matches the A-1 instars
of C. mexicana and C. margarita.  C. ovata instars pace those of C.
salebrosa up to the A-2 instar, but the A-1 and adult stages fall
behind. Figure 5 was constructed using C. salebrosa variety A; C.
salebrosa variety B shows the same heterochronic relationship to C.
mexicana and C. margarita but to a lesser extent.

     Cyprideis salebrosa is peramorphic relative to both C. mexicana and
C. margarita, but the morphological relationship between the latter two
species does not indicate heterochrony.  These findings remain when the
records of seasonal, geographic, and stratigraphic variability are taken
into account.  Cyprideis ovata is more complicated, showing early
morphology as specialized as C. salebrosa but late morphology more like
C. mexicana and C. margarita.

     Were these solely extinct forms the analysis would stop here.  The
relationships among these species would simply be categorized with the
appropriate words and speculation that Cyprideis salebrosa, whose
stratigraphic record extends farthest into the past, spawned the two
species C. mexicana and C. margarita by paedomorphosis.  But since the
life-history of each species has been examined, we know the parts of
this story that pure paleontology does not provide.  Cyprideis mexicana
and C. salebrosa mature in approximately the same amount of time, but C.
margarita matures much more quickly.  The expected correlations, that
delayed maturity yields specialized morphology and large size, and
accelerated maturity leads to generalized morphology and small size,
occur in only two of the four species studied here, C. salebrosa and C.
margarita.  Cyprideis ovata is nearly as large as C. salebrosa yet
matures quickly, like C. margarita, while C. mexicana, which matures at
the same rate as C. salebrosa, is nevertheless smaller.

                         Discussion

     Paleontologists have invested significant effort in detecting and
classifying occurrences of heterochrony in the fossil record.  These
studies are of value only in the context of a theory that links the
occurrence of heterochrony to elements of the organisms' ecology.  Such
a theory has been presented, i.e. that heterochrony is caused by
life-history evolution.  If the fossil record contains identifiable
examples of life-history evolution, paleontologists can use the results
of modern population biology to understand the workings of anagenesis
and cladogenesis over long periods of time.

     A proper test of the theory linking age at maturity with
morphological changes observable in fossils requires clarification of
its underlying assumptions.  In particular, shape is assumed to be
dependent on chronological age, but size is not.  If size is used as a
proxy for chronological age, heterochrony cannot be cleanly
distinguished from changes in size, and the results are ambiguous.
Furthermore, maturity must be recognizable in the taxa that are studied,
and sources of variation both within and among species must be
understood.

     How age should be measured is a difficult and unsolved problem in
evolutionary biology.  This study takes the point of view expressed by
Blackstone (1986, 1987) that the proper measure of age is chronological.
Strauss (1987) in response argues for a looser concept of biological
age, measured either by size, time, or developmental events.  The
ecology of Cyprideis margarita lends some support to Strauss's point of
view.  The rate of growth slows significantly during the winter, yet we
see no morphological evidence of hypermorphosis in specimens maturing
during the spring.  In what sense are the specimens that mature in the
spring (having hatched in the late summer) biologically older than those
maturing in the late summer, having hatched sixty days before?  In
contrast, a general notion of biological age leaves open the question of
how to interpret heterochrony.  Is molting the proper marker of
biological age in these ostracodes, or should we use the axes that
describe changes in shape as a continuous measure of development?  If
heterochrony can be interpreted only by measuring the mortality and
fecundity of a living population, it is pointless to study the
occurrence of heterochrony in fossils.

                         Conclusion

     We studied four sympatric species of the ostracode genus Cyprideis
to determine the seasonal and geographic variation in size and shape,
the record of change through geological time, and the dynamics of
population growth.  Figure 6 shows the expected correlations among the
rates of growth, development, and maturation as well as the correlations
observed in this study.  In general, we expect accelerated maturity to
yield generalized morphology and small size. Similarly, delayed maturity
leads to specialized morphology and large size.  Two of the four species
studied here fit the expected pattern, Cyprideis margarita and C.
salebrosa.  The other two do not.  Although it produces only one
generation per year, C. mexicana has a pattern of morphological
development very similar to that of C. margarita.  Similarly, C. ovata
produces two generations per year like C. margarita but it is large,
like C. salebrosa.  The other two characteristics, morphological
development in C. ovata and size of C. mexicana, change during ontogeny
from one pattern to the other.  These may represent changes in the onset
or offset of growth; for example, the accelerated growth of C. ovata
early in ontogeny (which makes it parallel C. salebrosa) is "turned off"
early, retarding the shape of the last two stages accordingly.

     In higher taxa, heterochrony is a mechanism that affects the degree
of specialization, i.e. the precision with which morphology fits
particular environmental circumstances.  Paedomorphosis is, in effect,
escape from specialization, while peramorphosis increases
specialization.  At the scale of populations and species, the
significance of heterochrony is still not well understood.  Where it is
caused by life-history evolution, occurrences of heterochrony can be
interpreted using modern ecological theory.  But modern ecological
theory deals with age-specific mortality and fecundity; if age
determines neither size nor shape and no independent estimate of age at
maturity is available, heterochrony in fossils cannot be interpreted as
life-history evolution.  The findings of this research indicate at least
that heterochrony is not always the result of life-history evolution.

     Paleontologists may apply modern ecological theory to fossils, but
only if they can observe the relevant aspects of the timing of growth
and maturation.  For many taxa the necessary information can be obtained
only by studying living representatives.

as a function of instar number, ending at the terminal adult stage.
Bimodality in the adult stage is due to sexual dimorphism, most
pronounced in C. similis.  The curved line shows the quadratic
regression of log size on instar number, calculated for the six preadult
instars, since adults do not generally fit this model.

Figure 5. Shape variation among species of Cyprideis. Axes are the first
three principal components of shape variation computed from the average
shape of each instar of the species C. margarita, C. mexicana, C. ovata,
and C. salebrosa.  Adult female specimens are marked with filled
symbols, adult males are marked with open symbols.  The meaning of such
principal components is inferred from the distribution on the graph of
characteristics that were not explicitly included in the analysis, i.e.
species identification, gender, and ontogenetic stage of the specimens.
The first principal component (PC I) is highly correlated with ontogeny,
the second with gender.  The third describes non-developmental
differences among species.

Figure 6. Summary of interspecific variation of morphology and ecology.
Under assumptions commonly used by paleontologists, accelerated maturity
leads to generalized morphology and small size, while delayed maturity
leads to specialized morphology and large size.  Two species studied
here fit the expected pattern (Cyprideis margarita and C. salebrosa),
while the other two do not.  Parentheses indicate patterns that change
from one category to the other during ontogeny.
