[Docket No. 2002-NM-225-AD]
RIN 2120-AA64

 
Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Model Beech 400A and 400T 
Series Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness 
directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Model Beech 400A 
and 400T series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection to 
determine the part number of the A194 roll trim printed circuit board 
(PCB), and replacement of certain PCBs with improved parts. This action 
is necessary to prevent intermittent sticking of the relays on the PCB 
in either the open or closed position, which could result in an out-of-
trim condition that could require using considerable control wheel 
force to keep the wings level, and consequent reduced controllability 
of the airplane. This action is intended to address the identified 
unsafe condition.

DATES: Comments must be received by December 19, 2003.

ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-114,

Discussion

    The FAA has received reports indicating that the roll trim tab on 
certain Raytheon Model Beech 400A and 400T series airplanes operated to 
a fully deflected position while the other trim tab remained in 
neutral. This condition can be caused by premature failure of the 
relays used on the existing printed circuit board (PCB), which may 
stick intermittently in either the open or closed position. In most of 
the cases reported, the autopilot was engaged. In some instances, the 
flightcrew is alerted to this condition by the illumination of a 
yellow, boxed letter ``A'' annunciator on the primary flight display 
(PFD) and/or slow rotation of the control wheel away from the neutral 
position. The annunciator on the PFD indicates the spoiler servo torque 
load is high and may indicate an out-of-trim condition.
    Reports indicate that flightcrew action is to disengage the 
autopilot and attempt to manually retrim the fully deflected roll trim 
tab. The flightcrews have reported to the manufacturer that this method 
has proven to be ineffective in some cases due to no movement from the 
deflected trim tab or no movement from the opposite trim tab. Recently, 
one crew reported that both trim tabs became fully deflected in 
opposite directions when the flightcrew attempted to trim one of the 
tabs from the neutral position. The resultant condition required high 
spoiler surface deflection angles to compensate for the out-of-trim 
condition while at cruise.
    Intermittent sticking of the relays on the PCB in either the open 
or closed position could result in the roll trim tab operating to a 
fully deflected position while the other trim tab remained in neutral, 
which could result in an out-of-trim condition that could require using 
considerable control wheel force to keep the wings level, and 
consequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

Explanation of Relevant Service Information

    The FAA has reviewed and approved Raytheon Service Bulletin SB 27-
3464, dated December 2001, which describes procedures for an inspection 
to determine the part number of the A194 roll trim PCB, and replacement 
of certain PCBs with improved parts that have demonstrated longer 
operational capability. Accomplishment of the actions specified in the 
service bulletin is intended to adequately address the identified 
unsafe condition.

Explanation of Requirements of Proposed AD

    Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to 
exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the 
proposed AD would require accomplishment of the actions specified in 
the service bulletin described previously, except as discussed below.

Difference Between the Service Bulletin and This Proposed AD

    The service bulletin specifies that the appropriate part number for 
the replacement PCB is 128-364122-7; however, this AD allows 
installation of replacement PCBs having part number 128-364122-7 or 
higher (i.e., 128-364122-9, -11, etc.).

Cost Impact

    There are approximately 467 airplanes of the affected design in the 
worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 430 airplanes of U.S. registry 
would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and 
that the average labor rate is $65 per work hour. Based on these 
figures, the cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is 
estimated to be $27,950, or $65 per airplane.
    The cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that 
no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of 
this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in 
the future if this proposed AD were not adopted. The cost impact 
figures discussed in AD rulemaking actions represent only the time 
necessary to perform the specific actions actually required by the AD. 
These figures typically do not include incidental costs, such as the 
time required to gain access and close up, planning time, or time 
necessitated by other administrative actions.

Regulatory Impact

    The regulations proposed herein would not have a substantial direct 
effect on the States, on the relationship between the national 
Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, it 
is determined that this proposal would not have federalism implications 
under Executive Order 13132.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed 
regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, 
positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under 
the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft 
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules 
Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39

    Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.

The Proposed Amendment

    Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the 
Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 
part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as 
follows:

PART 39--AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES

    1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.

Sec.  39.13  [Amended]

    2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new 
airworthiness directive:

Raytheon Aircraft Company (Formerly Beech): Docket 2002-NM-225-AD.

    Applicability: Model Beech 400A series airplanes having serial 
numbers RK-45, and RK-49 through RK-322 inclusive; and Model 400T 
series airplanes having serial numbers TT-1 through TT-180 
inclusive, and TX-1 through TX-12 inclusive; certificated in any 
category.

[[Page 62417]]

    Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished 
previously.
    To prevent intermittent sticking of the relays on the roll trim 
printed circuit board (PCB) in either the open or closed position, 
which could result in an out-of-trim condition that could require 
using considerable control wheel force to keep the wings level, and 
consequent reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the 
following:

Inspection and Replacement, if Necessary

    (a) Within 200 flight hours or 6 months after the effective date 
of this AD, whichever occurs first, perform an inspection to 
determine the part number of the A194 roll trim PCB, in accordance 
with Raytheon Service Bulletin SB 27-3464, dated December 2001.
    (1) If the A194 roll trim PCB has a part number of 128-364122-7 
or higher (i.e., 128-364122-9, -11, etc.): No further action is 
required by this paragraph.
    (2) If the A194 roll trim PCB does not have a part number of 
128-364122-7 or higher: Before further flight, replace the A194 roll 
trim PCB with a PCB having a part number of 128-364122-7 or higher, 
in accordance with the service bulletin.

Parts Installation

    (b) As of the effective date of this AD, no person may install 
on any airplane an A194 roll trim PCB having part number 128-364122-
1 or 128-364122-5.

Alternative Methods of Compliance

    (c) In accordance with 14 CFR 39.19, the Manager, Wichita 
Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, is authorized to approve 
alternative methods of compliance for this AD.

    Issued in Renton, Washington, on October 29, 2003.
