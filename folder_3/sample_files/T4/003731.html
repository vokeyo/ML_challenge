                      6. COMPOUNDING RULES

                (See also ``Compounding Examples'')

  6.1. A compound word is a union of two or more words, either 
with or without a hyphen. It conveys a unit idea that is not as 
clearly or quickly conveyed by the component words in 
unconnected succession. The hyphen is a mark of punctuation 
that not only unites but separates the component words, and 
thus facilitates understanding, aids readability, and ensures 
correct pronunciation. When compound words must be divided at 
the end of a line, such division should be made leaving 
prefixes and combining forms of more than one syllable intact.

  6.2. In applying the rules in this chapter and in using the 
list of examples in the following chapter, ``Compounding 
Examples,'' the fluid nature of our language should be kept in 
mind. Word forms constantly undergo modification. Two-word 
forms, which often acquired the hyphen first, frequently bypass 
the hyphen stage and instantly assume a one-word form.

  6.3. The rules, therefore, are somewhat flexible. Exceptions 
must necessarily be allowed. Current language trends continue 
to point to closing up certain words which, through either 
frequent use or widespread dissemination through modern media 
exposure, have become fixed in the reader's mind as units of 
thought. The tendency to merge two short words continues to be 
a natural progression toward better communication.

General rules

  6.4. In general, omit the hyphen when words appear in regular 
order and the omission causes no ambiguity in sense or sound.

banking hours
blood pressure
book value
census taker
day laborer
eye opener
fellow citizen
living costs
palm oil
patent right
real estate
rock candy
training ship
violin teacher

  6.5. Words are usually combined to express a literal or 
nonliteral (figurative) unit idea that would not be as clearly 
expressed in unconnected succession.

afterglow
bookkeeping
cupboard
forget-me-not
gentleman
newsprint
right-of-way
whitewash

  6.6. A derivative of a compound retains the solid or 
hyphenated form of the original compound unless otherwise 
indicated.

coldbloodedness
footnoting
ill-advisedly
outlawry
praiseworthiness
railroader
Y-shaped

[[Page 76]]


  6.7. A hyphen is used to avoid doubling a vowel or tripling a 
consonant, except after the short prefixes co, de, pre, pro, 
and re, which are generally printed solid. (See also rules 6.29 
and 6.32.)

cooperation

prefixed noun consists of only one syllable or when one of the 
elements loses its original accent.

avoid mispronunciation, print no one as two words at all times.
