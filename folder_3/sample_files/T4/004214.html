      <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#666666" size="2">Let's 
      stay in the north country, but instead of lakes, this week's question has 
      to do with rivers. Which characteristic of northern rivers is not likely 
      to be observed in rivers in the mid latitudes or the tropics (it doesn't 
      have to do with ice)?</font></b> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666"><b>(September 
      28, 2001)</b></font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">Even 
        if you don't spend a lot of time outdoors, you've probably noticed that 
        rivers move downhill. But unless they're moving extremely fast, they don't 
        move directly downhill. They tend to take their time and wander or meander 
        a bit, taking a serpentine course that often moves more in a lateral direction 
        than in a straight line. The degree to which they move this way and that 
        has to do with several factors such as the overall tilt (slope) of the 
        land their traversing and the type of underlying rock structure. Hard, 
        resistant rocks will more likely keep a river or stream confined to a 
        channel that's fairly straight. Soft rocks and sediment, which are easily 
        eroded by flowing water, allow rivers to have more latitude as to where 
        they can move. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">The 
        San Juan River in southwestern Colorado is one of the most crooked large 
        rivers in the US. It meanders wildly, creating series of goosenecks that 
        in places nearly loop back on each other. In places, it travels a distance 
        of about 6 miles where the flight of a crow would only be about 1 1/2 
        miles. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">In 
        a nutshell, the greater the curve of the river bend, the faster the water 
        moves around it. The fast moving water collides with the river bank and 
        then is deflected toward the opposite bank, where upon it then moves to 
        the opposite bank again and begins to carve another bend. Erosion usually 
        occurs along the outer bank of a river loop, where the water is moving 
        faster. Sand and gravel scoured from the outer banks are deposited along 
        the inner banks, where the water is moving somewhat slower. As a result, 
        inner banks tend to be more shallow and outer banks steeper. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">A 
        river can be loopy almost anywhere. It makes no difference if the river 
        has its source near the Equator or near the Arctic Circle, but a particular 
        feature of rivers in high latitudes is partially attributable to the Coriolis 
        Force, which is more noticeable as one moves north or south away from 
        the Equator. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">The 
        Coriolis force results from Earth's west-to-east rotation. As Earth rotates, 
        points on the surface are moving eastward (from west to east) past a fixed 
        point in space at a given speed. Points on the equator are moving at approximately 
        1,000 miles per hour, but the poles are not moving at all, they're merely 
        pivoting. The points somewhere between the Equator and the poles are moving 
        at speeds between 1,000 and zero miles per hour, depending upon their 
        latitude.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">The 
        effects of the Coriolis Force must be considered for things that move 
        relative to the Earth, especially at the higher latitudes of both hemispheres. 
        For example, in World War I, during a naval battle near the Falkland Islands 
        (off the east coast of South America, about 52 degrees south latitude) 
        between the German and British Navy, British gunners were surprised to 
        see their salvos falling 100 yards to the left of the German ships. The 
        engineers who designed the sighting mechanisms were well aware of the 
        Coriolis deflection and had carefully considered it, however, they neglected 
        the fact that not all sea battles occur in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, 
        during the engagement, the initial British shots fell at a distance from 
        the targets equal to twice the Coriolis deflection.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">Knowledge 
        of the Coriolis Force is extremely important in understanding basic concepts 
        in meteorology and oceanography since it plays a major role in deflecting 
        winds and ocean currents. In the Northern Hemisphere, primary wind and 
        ocean currents are deflected toward the right, and in the Southern Hemisphere 
        they're deflected toward the left. In addition, geographers have known 
        for some time that many north flowing Arctic rivers cut faster into their 
        right banks (from the perspective of looking upstream) than their left 
        ones. Albert Einstein even addressed this in 1926 in the journal Die Naturwissenschaften. 
        Many of you probably subscribe to this journal - well maybe not. We usually 
        associate Einstein's with relativity and particle physics, but he was 
        a man of many interests.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">It 
        seems that although other forces, such as the velocity of the current 
        and the mass of the water, are much more significant in determining how 
        and where rivers move, the Corilois Force can't be ignored at high latitudes. 
        At low and mid latitudes, the effect of the Coriolis Force on rivers is 
        hardly perceptible, and even in Arctic areas where the land has moderate 
        relief, it's not a factor. However, in Arctic regions having little relief, 
        rivers carve steep cliffs on their western banks while their eastern banks 
        are noticeably lower. This is frequently observed on a number of the great 
        north flowing rivers in Russia, such a as the Ob, Lena and Yenisey.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">Yet. 
        there is still debate as to whether this is primarily a result of the 
        Coriolis Effect. Remember that the Coriolis Force does not operate over 
        very short distances. It has no effect on the movement of water in a wash 
        tub or wind in your back yard. Perhaps river meanders are also too short 
        for the Coriolis Force to come into play. It may be that the prevailing 
        wind, over thousands of years, redistributed soil particles, contributing 
        to the perched nature of some of the river banks in the Arctic. Nevertheless, 
        in general, erosion at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere is 
        observed to be more severe on the right river bank than on the left.</font></p>
