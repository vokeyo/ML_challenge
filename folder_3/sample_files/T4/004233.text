Southern foothills of the Brooks Range-principally the Angayucham Mountains, Helpmejack Hills, and Alatna Hills-extend across the northern part of the map area from west to east, and the east-west-trending Lockwood and Norutak Hills farther south form the south flank of the Kobuk River valley.  The west-central part of the map area is dominated by the Pah River Flats and by broad muskeg-covered lowlands along the Hogatza River; these contiguous lowlands form an elliptical basin about 80 km long and up to 35 km wide.  Farther to the east and south occur a diverse assemblage of hills and ridges, isolated low mountains, muskeg-covered flats, and river and stream valleys.  The west-flowing Kobuk River and the southeast-flowing Alatna River drain the northern part of the quadrangle, whereas drainages farther south are dominated by the southwest-flowing Koyukuk River and its tributaries.	The Hughes quadrangle is located near the south margin of continuous permafrost (Ferrians, 1965; Brown and others, 1997).  Although permafrost is generally present, it may be absent beneath reaches of the Koyukuk River that remain unfrozen in winter and perhaps beneath steep south-facing slopes in uplands near the south margin of the map area (Swanson, 1996).  Depth to permafrost generally is 25-40 cm in peat-covered lowlands, and it may be as much as 100-150 cm in well-drained upland sites (Rieger and others, 1979, p. 94-95, 139-140).  During 1941-1970, the only years of record, the community of Hughes had a mean annual temperature of -4.6oC (Alaska Climate Center, 1989, p. 184; Swanson, 1996). HISTORY OF GEOLOGIC MAPPING	Geology of the Hughes quadrangle was mapped by Patton and Miller (1966).  They distinguished four general categories of Quaternary deposits and delineated some of the end moraines in the northern part of the map area.  Patton and Miller also designated several "areas of conspicuous drift", and mapped the east-west-trending fault that cuts Quaternary deposits along the upper Kobuk valley and across the Kobuk-Alatna divide.  Pallister and Carlson (1988) subsequently mapped the bedrock geology of the Angayucham Mountains in more detail, and Patton and others (1994) have compiled a regional overview of bedrock geology and structure that includes the Hughes quadrangle.  Volcanic rocks of Tertiary age at Indian Mountain (Miller and Lanphere, 1981) are of widespread interest because of associated obsidian, which was dispersed widely by prehistoric humans and occurs in archeological sites throughout northwestern Alaska (Patton and Miller, 1970; Clark, 1972; Clark and Clark, 1993).	My Quaternary geologic investigations in the Hughes quadrangle were initiated in the Alatna River valley during 1962-66 (Hamilton, 1969), and completed during 1983-87 (Hamilton, 1989).  In addition to mapping glacial deposits and related features, we mapped in detail the conspicuous east-west trending fault of Patton and Miller (1966) that crosses the northern part of the map area.  This structure, which cuts or offsets deposits as young as late Quaternary in age (Hamilton, 1984), forms part of the Kobuk fault zone (Avé Lallemant and others, 1998).  The right-lateral offsets that we mapped at stream crossings are consistent with the dextral offsets indicated by recent seismicity along the fault (Gedney and Marshall, 1981; Estabrook and others, 1988).THE GLACIAL SEQUENCE	The late Cenozoic geologic record of the Hughes quadrangle reflects the complex interplay between glaciers that flowed south through broad mountain valleys of the Brooks Range (see Hamilton, 1981) and the barriers created by its generally east-west-trending southern foothills.  Glaciers from the Alatna valley system were able to flow farther south between the Helpmejack Hills and Alatna Hills but then were deflected sharply eastward by a broad tract of uplands north of the Koyukuk River.  A comparable series of glacial advances extended south through the upper Kobuk drainage system, but only the older and larger glaciers were able to flow southward through and around the Lockwood and Norutak Hills and into the southern part of the map area (Hamilton, 1989).  Younger and less extensive glaciers were deflected by those hills into a westward course down the Kobuk valley.  During each of the major glacial advances, small alpine glaciers were generated in the Angayucham Mountains and the northern Zane Hills and were also present locally on Indian Mountain.	The glacial sequence in the Hughes quadrangle consists of seven advances: these are grouped into four major glaciations that are named (from oldest to youngest) the Gunsight Mountain, Anaktuvuk River, Sagavanirktok River, and Itkillik glaciations from type localities along the north flank of the Brooks Range.  Although correlations with the well-established northern Brooks Range glacial sequence (Detterman and others, 1958; Porter, 1964; Hamilton and Porter, 1975; Hamilton, 1986, 1994) are tenuous for events older than the Itkillik glaciation, the names used on this map have value for distinguishing each major glacial advance and associated glacial-lake stage and for placing these events in a relative-age sequence.  However, range-wide correlations and age assignments should be considered tentative.	The Gunsight Mountain advance is the oldest glacial event recorded in the Hughes quadrangle.  Farther east, it filled the Koyukuk basin (Hamilton, 1969; 2002), but it is recognized only in extreme eastern parts of the Hughes quadrangle.  The drift has been highly eroded, and in many places is obscured by as much as 30-40 m of eolian and lacustrine silt.  It is best exposed on high hilltops and ridge crests, where scattered and highly weathered granitic boulders and boulder fragments can be found.  Drift remnants generally stand high above modern drainages, and also above the highest recognizable river terraces of Pleistocene age.  However, a set of erosion surfaces along the Koyukuk River in the southeastern part of the map area may be of Gunsight Mountain age.  These planar features are incised into bedrock 60-75 m above modern river level.  The Gunsight Mountain advance may also correlate with the oldest recognized glaciation of Indian Mountain, which Reger (1979) termed the Sleepy Bear Glaciation.	The subsequent Anaktuvuk River advance is marked by more continuous arcuate end moraines with broad crests that generally bear thick covers of eolian and lacustrine silt and highly organic muskeg deposits.  Three major glacier tongues of Anaktuvuk River age flowed southward across the Hughes quadrangle to terminate in large glacial lakes near its south margin.  Arcuate end moraines enclose the Pah River Flats to the south and east, and probably contemporaneous deposits of proglacial and moraine-enclosed lakes underlie high-level muskegs (unit m1 around Pah River Flats).  More fragmentary or more deeply buried end moraines outline a second large glacier that extended southward down the valleys now occupied by Hogatza River and Klikhtentotzna Creek, probably overriding the hills between those drainages.  The moraine probably dammed an extensive lake that is marked today by the broad, high-level, muskeg-filled flats along Hogatza River.  Fragmentary moraine remnants farther east define smaller glacial lobes derived from the Alatna valley glacier that overflowed low divides southwest of the Alatna River valley and extended into drainages around the headwaters of Hughes Creek.  The largest of these lobes flowed southward near the east margin of the map area; it crossed the Koyukuk River and dammed a proglacial lake that filled the headwaters of the Mentanontli River system east of Indian Mountain.  Smaller local glaciers of Anaktuvuk River age developed in the southern part of the map area; they formed small piedmont lobes that extended beyond the north and east flanks of the Zane Hills and beyond the east flank of Indian Mountain.  The Indian Mountain lobe was mapped by Reger (1979) and assigned to the Indian Mountain Glaciation.  Outwash from end moraines of Anaktuvuk River age can be traced into an extensive terrace system that stands about 30 m high along the Koyukuk River and its principal tributaries (unit tg1 on map).	During the subsequent maximum advance of the Sagavanirktok River glaciation, valley glaciers from the Brooks Range extended south into the northern part of the Hughes quadrangle along the Kobuk and Alatna valley systems.  Ice tongues of the Kobuk valley glacier extended south into the Lockwood Hills and crossed the Norutak Hills through low divides.  Another ice tongue flowed southeast through the broad trough that separates these two uplands, forming a delta-like body of drift that lacks end moraines and probably was deposited at the north margin of a proglacial lake.  Farther east, the Kobuk and Alatna valley glaciers coalesced in the lowlands east of the Norutak Hills.  Near the east margin of the Hughes quadrangle, drift of Sagavanirktok River age extends along both flanks of the Alatna River valley, outlining a glacial lobe that terminated just beyond the map margin.  Local glaciers of Sagavanirktik River age were generated within the Angayucham Mountains and the Zane Hills: some extended to the margins of these highlands, but others terminated within mountain valleys.  Glaciation of Sagavanirktok River age is not recognized on Indian Mountain, but inactive rock glaciers and other periglacial features indicate intervals of climate more intensely cold than at present that may correspond to the Sagavanirktok River and younger glaciations.	Drift of Sagavanirktok River age generally cannot be differentiated into older and younger components on the Hughes quadrangle, but a separate younger advance is recognized locally by drift and outwash (units sd2 and so2) near the northwest corner of the map area and in the Helpmejack Hills.  Drift of this age elsewhere in the map area may have been overridden and obliterated during the subsequent Itkillik glaciation.	The Itkillik glaciation had multiple phases and sub-phases within the south-central Brooks Range (Hamilton and Porter, 1975; Hamilton, 1986), but only the older advances of the Itkillik sequence extended south into the Hughes quadrangle.  Glaciers of the Kobuk valley complex flowed south through several broad valleys that cross the Angayucham Mountains and terminated at or near the south flank of those mountains.  Between the Angayucham Mountains and the Helpmejack Hills, south-flowing ice streams formed a pair of piedmont lobes along the north flank of the Norutak Hills.  The western lobe terminated at the head of a prominent outwash valley train, which is traceable as outwash and terrace deposits (units io1 and td1) beyond the west margin of the map area.  The eastern lobe formed an arcuate end moraine that encloses Norutak Lake to the east and south and that dammed a proglacial lake farther to the southeast.  The largest single glacial lobe of the Itkillik maximum advance was that of the Alatna valley glacier, which extended down the Alatna River valley nearly to the east margin of the map.  Local glaciers formed within the Angayucham Mountains and Zane Hills at this time.  Most were cirque glaciers, but a few ice tongues extended several kilometers down upper mountain valleys from their source areas.	The outermost (Phase I) drift of Itkillik age in both the Kobuk and Alatna valley sytems is divisible into older and younger components (termed Phase IA and Phase IB, respectively).  Drift of Phase IB age generally is steeper sided, sharper crested, and less weathered than drift of Phase IA and, within the Alatna valley, it is associated with a separate younger set of glaciolacustrine and deltaic deposits.  These relations indicate that Phases IA and IB were separate glacial advances and that they probably occurred at least several thousand years apart.	Glaciers of the succeeding Itkillik Phase II advance did not extend south from the Brooks Range into the Hughes quadrangle.  However, outwash of that age is inset as terraces within higher standing glacial, fluvial, and lacustrine deposits of Itkillik Phase I.  Separate higher and lower outwash terraces of Itkillik Phase II age are present along the Kobuk River near the north margin of the map area.  These can be traced northward into the double moraine belt that encloses Walker Lake (Hamilton, 1981).  Itkillik Phase II glaciation is of late Wisconsinan age (Hamilton, 1986, 1994), but all of the preceding glacial advances are older than the age range of radiocarbon dating.CONCLUDING REMARKS	This map and a companion map of the Bettles quadrangle (Hamilton, 2002) complete a series of ten surficial geologic maps of the central Brooks Range and its foothills.  The Hughes quadrangle extends much farther south of the Brooks Range than the areas mapped previously in this series (for example, Hamilton, 1979, 1981); consequently its surficial geology is much more complex and more obscure.  Diverse individual upland areas and depositional basins are present south of the Brooks Range; each has its own distinctive Quaternary geologic history, and several have their own separate glacial records.  Very old unconsolidated deposits cover a large part of the map area.  These have been extensively eroded in some places and typically are obscured beneath thick cover of silt or muskeg.  Most of the map area also is heavily forested, obscuring surficial geologic deposits and causing access to be poor.  In addition, sediments accumulating in depositional basins tend to form "stacked" or composite units (for example, glaciolacustrine deposits draped over a buried end moraine).  Stacked units have been designated where significant subsurface deposits are evident in bluff exposures or can be inferred from physiography, erratic boulders, or other indirect evidence.  They are designated by slashes (for example, agl/ad), which indicate that deposits of the first unit overlie known or inferred deposits of the second unit.REFERENCES CITEDAlaska Climate Center, 1989, Alaska climate summaries (2nd ed.): Anchorage, University of Alaska Arctic Environmental Information and Data Center, Alaska Climate Center Technical Note 5, 478 p.Avé Lallemant, H.G., Gottschalk, R.R., Sisson, V.B., and Oldow, J.S., 1998, Structural analysis of the Kobuk fault zone, north-central Alaska, in Oldow, J.S., and Avé Lallemant, H.G., eds., Architecture of the central Brooks Range fold and thrust belt, arctic Alaska: Geological Society of America Special Paper 324, p. 261-268.Brown, Jerry, Ferrians, O.J., Jr., Heginbottom, J.A.., and Melnikov, E.S., 1997, Circum-Arctic map of permafrost and ground-ice conditions: U.S. Geological Survey Circum-Pacific Map Series CP-45, scale 1:10,000,000, 1 sheet.Clark, D.W., 1972, Archaeology of the Batza Téna obsidian source, west-central Alaska: Fairbanks, Anthropological Papers of the University of Alaska, v. 15, no. 2, p. 1-21.Clark, D.W., and Clark, A.M., 1993, Batza Téna-Archaeology at an Alaskan obsidian source: Hull, Quebec, Canadian Museum of Civilization, Archaeological Survey of Canada, Mercury Series Paper 147, 315 p.Detterman, R.L., Bowsher, A.L., and Dutro, J.T., Jr., 1958, Glaciation on the arctic slope of the Brooks Range, northern Alaska: Arctic, v. 11, p. 43-61.Estabrook, C.H., Stone, D.B., and Davies, J.N., 1988, Seismotectonics of northern Alaska: Journal of Geophysical Research, v. 93, p. 12,026-12,040.Ferrians, O.J., Jr., 1965, Permafrost map of Alaska: U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Geological Investigations Map I-445, scale 1:2,500,000, 1 sheet.Gedney, Larry, and Marshall, Dianne, 1981, A rare earthquake sequence in the Kobuk Trench, northwestern Alaska: Seismological Society of America Bulletin, v. 71, p. 1587-1592.Hamilton, T.D., 1969, Glacial geology of the lower Alatna Valley, Brooks Range, Alaska, in Schumm, S.A., and Bradley, W.C., eds., United States contributions to Quaternary research: Geological Society of America Special Paper 123, p. 181-223.---1979, Surficial geologic map of the Wiseman quadrangle, Alaska: U.S. Geological survey Miscellaneous Field Studies Map MF-1122, scale 1:250,000, 1 sheet.---1981, Surficial geologic map of the Survey Pass quadrangle, Alaska: U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Field Studies Map MF-1320, scale 1:250,000, 1 sheet.---1984, Late Quaternary offsets along the Kobuk and related fault zones, northwestern Alaska: Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v. 16, p. 288.---1986, Late Cenozoic glaciation of the central Brooks Range, in Hamilton, T.D., Reed, K.M., and Thorson, R.M., eds., Glaciation in Alaska-The geologic record: Anchorage, Alaska Geological Society, p. 9-49.---1989, Upper Cenozoic deposits, Kanuti Flats and upper Kobuk Trench, northern Alaska, in Carter, L.D., Hamilton, T.D., and Galloway, J.P., eds., Late Cenozoic history of the interior basins of Alaska and the Yukon-Proceedings of a joint Canadian-American workshop: U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1026, p. 45-47.---1994, Late Cenozoic glaciation of Alaska, in Plafker, George, and Berg, H.C., eds., The geology of Alaska: Boulder, Colo., Geological Society of America, The Geology of North America, v.
