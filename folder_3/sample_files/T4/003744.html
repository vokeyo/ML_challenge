<P>I.     <U>Statement of the Case</U></P>

<P>  This matter is before the Authority on exceptions to an
award of Arbitrator Roy D. Cromwell filed by the Agency under
section 7122(a) of the Federal Service Labor-Management
Relations Statute (the Statute) and part 2425 of the
Authority's Rules and Regulations.  The Union filed an
opposition to the Agency's exceptions.  </P>

<P>  The Union filed a grievance concerning a 4-day suspension
of the grievant for unexcused tardiness and failure to follow
the instructions of a supervisor.  The Arbitrator reduced the
discipline to a 1-day suspension.  For the following reasons,
we conclude that the Agency's exceptions provide no basis for
finding the award deficient.  Accordingly, we will deny the
exceptions.</P>

<P>II.    <U>Background and Arbitrator's Award</U></P>

<P>  The grievant, an aircraft mechanic who had been "tardy a
number of times," was instructed by his supervisor to use a
particular time clock to record his attendance.  Award  at 2. 
Subsequently, the grievant used a different time clock, in a
different building, to record his arrival at work.  The
grievant, who arrived at his worksite 10 minutes after the
beginning of his tour of duty on that day, was suspended for 4
days for unexcused tardiness and failure to follow supervisory
instructions.  The Union filed a grievance over the suspension
and, when the grievance was not resolved, it was submitted to
arbitration.  The Arbitrator did not state the issue before
him.</P>

<P>  The Arbitrator noted various provisions in the parties'
collective bargaining agreement, including Article XXIV,
section 5, which provides the following:  </P>

<blockquote>

<P>The employer agrees to impose the minimum
penalty that can be reasonably expected to
correct an offending employee.  When imposing a
penalty, consideration will be given to the
nature of the offense, timeliness of the
disciplinary action, the employee's length of
service, past record, nature of position, and
any extenuating or mitigating circumstances.  </P>

</blockquote>

<P><U>Id.</U> at 1.  The Arbitrator also noted the Agency's
instruction on employee discipline (NARFINST 12751.1),
which provides:</P>

<blockquote>

<P>It is the policy of this Facility to utilize
disciplinary procedures . . . in a constructive
and progressive manner for maintaining
discipline and counseling of employees for
infractions shall be considered when deemed
warranted in lieu of or concurrent with the
initiation of disciplinary action . . . .</P>

</blockquote>

<P><U>Id.</U> at 2. </P>

<P>  The Arbitrator found that:  (1) the grievant
"had received direct orders about where to clock
in and out[]" and (2) the grievant "had problems
in following those orders and did not follow
them" on the day in question.  <U>Id.</U> at 3.  The
Arbitrator noted that the tardiness resulted
from his efforts to ensure that his son attended
school.  The Arbitrator stated that although
"the tardiness was for a good purpose [,] . . .
continued tardiness no matter the reason
therefor ha[d] to be dealt with."  <U>Id.</U> at 3-4. </P>

<P>  With respect to the penalty imposed on the
grievant, the Arbitrator noted the range of
penalties for various offenses set forth in the
Agency's regulatory guidelines.  The Arbitrator
concluded as follows:  </P>

<blockquote>

<P>Your arbitrator believes that some written
warning with a copy to the Union is an
ingredient to progressive discipline called for
in tardiness cases.  Such was not given.  The
offense of disobedience and insubordination is
different and a much more serious offense than
absenteeism, and requires immediate discipline. 
Therefore, a written warning should have been
given for the absentee problem and a reprimand
to removal for the insubordination.  The penalty
given by the employer was within those
guidelines.  Grievant was obviously trying to
have the record not show he was arriving late. 
He took the chance of clocking in at a clock
other than the one he had been ordered to use
and got caught.  He must pay the penalty
assessed as your arbitrator finds just cause and
fairness under the circumstances.</P>

</blockquote>

<P><U>Id.</U> at 4.  As his award, the Arbitrator reduced the 4-day
suspension to 1 day.</P>

<P>III.   <U>Positions of the Parties</U></P>

<P>  A.   <U>The Agency</U></P>

<P>  The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator's award does
not draw its essence from the collective bargaining
agreement and is inconsistent with law.  </P>

<P>  The Agency argues first that the award "manifests a
disregard for the collective bargaining agreement between
the parties."  Exceptions at 3.  The Agency states although
the Arbitrator's reason for reducing the suspension "is far
from clear[,]" the award "is totally unconnected with the
collective bargaining agreement, which contains no
requirement that an employee be given a written warning in
tardiness cases."  <U>Id.</U> at 5.  According to the Agency, the
Arbitrator's findings that the Agency's action was for just
cause and that the 4-day suspension was within the Agency's
regulatory guidelines render his subsequent mitigation of
the suspension "essentially lawless."  <U>Id.</U> at 6.  The
Agency also argues that the award in this case is
distinguishable from awards upheld by the Authority
because, in the Agency's view, the Arbitrator "expressly
found that all of the  disciplinary penalty was for just
cause and, yet . . . still reduced the penalty."  <U>Id.</U> at 7. 
</P>

<P>  The Agency also argues that the award is deficient
because it is inconsistent with the Agency's right to
discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the
Statute.  The Agency asserts that arbitrators may,
consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in <U>Internal
Revenue Service v. FLRA</U>, 110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990) (<U>IRS</U>),
"disturb agency management's decisions involving rights
reserved to agencies under section 7106(a)(2) [of the
Statute] if they are enforcing limitations on the exercise
of those rights imposed by 'applicable law.'"  Exceptions
at 8 (citation omitted).  Although the Agency acknowledges
that awards enforcing such contractual standards as "just
cause," "good cause," or "for the efficiency of the
service" at "least arguably enforce civil service law," the
Agency maintains that the award in dispute here does not. 
<U>Id.</U> at 8-9.  </P>

<P>  The Agency also argues, in this regard, that the
Authority's decision in <U>Department of the Treasury, U.S.
Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</U>, 37
FLRA 309 (1990) (<U>U.S. Customs Service</U>) does not apply here. 
According to the Agency, "[s]ince the award does not
interpret a provision of the collective bargaining
agreement, it cannot be viewed as enforcing an 'appropriate
arrangement' under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute."  <U>Id.</U>
at 9-10. </P>

<P>  B.   <U>The Union</U></P>

<P>  As an initial matter, the Union argues that the
Agency's exceptions should be dismissed as untimely because
they were filed more than 30 days after the award was
served on the Agency.  </P>

<P>  As to the merits of the Agency's exceptions, the
Union asserts that the Agency "is attempting to reargue
this case before the Authority."  Opposition at 1. 
According to the Union, the Arbitrator specifically was
asked to decide whether the penalty imposed on the grievant
was reasonable and "to make his ruling considering the
mitigating factors and the provisions of Article XXIV[,]
Section 5." <U>Id.</U>  The Union argues that under that
provision, the Arbitrator was authorized to mitigate the
grievant's suspension.  In the Union's view, the
Arbitrator's decision reflects that "he addressed the
mitigating factors surrounding the grievant's behavior and
considered them in accordance with Article XXIV Section 5." 
<U>Id.</U> at 2.</P>

<P> IV.   <U>Analysis and Conclusions</U></P>

<P>  A.   <U>The Agency's Exceptions Were Timely Filed</U></P>

<P>  Under section 2425.1(b) of the Authority's Rules and
Regulations, the time limit for filing exceptions to an
arbitration award is 30 days beginning on the date the
award is served on the filing party.  5 C.F.R. § 2425.1(b). 
Absent evidence to the contrary, the date of an arbitration
award is presumed to be the date of service.  <U>See</U> <U>Oklahoma
City Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma
and American Federation of Government Employees, Local No.
916</U>, 32 FLRA 165, 167 (1988), <U>reconsideration dismissed</U>, 32
FLRA 663 (1988).  If the award is served by mail, 5 days
are added to the period for filing exceptions to the award. 
5 C.F.R. § 2429.22.</P>

<P>  In this case, the Arbitrator's award was dated, and
presumed to be served on the parties, on April 2, 1991. 
The 30-day time period for filing exceptions, therefore,
expired on May 1, 1991.  Because the award was served by
mail, however, 5 days are added to the filing period. 
Therefore, to be timely, any exceptions to the award had to
be filed by the close of business on May 6, 1991.  As the
Agency's exceptions were filed with the Authority on May 6,
1991, the exceptions were timely filed. </P>

<P>  B.   <U>The Award Draws Its Essence from the Parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement</U> </P>

<P>  To demonstrate that an award fails to draw its
essence from an agreement, a party must show that the
award:  (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the
agreement; or (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact, and
so unconnected with the wording and the purpose of the
agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of
the arbitrator; or (3) evidences a manifest disregard for
the agreement; or (4) does not represent a plausible
interpretation of the agreement.  <U>For example</U>, <U>U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security
Administration and American Federation of Government
Employees, Local 1923</U>, 37 FLRA 1144, 1150 (1990).</P>

<P>  The Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's
award fails to draw its essence from the agreement under
any of the above tests.  As noted previously, the parties'
agreement provides, among other things, that the Agency
will impose "the minimum penalty that can be reasonably
expected to correct an offending employee[]" and, in
determining such  penalty, will consider "extenuating or
mitigating circumstances."  Award at 1.  The Arbitrator's
statement that "some written warning . . . [is] called for
in tardiness cases[]" and his mitigation of the grievant's
penalty are not implausible, irrational, or unconnected
with the wording and purposes of the agreement.  <U>Id.</U> at 4.</P>

<P>  Moreover, we reject the Agency's argument that the
Arbitrator mitigated the grievant's suspension despite a
finding that the original suspension was appropriate.  The
Arbitrator specifically stated that "some written warning .
. . [was] . . . called for[,]" but "was not given."  <U>Id.</U> 
The Arbitrator stated further that "a written warning
should have been given for the absentee problem and a
reprimand to removal for the insubordination."  <U>Id.</U> 
Accordingly, consistent with the award as a whole, we
reject the Agency's assertion that the Arbitrator
"expressly found that all of the disciplinary penalty was
for just cause . . . ."  Exceptions at 7.  </P>

<P>  We conclude that this exception is an attempt to
relitigate the case before the Authority and constitutes
mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's interpretation and
application of the parties' agreement.  Accordingly, the
exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient
under section 7122(a) of the Statute.  <U>See</U>, <U>for example</U>,
<U>Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah and
American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1592</U>, 39 FLRA 1282, 1286 (1991).</P>

<P>  C.  <U>The Award Is Not Contrary to Law</U></P>

<P>  We reject the Agency's argument that the award is
deficient because it impermissibly interferes with the
exercise of the Agency's right to discipline employees.  </P>

<P>  It is well established that an arbitrator properly
may determine that all or part of a disciplinary penalty is
not for just cause and may set aside or reduce the penalty. 
<U>For example</U>, <U>Department of Justice, Federal Prisons
Systems, El Reno Federal Correctional Institution, El Reno,
Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees,
Council of Prisons Locals, Local No. 171</U>, 35 FLRA 329, 336
(1990) (<U>El Reno</U>).  Stated simply, an arbitrator's
mitigation of a disciplinary penalty does not impermissibly
interfere with an agency's right to discipline employees. 
<U>Id.</U>  </P>

<P>  The Agency does not dispute that, under <U>El Reno</U>, an
arbitrator may mitigate disciplinary penalties.  Moreover,
the Agency does not dispute that arbitrators properly may
enforce contractual provisions requiring disciplinary
actions to be taken under such standards as "just cause,"
"good cause," or "for the efficiency of the service . . .
."  Exceptions at 8.  The Agency contends, however, that
the award in this case is deficient because the award is
"totally unconnected with" the parties' collective
bargaining agreement and because the Arbitrator mitigated
"a disciplinary penalty after having found that the
agency's action was taken for good cause . . . ."  <U>Id.</U> at
9.  </P>

<P>  As noted previously, we reject the Agency's
contention that the Arbitrator both sustained the 4-day
suspension and mitigated it to 1 day.  Instead, read as a
whole, it is clear that the Arbitrator found the original
suspension improper.  Moreover, also as noted previously,
we reject the Agency's argument that the award is "totally
unconnected with" and does not draw its essence from the
agreement.  <U>Id.</U> at 9.  The Agency's assertion that the
award is deficient under the Supreme Court's decision in
<U>IRS</U> is dependent on these rejected arguments.  Accordingly,
as an arbitrator's mitigation of a disciplinary penalty
does not violate an agency's right to discipline employees,
we find, consistent with <U>El Reno</U>, that the award is not
deficient on this ground.  As such, we do not apply here
the Authority's decision in <U>Customs Service</U>.  <U>Compare</U> <U>U.S.
Department of the Army, Army Transportation Center, Fort
Eustis, Virginia and National Association of Government
employees, Local R4-6</U>, 38 FLRA 186, 189-90 (1990) (applying <U>Customs Service</U>,
Authority rejected agency's exception that award enforcing
contractual time limits on the initiation of disciplinary
actions was deficient as violating agency's right to
discipline employees).</P>

<P>V.     <U>Decision</U></P>

<P>  The Agency's exceptions are denied. </P>
