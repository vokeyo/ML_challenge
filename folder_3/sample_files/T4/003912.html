           SENATOR KNOWS THAT. THEY WANT TO GO TO A NATIONAL SALES TAX.
           THAT WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON A LOT OF FAMILIES, SOD

           MR. BAUCUS: I THANK THE SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA. THERE IS A
           REASON, ONCE AGAIN, MR. PRESIDENT, WHY THE CODE IS THE WAY IT
           IS. AND WE SHOULDN'T GLOSS OVER THAT TOO LIGHTLY. SECOND, THE
           ESSENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THIS IS WHAT IS THE REPLACEMENT?
           AND I MUST SAY THAT THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER. IT IS PART OF
           HUMAN NATURE TO THINK THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS ALWAYS NECESSARILY
           BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE. SOMEHOW A SALES TAX OR VALUE-ADDED

           TAX OR FLAT TAX IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE CURRENT CODE WE

           BIT THAT SOMETIMES YOU GET WHAT YOU ASK FOR, AND YOU DON'T LIKE
           IT. IT DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE WHAT YOU EXPECTED IT TO BE. SO ALL

           USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE PROMISE SOMETHING GREAT ON DOWN THE ROAD,
           IT IS NOT NEARLY AS GREAT AS IT IS PROMISED TO BE. OR TO MAKE

           HARD WORK, IT IS THROUGH ROLLING UP SLEEVES, IT IS NOT

           UNCERTAINTY IN AMERICA. WE ARE PROUD IN OUR COUNTRY WITH ITS
           ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS. LOW INFLATION,
