		Abortion and the Health of the Mother</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center; text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">By Congressman Joe Pitts</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">On January 22, 1973, the United States 
		Supreme Court handed down its now infamous ruling in the <i>Roe vs. Wade</i> 
		case, paving the way for abortion-on-demand across America.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">The intervening three decades between 
		that day and today have allowed for many turns in the course of the 
		abortion debate in America.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Those of us who have been making the 
		case for the unborn child’s inalienable right to life during the 33 
		years since <i>Roe</i> have seen science support our cause on numerous 
		occasions.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Advances in ultra-sound technology have 
		provided undeniable visual evidence of an unborn child’s physical 
		development, even within the first trimester of pregnancy, soundly 
		rebutting the image of the fetus as a shapeless blob of tissue.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Medical studies over the years have 
		also produced startling evidence of an unborn child’s ability to feel 
		pain during an abortion procedure.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">These developments take the debate 
		outside of the moral context and provide concrete empirical evidence 
		that argues loudly for the right to life.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">In recent years, research has shed 
		light on still another side of this ongoing debate: the effect abortion 
		has on the mental health of the mother.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">In fact, two studies released in recent 
		months have added to the growing body of evidence showing a clear link 
		between abortion and women’s mental health.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">A New Zealand researcher and 
		self-described pro-choice atheist recently published a peer-reviewed 
		study in the <i>Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</i> showing 
		that women who had abortions were at a higher risk for suicide, major 
		depression and anxiety disorders, and drug dependence.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">A December 2005 article published by 
		the <i>BBC</i> describes a study conducted by researchers at the 
		University of Oslo that also shows increased likelihood of negative 
		psychological effects in post-abortive women.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">The article quotes an official with the 
		Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as saying, “The 
		decision to terminate [a pregnancy] may bring with it long-standing 
		feelings of anxiety and guilt.”</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">The anecdotal evidence also supports 
		the notion of a link between abortion and mental health.&nbsp; Counselors 
		dealing with women who have had abortions report widespread feelings of 
		depression, regret, and general mental anguish in their patients.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">And though studies like these do 
		provide evidence supporting a link between abortion and mental health, 
		perhaps the most surprising aspect of this field of research is that it 
		hasn’t been explored further.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">If the premise is indeed true, as the 
		current scope of information certainly seems to indicate, women deserve 
		to be fully informed about it.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">In fact, Dr. David M. Fergusson, the 
		pro-choice New Zealand researcher cited above, was led to do his study 
		for this very reason. He felt there was a lack of existing information 
		on the subject.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">According to a Culture of Life 
		Foundation article, Dr. Fergusson told an Australian radio station, “The 
		whole topic has been remarkably under-researched…there’s been a lot of 
		debate about whether abortion does or does not have harmful effects, but 
		the amount of research into the harms of abortion…has been very 
		limited.”</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">I happen to agree with him on this 
		point.&nbsp; That is why I will be introducing legislation this year in 
		Congress that will encourage greater research on this topic.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">I believe women deserve to know the 
		whole truth about abortion. &nbsp;Not just what it means to their unborn 
		babies, but also what it means to their own health.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">For too long, we have allowed the full 
		truth about abortion and all of its consequences to remain obscured.&nbsp; As 
		we head into the 34<sup>th</sup> year of a post-<i>Roe</i> America, we 
		must work to bring the truth out into the light.</span></p>
