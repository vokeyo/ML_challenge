              entry phase of flight begins approximately five minutes before entry 

              interface, which occurs at an altitude of 400,000 feet. At EI minus 

              five minutes, the orbiter is at an altitude of about 557,000 feet, 

              traveling at 25,400 feet per second, and is approximately 4,400 

              nautical miles (5,063 statute miles) from the landing site. The 

              goal of guidance, navigation and flight control software is to guide 

              and control the orbiter from this state (in which aerodynamic forces 

              are not yet felt) through the atmosphere to a precise landing on 

              the designated runway. All of this must be accomplished without 

              exceeding the thermal or structural limits of the orbiter.</FONT> 

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">The entry phase 

              is divided into three separate phases because of the unique software 

              requirements. Entry extends from EI minus five minutes to terminal 

              area energy management interface at an altitude of approximately 

              83,000 feet, at a velocity of 2,500 feet per second, 52 nautical 

              miles (59 statute miles) from the runway and within a few degrees 

              of tangency with the nearest heading alignment cylinder in major

              the orbiter is on glide slope, on airspeed, and on runway centerline, 

              which occurs below 10,000 feet and is the first part of major mode 

              305. The orbiter attains subsonic velocity at an altitude of approximately 

              49,000 feet about 22 nautical miles (25 statute miles) from the 

              runway.</FONT>

              weight-on-nose-gear signal after touchdown, which completes major

              feet, a pre-entry phase begins in which the orbiter is maneuvered 

              to zero degrees roll and yaw (wings level) and a predetermined angle 

              of attack for entry. The flight control system issues the commands 

              to the roll, yaw and pitch RCS jets for rate damping in attitude 

              hold for entry into the Earth's atmosphere until 0.176 g is sensed, 

              which corresponds to a dynamic pressure of 10 pounds per square 

              foot, approximately the point at which the aerosurfaces become active.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">When the orbiter 

              is in atmospheric flight, it is flown by varying the forces it generates 

              while moving through the atmosphere, like any other aerodynamic 

              vehicle. The forces are determined primarily by the speed and direction 

              of the relative wind (the airstream as seen from the vehicle). The 

              direction of the airstream is described by the difference between 

              the direction that the vehicle is pointing (attitude) and the direction 

              that it is moving (velocity). It may be broken into two components: 

              angle of attack (vertical component) and sideslip angle (horizontal 

              component).</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">To rotate the 

              orbiter in the atmosphere, aerodynamic control surfaces are deflected 

              into the airstream. The orbiter has seven aerodynamic control surfaces. 

              Four of these are on the trailing edge of the wing (two per wing). 

              They are called elevons because they combine the effects of elevators 

              and ailerons on ordinary airplanes. Deflecting the elevons up or 

              down causes the vehicle to pitch up or down. If the right elevons 

              are deflected up and the left elevons are deflected down, the orbiter 

              will roll to the right-that is, the right wing falls and the left 

              wing rises. The fifth control surface is the body flap, located 

              on the rear lower portion of the aft fuselage. It provides thermal 

              protection for the three main engines during entry, and during atmospheric 

              flight it provides pitch trim to reduce elevon deflections. The 

              sixth and seventh control surfaces are the rudder/speed brake panels, 

              located on the aft portion of the vertical stabilizer. When both 

              panels are deflected right or left, the spacecraft will yaw, moving 

              the spacecraft's nose right or left, thus acting as a rudder. If 

              the panels are opened at the trailing edge, aerodynamic drag force 

              will increase, and the spacecraft will slow down. Thus, the open 

              panels are called a speed brake.</FONT>

              deck display and control panel (panel F7 between the commander and 

              pilot) are the surface position indicators, which display the position 

              of each aerodynamic control surface.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">The aft RCS 

              jets maneuver the spacecraft until a dynamic pressure of 10 pounds 

              per square foot is sensed; at this point, the orbiter's ailerons 

              become effective, and the aft RCS roll jets are deactivated. At 

              a dynamic pressure of 20 pounds per square foot, the orbiter's elevators 

              become effective, and the aft RCS pitch jets are deactivated. The 

              orbiter's speed brake is used below Mach 10 to induce a more positive 

              downward elevator trim deflection. At Mach 3.5, the rudder become 

              activated, and the aft RCS yaw jets are deactivated (approximately 

              45,000 feet).</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">Entry flight 

              control is maintained with the aerojet DAP, which generates effector 

              and RCS jet commands to control and stabilize the vehicle during 

              its descent from orbit. The aerojet DAP is a three-axis rate command 

              feedback control system that uses commands from guidance in automatic 

              or from the flight crew's RHC in control stick steering. Depending 

              on the type of command and the flight phase, these result in fire 

              commands to the RCS or deflection commands to the aerosurfaces.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">In the automatic 

              mode, the orbiter is essentially a missile, and the flight crew 

              monitors the instruments to verify that the vehicle is following 

              the correct trajectory. The onboard computers execute the flight 

              control laws (equations). If the vehicle diverges from the trajectory, 

              the crew can take over at any time by switching to CSS. The orbiter 

              can fly to a landing in the automatic mode (only landing gear extension 

              and braking action on the runway are required by the flight crew). 

              The autoland mode capability of the orbiter is used by the crew 

              usually to a predetermined point in flying around the heading alignment 

              cylinder. In flights to date, the crew has switched to CSS when 

              the orbiter is subsonic. However, autoland provides information 

              to the crew displays during the landing sequence.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">The commander 

              and pilot can select automatic or CSS flight control modes. The 

              crew can select separate modes for pitch and roll and yaw (roll 

              and yaw must be in the same mode). The body flap and speed brake 

              have automatic and manual modes.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">Automatic pitch 

              provides automatic control in the pitch axis, and the automatic 

              roll and yaw provides automatic control in the roll and yaw axes. 

              During entry, the automatic mode uses the RCS jets until dynamic 

              pressure permits the aerosurfaces to become effective; the aft RCS 

              jets and spacecraft aerosurfaces are then used together until dynamic 

              pressure becomes sufficient for aerosurface control only.</FONT>

              the pitch axis is provided by the elevons, speed brake and body 

              flap. The elevons provide control to guidance normal acceleration 

              commands, control of pitch rate during slap-down (landing) for nose 

              wheel load protection, and static load relief after slap-down for 

              main landing gear wheel and tire load protection. The speed brake 

              provides control to guidance surface deflection (open/close, increase/decrease 

              velocity) command. The body flap provides control to null elevon

              area energy management and autoland and control to guidance wings-level 

              command during flat turns, 5 feet above touchdown. The rudder provides 

              yaw stabilization during TAEM and autoland and control to guidance 

              yaw rate command during flat turn and subsequent phases.</FONT>

              is in the automatic pitch and roll and yaw modes, the crew's manual 

              control stick steering commands are inhibited. In the CSS mode, 

              the crew flies the orbiter by deflecting the RHC and rudder pedals. 

              The flight control system interprets the RHC motions as rate commands 

              in pitch, roll or yaw and controls the RCS jets and aerosurfaces. 

              The larger the deflection, the larger the command. The flight control 

              system compares these commands with inputs from rate gyros and accelerometers 

              (what the vehicle is actually doing-motion sensors) and generates 

              control signals to produce the desired rates. If the crew releases 

              the RHC, it will return to center, and the orbiter will maintain 

              its present attitude (zero rates). The rudder pedals position the 

              rudder during atmospheric flight; however, in actual use, because 

              flight control software performs automatic turn coordination, the 

              rudder pedals are not used until the wings are leveled before touchdown.</FONT>

              is similar to the automatic mode except that the crew can issue 

              three-axis commands, affecting the spacecraft's motion. These are 

              augmented by the feedback from the same spacecraft motion sensors, 

              except for the normal acceleration (velocity) accelerometer assemblies,

              processes the flight control laws and provides commands to the flight

              the roll and yaw channel automatically positions the rudder for 

              coordinated turns. A rudder pedal transducer assembly is provided 

              at the commander and pilot stations. The two rudder pedal assemblies 

              are connected to their respective RPTAs. Because of the roll and

              mode at either the commander's or pilot's station by depressing 

              a takeover switch on the speed brake/thrust controller handle. Manual 

              speed brake control can be transferred from one station to the other 

              by activating the takeover switch. When the SBTC is at its forward 

              setting, the speed brake is closed. Rotating the handle aft, positions 

              the speed brake at the desired position (open) and holds it. To 

              regain automatic speed brake control, the push button must be depressed 

              again. In the manual mode, speed brake commands are processed by 

              the GPCs, and the flight control module commands the flight control 

              system to position the speed brake and hold it at the desired position.

              the orbiter on a trajectory that provides protection against overheating, 

              overdynamic pressure and excessive normal acceleration limits. To 

              do this, it sends commands to flight control to guide the orbiter 

              through a tight corridor limited on one side by altitude and velocity 

              requirements for ranging (in order to make the runway) and orbiter 

              control and on the other side by thermal constraints. Ranging is 

              accomplished by adjusting drag acceleration to velocity so that 

              the orbiter stays in that corridor. Drag acceleration can be adjusted 

              primarily in two ways: by modifying the angle of attack, which changes 

              the orbiter's cross-sectional area with respect to the airstream, 

              or by adjusting the orbiter's bank angle, which affects lift and 

              thus the orbiter's sink rate into denser atmosphere, which in turn 

              affects drag. Using angle of attack as the primary means of controlling 

              drag results in faster energy dissipation with a steeper trajectory 

              but violates the thermal constraint on the orbiter's surfaces. For 

              this reason, the orbiter's bank angle (roll control) is used as 

              the primary method of controlling drag, and thus ranging, during 

              this phase. Increasing the roll angle decreases the vertical component 

              of lift, causing a higher sink rate. Increasing the roll rate raises 

              the surface temperature of the orbiter, but not nearly as drastically 

              as does an equal angle of attack command. The orbiter's angle of 

              attack is kept at a high value (40 degrees) during most of this 

              phase to protect the upper surfaces from extreme heat. It is modulated 

              at certain times to ''tweak'' the system and is ramped down to a 

              new value at the end of this phase for orbiter controllability. 

              Using bank angle to adjust drag acceleration causes the orbiter 

              to turn off course. Therefore, at times, the orbiter must be rolled 

              back toward the runway. This is called a roll reversal and is commanded 

              as a function of azimuth error from the runway. The ground track 

              during this phase, then, results in a series of S-turns.</FONT>

              is low on energy (the current range-to-go is much greater than nominal 

              at current velocity), entry guidance will command lower-than-nominal 

              drag levels. If the orbiter has too much energy (the current range-to-go 

              is much less than nominal at current velocity), entry guidance will 

              command higher-than-nominal drag levels to dissipate the extra energy.</FONT>

              tangent to and on either side of the runway centerline on the approach

              This is called the straight-in approach. In TAEM guidance, excess 

              energy is dissipated by an S-turn, and the speed brake can be used

              1,500 feet above the ground, at which point it is rendered ineffective 

              by ground reflection. The air data system, which includes two transducer 

              assemblies attached to a probe on the left side of the vehicle and 

              two on the right side, provides pressures from which angle of attack, 

              Mach number, equivalent airspeed, true airspeed, dynamic pressure, 

              barometric altitude and altitude rate are computed. Only barometric 

              altitude is used by navigation. The other parameters are used by 

              guidance and flight control as well as for display to the flight 

              crew. The probes are normally deployed around Mach 3. The MSBLS 

              precisely determines slant range, azimuth and elevation relative 

              to the landing runway. For landing at runways with MSBLS ground 

              stations, MSBLS data become available at 20,000 feet for processing 

              by navigation.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">One other tool 

              used by navigation is a drag altitude software sensor, which uses 

              a model of the atmosphere to correlate the drag acceleration measured 

              by the IMUs to altitude. This measurement, then, is only as good 

              as the atmospheric model on which it is based. The model is not 

              perfect. However, it has been determined through testing and analysis 

              that drag altitude data are important in keeping downrange and altitude 

              errors bounded during the blackout portion of entry (from approximately 

              265,000 to 162,000 feet). During this time, the ground is unable 

              to uplink state vector corrections to the orbiter, and TACAN data 

              are not available because of the heat-generated ionization of the 

              atmosphere around the vehicle.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">Navigation 

              also maintains a statistical estimate of the expected error in the 

              state vector. This is called a covariance matrix and is propagated 

              along with the state vector. When an external sensor, such as TACAN, 

              becomes available to the navigation software, a check is made to 

              see if the data lie within the current expected range of error. 

              Flight crew controls are provided on an onboard CRT horizontal situation 

              display to force the software to accept or inhibit the external 

              sensor data whether or not the data lie within the expected range. 

              Another control on the display may be selected to allow the software 

              to use the external sensor data to update its state vector so long 

              as the data lie within the expected range.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">About five 

              minutes before entry interface, the crew adjusts the software to 

              major mode 304. During this mode, which lasts until TAEM interface, 

              five CRTs become available sequentially and are used to monitor 

              auto guidance and the orbiter trajectory compared to the planned 

              entry profile. The five displays are identical except for the central 

              plot, which shows the orbiter's velocity versus range or energy/weight 

              versus range with a changing scale as the orbiter approaches the 

              landing site. This plot also includes static background lines that 

              allow the crew to monitor the orbiter's progression compared to 

              planned entry profiles.</FONT>

            
</P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">Once TAEM interface 

              is reached, the software automatically makes a transition to major 

              mode 305. The CRT vertical situation 1 display then becomes available. 

              It includes a central plot of orbiter altitude with respect to range. 

              This plot has three background lines that represent the nominal 

              altitude versus range profile, a dynamic pressure limit in guidance 

              profile and a maximum lift-over-drag profile. At 30,000 feet, the 

              scale and title on the display change to vertical situation 2, and 

              the display is used through landing. When the approach and landing 

              interface conditions are met, a flashing A/L appears on the display.</FONT>

              CRT display used during entry is the horizontal situation. In addition 

              to providing insight into and control over navigation parameters, 

              this display gives the crew orbiter position and heading information 

              once the orbiter is below 200,000 feet.</FONT>
