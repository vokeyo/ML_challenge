    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Resolution Number 207 directed the Auditor
    General's Office to complete a program audit of the new universal screening program by
    June 30, 1998, to determine the cost effectiveness of the universal screening mandate.
    This mandate became effective July 1, 1996, when the Nursing Home Care Act was amended to
    require universal prescreening for all individuals seeking admission to a nursing facility
    (210 ILCS 45/2-201.5). Responsibility for the mandate is shared among the Departments on
    Aging, Human Services, and Public Health. In our review of the new program we determined
    that: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In its first year, the universal screening program at the Department on Aging appears to
        have been cost effective for individuals aged 60 and over. Even though only a small
        proportion of individuals screened were deflected from nursing facility care to less
        expensive community based care, we estimate that during Fiscal Year 1997, the State may
        have saved approximately $2.8 million as a result of Aging's screenings. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to this new requirement, the Department on Aging did 332 percent more nursing
        facility prescreenings during Fiscal Year 1997 than in the prior year. In Fiscal Year
        1997, Aging paid for 62,747 screenings performed for individuals 60 years of age or older
        at a total cost of $3.6 million. Of the 62,747 screenings performed, 51,189 resulted in
        the person being placed in a nursing facility. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The universal screening requirement had little impact on the screenings for individuals
        under age 60. The Department of Human Services' divisions of rehabilitation services and
        of mental health and developmental disabilities are responsible for these screenings. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The Department of Public Health had not established a control to assure that all
        individuals admitted to nursing facilities are screened as required by law to determine
        the need for nursing facility services prior to admission. </li>

    <p><b>The Nursing Home Care Act now requires screenings for all individuals seeking
    admission to a nursing facility, regardless of payment source.</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top" width="70%"><p align="center"><b><br>
    <u>FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS</u></b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>REPORT CONCLUSIONS </b></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universal screening program was mandated by Public Act
    89-21 and requires that all individuals seeking admission to a nursing facility be
    screened prior to admission regardless of income, assets, or funding source (210 ILCS
    45/2-201.5). Before July 1, 1996, only individuals seeking Medicaid assistance were
    required to be screened, and private pay individuals could enter a nursing facility
    without being screened. Screenings for those not seeking Medicaid are advisory; the
    individual still makes the decision to go to a nursing facility or remain in the
    community. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the universal screening requirement, the
    Department on Aging did 332 percent more nursing facility prescreenings during Fiscal Year
    1997 than in the prior year. In Fiscal Year 1997, Aging paid for 62,747 screenings
    performed for individuals 60 years of age or older for a total cost of $3.6 million. Of
    the 62,747 screenings performed, 51,189 resulted in the person being placed in a nursing
    facility. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universal screening program has been cost effective even
    though only a small proportion of individuals screened were deflected from nursing
    facility care to less expensive community based care. We estimate that during Fiscal Year
    1997, an average of 741 additional people were in the State Community Care Program each
    month because of universal screening with an estimated State cost savings of approximately
    $2.8 million for the year. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other cost saving aspects of the program, including
    federal savings from delayed nursing facility care. Some other cost savings aspects are
    difficult to quantify. For example, individuals who are deflected to less expensive
    private pay home care may delay nursing facility admission and thus delay the time when
    they will need the State's assistance to pay for nursing facility care. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universal screening requirement also applied to
    individuals under age 60 seeking nursing facility admission. The requirement had little
    impact on this portion of the program which is administered by the Department of Human
    Services. These clients are screened by Human Services' division of rehabilitation
    services or its division of mental health and developmental disabilities. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all individuals admitted to nursing facilities were
    screened prior to admission as required by Public Act 89-21. Although an exact match of
    data was not available, there were nearly twice as many admissions to nursing homes in the
    12 month period of calendar year 1996 as there were screenings resulting in a nursing home
    placement during Fiscal Year 1997 (July 1, 1996 to June 30, 1997). The Department of
    Public Health has the authority to enforce this provision but had not taken steps to do
    so. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some weaknesses were identified in Aging's management controls
    over payments for screenings. We identified over $16,000 of duplicate bills submitted by
    one community agency that did screenings. After we identified these questionable billings,
    Aging notified the agency, the agency acknowledged the problem and returned the amount in
    error. Errors we identified at screening entities resulted in total recoveries of $19,896.
    Although the percentage of inappropriate bills was small, changes in the control system
    could help to guard against future errors or inappropriate bills. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few significant delays in providing service were noted in the
    first year of the universal screening program. One delay noted by a nursing home
    association was for Medicaid clients who were discharged from a hospital and clearly
    needed nursing home services. In a few cases, the screening was not conducted until
    several days after the patient had been admitted to a nursing home. When the screening is
    delayed, Public Aid rules require that payment cannot be made for services provided before
    the screening was performed. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data for the first half of Fiscal Year 1998 show that the
    number of screenings is comparable to Fiscal Year 1997 and the number of Community Care
    Program clients is also staying constant. If the number of people deflected to community
    care decreases, the continued cost effectiveness of the screening program may become
    questionable.</p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>BACKGROUND </b></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 23, 1996 the Illinois Senate adopted Senate Resolution
    Number 207 directing the Auditor General's Office to conduct a program audit of the
    universal screening program. The Resolution required that the audit commence on July 1,
    1997, and report to the General Assembly no later than June 30, 1998. The Resolution asked
    us to determine the cost effectiveness of the universal screening mandate including but
    not limited to: <ul>
      <li>Administrative Costs,</li>
      <li>Cost to the State,</li>
      <li>Operating Efficiency of the Program, and</li>

    <p><b>Aging does screenings for individuals age 60 or older<br>
    </b></td>
    <td valign="top" width="70%"><b><br>
    </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universal screening program is administered mainly by the
    Department on Aging (Aging) with assistance for certain screenings from two divisions of
    the Department of Human Services. These are the division of rehabilitation services and
    the division of mental health and developmental disabilities. The division of
    rehabilitation services conducts screenings for individuals 18 to 59 years of age. The
    division of mental health and developmental disabilities conducts screenings for
    individuals who are developmentally disabled or have mental illness, regardless of age.
    Aging is responsible for screening all individuals 60 years of age or older. The number of
    screenings performed by each of the three entities is shown in Digest Exhibit 1. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The mandate for universal screening is located in the Nursing Home Care Act (210 ILCS
    45/2-201.5). The Department of Public Health is responsible for administering the
    provisions of this licensing Act. All individuals seeking admission to a nursing facility
    licensed by Public Health under this Act must be screened to determine the need for
    nursing facility services prior to being admitted. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Department of Public Aid has been involved in
    development of the program because of the potential for impact on Medicaid long term care
    payments. Public Aid pays for nursing home care for people who are eligible for Medicaid.
    In addition, under a federal waiver, Medicaid money through Public Aid is used to pay for
    community care for individuals who qualify for Medicaid. The agencies involved with
    universal screening refer to the program as &quot;Choices for Care.&quot; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screening is an assessment of the need for long term care
    placement, regardless of payment source. The assessment evaluates the mental, physical,
    and economic status of the individual seeking nursing facility placement. The assessment
    used by Aging determines whether an individual needs nursing home care, and if they do,
    whether those needs could be met with home based services. (pages 3 to 4)</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Department on Aging</b></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universal screening program at Aging appears to have been
    cost effective during the first year. Even though only a small proportion of individuals
    screened were deflected from nursing facility care to less expensive community based care,
    we estimated that during Fiscal Year 1997, approximately $2.8 million was saved by the
    State with Aging's screenings. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first year of the universal screening mandate, Aging's
    Case Coordination Units (CCUs) conducted significantly more screenings than in the prior
    year. In Fiscal Year 1997, CCUs conducted and were reimbursed for 62,747 screenings on
    57,959 individuals. CCUs are local entities that Aging contracts with to do the
    screenings. In Fiscal Year 1996 there were 14,526 paid screenings. This change shows a 332
    percent increase in Fiscal Year 1997 over Fiscal Year 1996 screenings. Total reimbursed
    costs for Fiscal Year 1997 screenings were $3,602,054, an increase of $3,028,087 over the
    prior year's costs. </p>

    <td valign="top" width="70%"><b><br>
    </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 14,526 screenings conducted in Fiscal Year 1996 were for
    applicants to nursing facilities who sought to have Medicaid pay for their care.
    Therefore, most of the increase in Fiscal Year 1997 can be attributed to the new private
    pay/non-Medicaid population required to be screened as a result of the mandate. (pages 11
    to 14) <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few significant delays in providing services were noted
    in the first year of the universal screening program. One delay noted by a nursing home
    association was for Medicaid clients who were discharged from a hospital and clearly
    needed nursing home services. In a few cases, the screening was not conducted until
    several days after the patient was admitted to a nursing home. When the screening is
    delayed, Public Aid rules prohibit payment for nursing facility services provided before
    the screening has been performed. We recommended that Public Aid assure that screenings
    are completed before Medicaid payments are made to a nursing facility. (pages 27 to 28) </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We analyzed Aging's computer system and found that it lacked
    edit checks to adequately track, monitor, and control the universal screening program. In
    our analysis we identified over $16,000 of duplicate bills submitted by one community
    agency that did screenings. After we identified these questionable billings, Aging
    notified the agency, the agency acknowledged the problem and returned the amount in error.
    Errors we identified at this and other CCUs resulted in total recoveries of $19,896 during
    the audit. (pages 40 to 43) </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Department of Public Health</b></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Public Health has not established a control
    to assure that all individuals admitted to nursing facilities are screened to determine
    the need for nursing facility services prior to admission. Public Health, through the
    Nursing Home Care Act, is the agency responsible for licensing nursing facilities and
    assuring that the universal screening mandate is implemented (Nursing Home Care Act 210
    ILCS 45/1-109). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on data from Public Health, there were 99,820 admissions
    to nursing facilities in Calendar Year 1996. Based on Fiscal Year 1997 data from Aging and
    Human Services, there were a total of 58,065 screenings performed which resulted in
    nursing facility placement. Although Public Health data are not available for Fiscal Year
    1997 admissions, it is apparent that there are many individuals admitted to nursing
    facilities without the required screening. Because Aging focuses its efforts on people at
    risk, many of the missed admission screenings may be the people who are capable of
    remaining in the community with the assistance of State or private home care services. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Public Health already conducts site visits
    of nursing facilities and has rules that a nursing facility must follow to maintain its
    license. Although law and administrative rules have established that Aging and Human
    Services are responsible for doing the screenings, those agencies have little power to
    compel nursing facilities to assure screenings are done as required by the law. We
    recommended that Public Health take steps necessary to assure screenings are performed.
    (pages 37 to 39) </p>
    <p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Department of Human Services</b></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We concluded that the new universal screening mandate had
    minimal impact on the Department of Human Services. Human Services conducts two different
    types of screenings relating to the mandate. The screenings conducted by the mental health
    and developmental disabilities division are also required by federal law and would need to
    continue even without the mandate. The screenings of other individuals aged 18 to 59 are
    the responsibility of the division of rehabilitation services. However, because these
    screenings are performed by hospital discharge planners at no cost to the State or by
    Department employees who were already on staff, there were no additional costs to do the
    universal screening. Screenings performed by Human Services are discussed in greater
    detail in Chapter Two of this report. (pages 16 to 19) </p>
    <p><b>AGENCY RECOMMENDATIONS</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The audit report contains seven recommendations, five for the
    Department on Aging and one each for Public Aid and Public Health which have been
    mentioned in this Digest. We recommend that Aging:<ul>
      <li>Monitor the screenings done by Case Coordination Units and consider limiting multiple
        screenings in a short period of time. (page 26)</li>
      <li>Monitor the screening process to assure that biases are not reducing the cost
        effectiveness of the screening program. (page 31)</li>
      <li>Consider options to assure that private pay individuals can get appropriate home care
        services and consider options to further educate individuals to accept services offered.
        (page 34)</li>
      <li>Continue efforts to examine potential conflicts of interest of Case Coordination Units.
        (page 40)</li>
      <li>Make modifications to their computer system to correct problems identified in the audit.
        (page 43)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The agencies generally concurred with the recommendations.
    Agency responses to individual findings have been incorporated in the report and the
    complete responses are included as Appendix G of the audit report.</p>
