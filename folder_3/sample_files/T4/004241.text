CURRENTLY...LOW TEMPERATURE FOR ALAMOSA...SO FAR...HAS BEEN -29F AND            
THAT IS A NEW RECORD FOR 12/29. THE OLD RECORD WAS -28F/1966.  THERE            
IS STILL PLENTY OF CHANCES FOR THE ALAMOSA TEMPERATURE TO DROP

TODAY...WESTERLY CHINOOK FLOW WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE CENTRAL

WARMER TEMPERATURES...EXCEPT IN THE SAN LUIS VALLEY CENTER FLOOR                
WHERE THE TRAPPED COLD AIR/STRONG INVERSION/LOW SUN ANGLE SHOULD                
MAINTAIN SLOWLY RISING TEMPERATURES AND MAYBE GETTING INTO THE TEENS            
FOR ALAMOSA. WENT BELOW MOS GUIDANCE...ESPECIALLY MET MOS...FOR ALS

GENERATE SOME SNOWFALL ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST/CENTRAL MOUNTAINS AROUND

NORTHWESTERLY AS THE 100-120KT UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK MOVES OVER

LAYER DOES DEVELOP FOR PIKES PEAK/RAMPART RANGE AND MAYBE THE                   
WET/SANGRE DE CRISTO MOUNTAINS AFTER 05Z/30. 12KM NAM DOES HAVE SOME            
REVERSE SHEAR ALONG THE EAST SLOPES OF PIKES PEAK AND THE RAMPART               
RANGE...BUT THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE MUCH OF A PRESSURE JUMP IN              
THE 12KM NAM DATA. TOUGH CALL. ALSO...THE VERTICAL SHEAR TRANSITIONS            
FROM REVERSE TO STRONG FORWARD SHEAR TOWARDS SUN MORNING. COULD SEE             
SOME WIND GUSTS OF 70-80 MPH ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPES OF PIKES PEAK             
AND 55-65 MPH ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPES OF RAMPART RANGE AFTER 05Z/30            
AND ESPECIALLY JUST BEFORE SUNRISE SUN. ACROSS EL PASO COUNTY...IT              
WOULD MAINLY BE ALONG AND WEST OF I-25...WHERE EAST OF I-25 THE WIND            
WOULD BE RELATIVELY LIGHT. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL...WILL START A HIGH              
WIND WATCH(HW.A) FOR TELLER AND EL PASO COUNTIES LATER TONIGHT AND              
IT WILL CONTINUE INTO THE LONG TERM FORECAST. HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY/               
CATEGORICAL POPS WILL BE FOUND ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST/CENTRAL                     
MOUNTAINS ALONG THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE. FOR AN 18 HOUR                          
PERIOD...THERE COULD BE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF 1-6 INCHES FOR MAINLY             
THE HIGHER TERRAIN ABOVE 9K FT MSL. ALSO...BLOWING SNOW COULD BE A              
PROBLEM FOR THOSE AREAS... ESPECIALLY HIGH MOUNTAIN PASSES. WILL                
HOLD OFF ISSUING ANY SNOW/BLOWING SNOW ADVISORIES FOR THOSE AREAS               
AND HIT IT IN THE DIGITAL FORECAST DATABASE. THE OTHER CRITICAL                 
WEATHER AREA WOULD BE EXTREMELY COLD TEMPERATURES IN THE SAN LUIS               
VALLEY CENTER FLOOR AROUND ALAMOSA. WILL GO A FEW CATEGORIES BELOW              
MOS GUIDANCE. THERE COULD...ALSO...BE DRASTIC TEMPERATURE CHANGES               
ALONG AND WEST OF I-25 CORRIDOR GIVEN THE WINDY AND NON-WINDY AREAS.            
METZE

(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)                                                         
MAIN CHALLENGE FOR SUNDAY WILL BE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING WINDS                  
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT EASTERN SLOPES...AND SNOW                     
AMOUNTS FOR THE CENTRAL MOUNTAINS SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT.                   
JET STREAM SAGS SOUTHWARD OVER THE AREA ON SUNDAY AS NEXT SHORTWAVE             
BEGINS TO CARVE OUT THE TROF ACROSS THE NORTHERN US ROCKIES.                    
INITIALLY CROSS-SECTIONS AND MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW A POSSIBLE                    
MOUNTAIN WAVE SET UP...WITH MTN TOP STABLE LAYER WITH MTN TOP WINDS             
OF 50-55 KTS...AND SOME REVERSE SHEAR ALOFT.  MTN TOP STABLE LAYER              
IS NOT ALL THAT STRONG...WHICH LEADS TO SOME UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW              
MUCH WIND WILL GET DEFLECTED DOWNWARD...BUT PER COORDINATION WITH               
BOU WILL ISSUE A HIGH WIND WATCH.  INITIALLY NORTHWEST COMPONENT                
WILL FAVOR THE RAMPART RANGE AREA...AND PORTIONS OF WESTERN EL PASO             
COUNTY. AS UPPER JET MOVES IN ALOFT DURING THE                                  
AFTERNOON...INCREASING FORWARD SHEAR SHOULD DIMINISH HIGH WIND                  
POTENTIAL. HOWEVER...BY THEN WINDS AT ALL MTN TOP LEVELS WILL BE                
NEARING SUSTAINED HIGH WIND CRITERIA OF 50 MPH. IN FACT BY                      
AFTERNOON MTN TOP WINDS IN THE NAM12 INCREASE TO 60-70 KTS SO MTN               
TOP WINDS WILL BE VERY WINDY TO SAY THE LEAST. THUS...WILL INCLUDE              
THE HIGHER PEAKS OF THE SANGRES AND WET MOUNTAINS IN THE HIGH WIND              
WATCH AS WELL. WITH THE MAIN ENERGY STILL TO OUR WEST...LEE TROF                
STAYS PINNED UP ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE SE MTS...SO STRONG              
GUSTY WINDS WILL MAINLY STAY CONFINED TO AREAS ALONG/WEST OF                    
INTERSTATE 25. ANYWHERE WHERE THE WINDS PICK UP OVER OLD SNOW COVER...BLOWING   
SNOW COULD BE AN ISSUE...ESPECIALLY OVER THE MOUNTAIN PASSES...AND              
ALONG I-25 OVER MONUMENT HILL. LIGHT SNOW IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE               
ON SUNDAY...THEN RAMP UP SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AS THE NEXT                 
SHORTWAVE TROF/UPPER JET MOVES ACROSS THE STATE. CENTRAL MOUNTAINS              
MAY PICK UP ANOTHER 2-6 INCHES OF SNOWFALL FROM SUN AFTERNOON                   
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE SAWATCH AND                  
MOSQUITO RANGES MAY ALSO SEE WINDS NEARING HIGH WIND CRITERIA WITH              
SUSTAINED VALUES NEARING 50 MPH. HAVE DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE THEM               
IN THE HIGH WIND WATCH...AS THIS COULD BE ADDRESSED IN A SNOW AND               
BLOWING SNOW ADVISORY. LATER SHIFTS WILL MONITOR THIS POTENTIAL.                
AS TROF MOVES ACROSS SUNDAY NIGHT...VERY COLD AIR WILL SPILL                    
SOUTHEASTWARD BEHIND THE COLD FRONT.  COULD SEE SOME JET INDUCED                
SNOW BANDS ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHEAST PLAINS SUNDAY             
NIGHT.  GFS IS STILL DEPICTING THIS SCENARIO...WHILE NAM12 SUGGESTS             
IT WILL BE TOO DRY.  SINCE NAM SEEMS TO HAVE A RATHER DRY BIAS                  
LATELY...WILL GO CLOSER TO THE GFS SOLUTION AND KEEP SOME LOW GRADE             
POPS ACROSS ALL OF THE SOUTHEAST.  MONDAY WILL BE COLD THOUGH SOME              
GUSTY WINDS MAY HELP TEMPS RISE TO NEAR 30 ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SE            
PLAINS.  MTS WILL SEE TEMPS TOP OUT ONLY IN THE SINGLE DIGITS AND               
TEENS.

MUCH WIND WILL GET DEFLECTED DOWNWARD...BUT PER COORDINATION WITH               
BOU WILL ISSUE A HIGH WIND WATCH.  INITIALLY NORTHWEST COMPONENT                
WILL FAVOR THE RAMPART RANGE AREA...AND PORTIONS OF WESTERN EL PASO             
COUNTY. AS UPPER JET MOVES IN ALOFT DURING THE                                  
AFTERNOON...INCREASING FORWARD SHEAR SHOULD DIMINISH HIGH WIND                  
POTENTIAL. HOWEVER...BY THEN WINDS AT ALL MTN TOP LEVELS WILL BE                
NEARING SUSTAINED HIGH WIND CRITERIA OF 50 MPH. IN FACT BY                      
AFTERNOON MTN TOP WINDS IN THE NAM12 INCREASE TO 60-70 KTS SO MTN               
TOP WINDS WILL BE VERY WINDY TO SAY THE LEAST. THUS...WILL INCLUDE              
THE HIGHER PEAKS OF THE SANGRES AND WET MOUNTAINS IN THE HIGH WIND              
WATCH AS WELL. WITH THE MAIN ENERGY STILL TO OUR WEST...LEE TROF                
STAYS PINNED UP ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE SE MTS...SO STRONG              
GUSTY WINDS WILL MAINLY STAY CONFINED TO AREAS ALONG/WEST OF                    
INTERSTATE 25. ANYWHERE WHERE THE WINDS PICK UP OVER OLD SNOW COVER...BLOWING   
SNOW COULD BE AN ISSUE...ESPECIALLY OVER THE MOUNTAIN PASSES...AND              
ALONG I-25 OVER MONUMENT HILL. LIGHT SNOW IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE               
ON SUNDAY...THEN RAMP UP SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AS THE NEXT                 
SHORTWAVE TROF/UPPER JET MOVES ACROSS THE STATE. CENTRAL MOUNTAINS              
MAY PICK UP ANOTHER 2-6 INCHES OF SNOWFALL FROM SUN AFTERNOON                   
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE SAWATCH AND                  
MOSQUITO RANGES MAY ALSO SEE WINDS NEARING HIGH WIND CRITERIA WITH              
SUSTAINED VALUES NEARING 50 MPH. HAVE DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE THEM               
IN THE HIGH WIND WATCH...AS THIS COULD BE ADDRESSED IN A SNOW AND               
BLOWING SNOW ADVISORY. LATER SHIFTS WILL MONITOR THIS POTENTIAL.                
AS TROF MOVES ACROSS SUNDAY NIGHT...VERY COLD AIR WILL SPILL                    
SOUTHEASTWARD BEHIND THE COLD FRONT.  COULD SEE SOME JET INDUCED                
SNOW BANDS ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHEAST PLAINS SUNDAY             
NIGHT.  GFS IS STILL DEPICTING THIS SCENARIO...WHILE NAM12 SUGGESTS             
IT WILL BE TOO DRY.  SINCE NAM SEEMS TO HAVE A RATHER DRY BIAS                  
LATELY...WILL GO CLOSER TO THE GFS SOLUTION AND KEEP SOME LOW GRADE             
POPS ACROSS ALL OF THE SOUTHEAST.  MONDAY WILL BE COLD THOUGH SOME              
GUSTY WINDS MAY HELP TEMPS RISE TO NEAR 30 ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SE            
PLAINS.  MTS WILL SEE TEMPS TOP OUT ONLY IN THE SINGLE DIGITS AND               
TEENS.

WED...THE TRAILING H5 TROUGH AXIS PASSES EAST. H8 FLOW IS WEAKLY                
CYCLONIC...SO MOST OF THE AREA SHOULD REMAIN DRY BUT WITH ABUNDANT              
INSTABILITY STRATOCU. EASTERN SECTIONS COULD SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS              
AS DEEPER MOISTURE WRAPS AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE DEPARTING LOW.             
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE COLD SIDE...DROPPING TO AROUND -12C TO              
-14C AT 925 MB IN THE AFTERNOON. IT MIGHT BE A DAY WHERE HIGHS OCCUR            
IN THE MORNING...PROBABLY REACHING ONLY 25-30. GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS            
WILL MAKE IT FEEL EVEN COLDER...WITH WIND CHILLS DROPPING TO AROUND             
ZERO LATE WED NIGHT IN NYC....AND -5 TO -10 IN SOME INLAND SPOTS.               
RIDGING AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT BEGINS TO BUILD IN ON THU. IT WILL             
BE MOSTLY SUNNY...BUT STILL COLDER THAN NORMAL. LOW LEVEL                       
THICKNESSES SUPPORT EVEN COLDER HIGH TEMPS THAN THOSE OF WED...

KICK IN FOR SAT/SUN WITH HIGHS IN THE 40S...PERHAPS NEARING 50 IN               
NYC METRO ON SUN. A WARM FRONT PASSING TO THE NORTH/WEST COULD BRING            
THICKENING HIGH/MID LEVEL CLOUDS SAT NIGHT AND SUN...BUT LOW LEVELS             
WILL REMAIN QUITE DRY...SO NO PRECIP EXPECTED. NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIP            
APPEARS TO BE LATE SUN NIGHT WITH THE APPROACH OF A COLD FRONT.

TERMINALS...02Z TO 03Z AT KISP...KBDR AND KGON. IFR/LIFR TO FOLLOW              
BETWEEN 03Z AND 06Z. LATEST ACARS SOUNDINGS ACROSS NYC INDICATE                 
THAT THE GFS IS VERIFYING BETTER THAN THE NAM. THE WARM NOSE IN                 
THE NAM IS ABOUT 2 DEGREES TOO HIGH AT 800 MB. THE RUC IS VERIFIES              
EVEN BETTER...BUT THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED SINCE IT USES ACARS

KSWF BUT MAY BRIEFLY MIX WITH -IP AT TIMES THROUGH 09Z. LOOKING                 
UPSTREAM...KMPO (AND KDXR) HAVE CHANGED TO FZRA OVER THE LAST                   
HOUR. THIS IS BOTHERSOME AND INDICATES THAT WARMER AIR IS MOVING                
IN ALOFT. RUC INDICATES ABOUT A 3 HOUR PERIOD OF A WARM NOSE AT                 
KSWF BETWEEN 04Z AND 07Z WHICH IS WHEN THERE COULD BE SOME IP                   
MIXING IN...BUT IF THE WARM LAYER IS LARGER THAN THE PROFILE                    
INDICATES WE COULD BE LOOKING AT PRECIP CHANGING TO FZRA. NOT                   
CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT THIS WILL OCCUR...SO HAVE NOT INCLUDED IN                 
THE TAF.                                                                        
KJFK...KLGA...KEWR...KTEB AND KISP SHOULD ALL REMAIN RAIN                       
FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE EVENT...BUT COULD CHANGE OVER TO -SN AT                 
THE END (BETWEEN 09Z AND 12Z).                                                  
SO ACCORDING TO THE RUC...THE REMAINING TERMINALS (KBDR...KGON                  
AND KHPN)...WHICH WERE THE TOUGH ONES SINCE THEY REMAIN THE                     
CLOSEST TO THE RAIN/SNOW LINE...ALL REMAIN -RA FOR MAJORITY OF THE              
EVENT AS WELL POSSIBLY CHANGING TO -SN AT THE END TOO.                          
E/NE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BACK TO THE N THEN NW AS THE COASTAL LOW              
PASSES TO THE SOUTH AND EAST LATE TONIGHT/EARLY MON MORNING.                    
PRECIP SHOULD TAPER OFF FROM SW TO NE BETWEEN 12Z AND 15Z AND IT

STRONG SCA FOR NOW...AND LET MID SHIFT DECIDE IF GALES WILL BE MORE             
PREVALENT. FLAGS COME DOWN FROM WEST TO EAST MON EVENING...ENDING ON            
ALL WATERS BY MIDNIGHT. TRANQUIL CONDITIONS THEN EXPECTED THROUGH               
MIDDAY TUE. ANOTHER SYSTEM WILL BRING AT LEAST SCA CONDITIONS WITH              
GALES POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN. DUE TO STRONGER CAA AND A STRONGER

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH MONDAY/...                                                  
ONCE AGAIN WE ARE DEALING WITH A DOUBLE BARREL STORM SYSTEM BASED ON            
THE LATEST 13KM RUC AND MSAS ANALYSIS. THIS TIME THE COASTAL LOW                
REALLY IS THE PRIMARY STORM SYSTEM CURRENTLY FORMING NEAR THE                   
DELMARVA REGION WITH A SECONDARY/INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE UPPER MID             
ATLANTIC REGION/PA.  IT WILL BE A FAST MOVING SYSTEM BASED ON THE               
FAST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT...AND THE MAIN SFC WAVE NEVER CLOSES              
OFF BASED ON THE MODEL GUIDANCE.                                                
THE RADAR TRENDS FROM THE KENX RADAR AND NEIGHBORING SITES HAS BEEN             
FOR THE ATMOSPHERE TO SATURATE AND COOL.  WE HAVE SEEN SUDDEN                   
EVAPORATIVE COOLING/WET BULBING AT KPOU AROUND 00Z...AND WE EVEN                
HAVE HAD A FEW FLAKES HERE AT CESTM...AND AT THE AIRPORT BETWEEN                
01Z-02Z.  THE MAIN SYNOPTIC FORCING WITH THIS INITIAL BURST OF SNOW             
WILL BE WITH THE INVERTED TROUGH WITH ITS ASSOCIATED ISENTROPIC                 
LIFT.  AROUND 06Z...THE H850-700 FRONTOGENETICAL FORCING WITH THE               
COASTAL LOW SHOULD PRODUCE A DECENT MESOSCALE SNOWBAND OVER THE                 
CAPITAL REGION...THE BERKSHIRES...SRN VT...AND THE CATSKILLS.  SNOW             
RATES MAY EXCEED AN INCH AN HOUR FOR A 3-HOUR STRETCH.  WE HAVE NOT             
CHANGED HEADLINES...BECAUSE THE MAX QPF FROM THE                                
PLUMES...ENSEMBLES...GFS...AND NAM PER THE 18Z GUIDANCE IS STILL                
AROUND A HALF AN INCH.  THIS EVENT WILL GO DOWN TO SNOW RATIOS.  IF             
IT IS AROUND 10:1...THEN THE CURRENT HEADLINES LOOK FINE.  WE ARE               
GOING TO STICK WITH THEM.  HIGHER SNOW RATIOS WOULD MAKE IT DICEY               
FOR THE CAPITAL REGION...AND TACONICS.  WE BELIEVE THE HIGHER                   
ELEVATIONS WILL SATURATE THE QUICKEST HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF                   
GETTING 7 OR MORE INCHES IN 12 HOURS.                                           
SOME SLEET SHOULD STILL MIX IN OVER THE MID HUDSON VALLEY...SOUTHERN            
TACONICS...AND LITCHFIELD HILLS WITH THERMAL PROFILES INDICATING                
ABOVE FREEZING AIR MOVING IN THE 850-700 LAYER THERE. KPOU AT 02Z IS            
NOW REPORTING UNKNOWN PCPN...WHICH IS LIKELY SLEET.                             
THEREFORE...KEEPING A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY LOOKS GOOD.                       
THE SNOW SHOULD END QUICKLY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH BETWEEN                         
12Z-16Z...WITH THE SNOW LINGERING WITH THE H850-700 DEFORMATION AXIS            
FROM ALY NORTH AND WEST TO THE CYCLONE.                                         
WE WILL RETOOLING POPS AND TEMPS IN THE GRIDS A BIT AND KEEP THE                
SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS INTACT WITH 5-10 INCHES OVER THE ERN                     
CATSKILLS...BERKSHIRES...AND SRN VT.  EXPECT 3-8 INCHES EVERYWHERE              
ELSE IN THE ALY FCST AREA.

LOW PRESSURE WILL APPROACH FROM THE MID-ATLANTIC...PASSING SOUTH AND            
EAST OF LONG ISLAND DURING THE OVERNIGHT BEFORE DEPARTING BY EARLY              
MONDAY AFTERNOON. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE THEN QUICKLY PASSES TO THE                 
SOUTH OF THE AREA. A CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION ON              
TUESDAY...USHERING BITTERLY COLD AIR BEHIND IT AS CANADIAN HIGH                 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION. DRY WEATHER IS THEN EXPECTED INTO              
THE WEEKEND.

MODELS COMING INTO FAIR AGREEMENT REGARDING THE STORM SYSTEM                    
CURRENTLY STRENGTHENING OVER THE SOUTHEAST. THE LOW WILL FIND ITSELF            
JUST OVER THE DELMARVA AREA BY 00Z...RAPIDLY DEEPENING FROM ABOUT               
1010 MB TO 1003 MB AS IT MOVES NORTHEAST TO A POINT ABOUT 100 MILES             
SOUTH AND EAST OF KMTP TOWARDS DAYBREAK.                                        
MAIN ISSUE IS GOING TO BE PTYPE. BASED ON NAM AND GFS BUFKIT                    
SOUNDINGS...LOOKS LIKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF WARM AIR WILL OVERSPREAD THE            
MIDDLE LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE ACROSS THE REGION...MAINLY KEEPING              
PRECIP IN THE FORM OF RAIN FOR SOUTHERN LOCATIONS...MIXING WITH                 
SLEET AFTER MIDNIGHT. FURTHER TO THE NORTH...PTYPE MAY START OUT AS             
A PERIOD OF RAIN BEFORE MIXING WITH AND CHANGING TO SNOW THIS                   
EVENING. WILL ALSO SEE SLEET MIXING WITH THE SNOW DURING THE                    
OVERNIGHT. THESE SIGNATURES WERE INDICATED ON BOTH NAM AND GFS                  
BUFKIT SOUNDINGS. CHANGES WERE NOT NEEDED FOR THE WINTER WEATHER                
ADVISORY...AS 3-5" OF SNOW/SLEET WILL FALL ACROSS INTERIOR PORTIONS             
OF THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY AND INTERIOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CT.                
THERE MAY BE A THIN SWATH OF 1" TO MAYBE 2" ACROSS SOUTHERN PORTIONS            
OF THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY AND INTO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST              
NJ. NYC/LONG ISLAND AND IMMEDIATE COASTAL LOCALES ARE EXPECTED TO               
PICK UP LESS THAN AN INCH OF SLUSHY ACCUMULATION...AND MAINLY ON                
COLDER AND GRASSY SURFACES. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR NORTHERN AND                   
WESTERN PORTIONS OF ORANGE COUNTY. QPF WAS A BIT HIGHER THAN                    
PREVIOUSLY FCST. STILL THINK THERE WILL BE ENOUGH WARM AIR ALOFT TO             
CAP ACCUMULATIONS AT 5"...BUT NAM/GFS BUFKIT DATA DID INDICATE THAT             
UP TO 6" OF SNOW COULD ACCUMULATE. EVENING SHIFT WILL HAVE TO                   
MONITOR TO DETERMINE IF A WARNING IS NEEDED IF MORE THAN 6" WOULD               
ACCUMULATE. IT/S CLOSE...BUT WILL HOLD AT A WINTER WEATHER                      
ADVISORY WITH THIS PACKAGE.                                                     
TOWARDS DAYBREAK...AS THE LOW MOVES TOWARDS THE GULF OF MAINE...                
NORTHWEST WINDS WILL PICK UP ACROSS THE AREA. ENOUGH COLD AIR WILL              
MIX DOWN TO THE AREA TO TURN PRECIP OVER TO SNOW BEFORE ENDING.                 
WITH 1/2" TO 3/4" QPF EXPECTED...WILL HAVE TO ALSO MONITOR FOR ANY              
LOCALIZED URBAN FLOODING PROBLEMS WHERE PRECIP REMAINS MAINLY RAIN              
THROUGH A GOOD PORTION OF THE NIGHT.                                            
USED A BLEND OF MAV/MET/FWC MOS GUIDANCE TO GET LOWS IN THE LOW-MID             
30S ACROSS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA AND UPPER 20S ACROSS THE                
INTERIOR.

.SHORT TERM /6 AM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...                      
PRECIP WILL WIND DOWN AS A PERIOD OF SNOW BEFORE TAPERING OFF WITH              
MINOR ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS. SKIES CLEAR OUT DURING THE AFTERNOON            
AS HIGH PRES MOVES INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC BY MIDDAY...THEN OFFSHORE              
MON NIGHT. A CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION ON TUE...               
MOVING OFFSHORE BY TUE NIGHT. WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY LIKELY                     
POPS...AS THERE WEREN/T ANY MAJOR CHANGES THAT WERE NEEDED TO BE                
MADE TO THE PREVIOUS FCST. MODELS SEEM TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON                 
THIS UPCOMING SYSTEM. TEMPS WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT SNOW                 
THE THE NORTH...AND WARM ENOUGH FOR RAIN TO THE SOUTH. PRECIP WILL              
TAPER OFF AS ALL SNOW TUE NIGHT. WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES MAY                  
HAVE TO BE POSTED FOR ORANGE/PUTNAM/NORTHERN FAIRFIELD COUNTIES                 
FOR TUE...AS OVER 3" SNOW COULD ACCUMULATE...BUT WILL WAIT FOR

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...                                        
AS THE STORM HEADS OUT FARTHER INTO THE CANADIAN MARITIMES ON                   
WED...THE TRAILING H5 TROUGH AXIS PASSES EAST. H8 FLOW IS WEAKLY                
CYCLONIC...SO MOST OF THE AREA SHOULD REMAIN DRY BUT WITH ABUNDANT              
INSTABILITY STRATOCU. EASTERN SECTIONS COULD SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS              
AS DEEPER MOISTURE WRAPS AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE DEPARTING LOW.             
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE COLD SIDE...DROPPING TO AROUND -12C TO              
-14C AT 925 MB IN THE AFTERNOON. IT MIGHT BE A DAY WHERE HIGHS OCCUR            
IN THE MORNING...PROBABLY REACHING ONLY 25-30. GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS            
WILL MAKE IT FEEL EVEN COLDER...WITH WIND CHILLS DROPPING TO AROUND             
ZERO LATE WED NIGHT IN NYC....AND -5 TO -10 IN SOME INLAND SPOTS.               
RIDGING AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT BEGINS TO BUILD IN ON THU. IT WILL             
BE MOSTLY SUNNY...BUT STILL COLDER THAN NORMAL. LOW LEVEL                       
THICKNESSES SUPPORT EVEN COLDER HIGH TEMPS THAN THOSE OF WED...                 
REMAINING IN THE 20S THROUGHOUT.                                                
THE CENTER OF THE HIGH WILL MOVE OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST ON                  
FRI...WITH A DEVELOPING RETURN FLOW. MODERATION WILL BE SLOWER THAN             
MOS SUGGESTS ON FRI...WITH HIGHS IN THE 30S THROUGHOUT...BUT SHOULD             
KICK IN FOR SAT/SUN WITH HIGHS IN THE 40S...PERHAPS NEARING 50 IN               
NYC METRO ON SUN. A WARM FRONT PASSING TO THE NORTH/WEST COULD BRING            
THICKENING HIGH/MID LEVEL CLOUDS SAT NIGHT AND SUN...BUT LOW LEVELS             
WILL REMAIN QUITE DRY...SO NO PRECIP EXPECTED. NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIP            
APPEARS TO BE LATE SUN NIGHT WITH THE APPROACH OF A COLD FRONT.                 
TEMPS SHOULD RUN AT LEAST SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER THAN MOS WITH                  
SOUTHERLY FLOW AND CLOUD COVER...MAKING FOR AN ALL RAIN EVENT                   
SUN NIGHT.

.AVIATION /00Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...                                        
CONDITIONS SHOULD DROP TO MVFR BY 01Z OR 02Z ACROSS WESTERN                     
TERMINALS...02Z TO 03Z AT KISP...KBDR AND KGON. IFR/LIFR TO FOLLOW              
BETWEEN 03Z AND 06Z. LATEST ACARS SOUNDINGS ACROSS NYC INDICATE                 
THAT THE GFS IS VERIFYING BETTER THAN THE NAM. THE WARM NOSE IN                 
THE NAM IS ABOUT 2 DEGREES TOO HIGH AT 800 MB. THE RUC IS VERIFIES              
EVEN BETTER...BUT THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED SINCE IT USES ACARS                    
SOUNDINGS IN IT.                                                                
-SN IS EXPECTED TO BE THE DOMINANT P-TYPE AT                                    
KSWF BUT MAY BRIEFLY MIX WITH -IP AT TIMES THROUGH 09Z. LOOKING                 
UPSTREAM...KMPO (AND KDXR) HAVE CHANGED TO FZRA OVER THE LAST                   
HOUR. THIS IS BOTHERSOME AND INDICATES THAT WARMER AIR IS MOVING                
IN ALOFT. RUC INDICATES ABOUT A 3 HOUR PERIOD OF A WARM NOSE AT                 
KSWF BETWEEN 04Z AND 07Z WHICH IS WHEN THERE COULD BE SOME IP                   
MIXING IN...BUT IF THE WARM LAYER IS LARGER THAN THE PROFILE                    
INDICATES WE COULD BE LOOKING AT PRECIP CHANGING TO FZRA. NOT                   
CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT THIS WILL OCCUR...SO HAVE NOT INCLUDED IN                 
THE TAF.                                                                        
KJFK...KLGA...KEWR...KTEB AND KISP SHOULD ALL REMAIN RAIN                       
FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE EVENT...BUT COULD CHANGE OVER TO -SN AT                 
THE END (BETWEEN 09Z AND 12Z).                                                  
SO ACCORDING TO THE RUC...THE REMAINING TERMINALS (KBDR...KGON                  
AND KHPN)...WHICH WERE THE TOUGH ONES SINCE THEY REMAIN THE                     
CLOSEST TO THE RAIN/SNOW LINE...ALL REMAIN -RA FOR MAJORITY OF THE              
EVENT AS WELL POSSIBLY CHANGING TO -SN AT THE END TOO.                          
E/NE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BACK TO THE N THEN NW AS THE COASTAL LOW              
PASSES TO THE SOUTH AND EAST LATE TONIGHT/EARLY MON MORNING.                    
PRECIP SHOULD TAPER OFF FROM SW TO NE BETWEEN 12Z AND 15Z AND IT                
MAY NEED TO BE EXTENDED AN HOUR OR TWO LONGER THAN WHAT IS IN THE               
00Z TAFS...BUT WILL WATCH RADAR AND ADJUST ACCORDINGLY.                         
VFR CONDITIONS RETURN TO ALL TERMINALS BETWEEN 14Z AND 16Z WITH                 
ONLY GUSTY NW WINDS TO CONTEND WITH. SUSTAINED WINDS SHOULD RANGE               
BETWEEN 12 AND 17KT WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 25 AND 30 KT.                            
OUTLOOK FOR 00Z TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...VFR REMAINS THROUGH                  
MONDAY NIGHT. SUB-VFR CONDITIONS ARE AGAIN LIKELY TUESDAY AND                   
TUESDAY EVENING AS AN ALBERTA CLIPPER LOW AND COLD FRONT PASS                   
ACROSS THE AREA. RAIN NEAR THE COAST...RAIN/SNOW INTERIOR. THIS                 
WILL BE FOLLOWED BY GUSTY W-NW FLOW LATER TUE NIGHT THROUGH THU AS              
THE OFFSHORE LOW INTENSIFIES AND DRAWS DOWN ARCTIC AIR. LIGHT SNOW              
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES WILL BE POSSIBLE ON WEDNESDAY...OTHERWISE DRY.              
&&

TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...                                                  
SCA WILL BE UP FOR ALL WATERS STARTING THIS EVENING AS WIND GUSTS               
WILL BE OVER 25 KT...AND WAVES WILL BUILD TO 4-6 FT ON THE OCEAN.               
AFTER THE LOW DEPARTS ON MON...WEAK HIGH PRES WILL BUILD TO THE                 
SOUTH. WITH A SHOT OF CAA...AND A TIGHT GRADIENT ON THE WATERS...               
THERE COULD BE OCNL GALE FORCE GUSTS DURING MON AFTERNOON. WILL                 
CARRY STRONGLY WORDED SCA FOR NOW...AND LET MID SHIFT DECIDE IF                 
GALES WILL BE MORE PREVALENT. THINK A GALE EVENT WILL BE MARGINAL               
AT BEST. FLAGS COME DOWN FROM WEST TO EAST MON EVENING...ENDING ON              
ALL WATERS BY MIDNIGHT. TRANQUIL CONDITIONS THEN EXPECTED THROUGH               
MIDDAY TUE. ANOTHER SYSTEM WILL BRING AT LEAST SCA CONDITIONS WITH              
GALES POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN. DUE TO STRONGER CAA AND A STRONGER                   
GRADIENT...THINK THERE WILL BE A BETTER CHANCE FOR GALES LATE TUE               
THAN LATE MON.                                                                  
WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...                                               
A STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT AND LOW LEVEL CAA/INSTABILITY WILL                   
COMBINE TO PRODUCE NW GALES ON THE OCEAN WED THROUGH THU                        
MORNING...AND SCA CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE. SCA CONDITIONS ON THE                   
OCEAN SHOULD COME TO AN END LATE THU NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS              
OVER THE WATERS...BUT COULD RETURN TO THE EASTERN OCEAN WATERS FRI              
NIGHT VIA A STRENGTHENING WSW FLOW AS THE CORE OF THE HIGH PASSES

COASTAL PLAIN BY 3 AM LOOKS REASONABLE...DESPITE PLENTY OF DRY AIR TO           
OVERCOME AT MID LEVELS PER 00Z SOUNDINGS. 00Z NAM TIMING IS A BIT               
BETTER BUT PROBABLY STILL A LITTLE SLOW.

DESPITE FAIRLY THICK CLOUD COVER...WITH MANY LOCATIONS IN UPPER 20S

WARM ADVECTION GETS UNDERWAY AT AT LEVELS...BUT SOME OF SHELTERED               
AND DEEPER VALLEYS WILL BE LAST TO WARM UP. WE USED 18Z NAM PARTIAL             
THICKNESSES WHICH BETTER REFLECT THIS LOW LEVEL COLD BUT OVERALL                
RESULT IS SIMILAR TO AFTERNOON FORECAST...IF ANYTHING A LITTLE LESS             
SNOWFALL WHICH IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY LATEST SREFS AND MODEL FORECAST

WE THINK MOST AREAS NORTH OF I-90 WILL START OUT AS A SNOW/SLEET MIX            
AND QUICKLY TRANSITION TO SLEET/FREEZING RAIN. CORRIDOR BETWEEN I-90

WHILE IT PROBABLY TAKES UNTIL SUNRISE SAT FOR OUR SW NH ZONES TO WARM           
UP ENOUGH FOR A CHANGE TO RAIN. THIS MEANS WE EXPECT AN INCH OR TWO             
OF SNOWFALL AT MOST IN FAR SW NH WITH A LIGHT COATING /0.10/ OF ICE.            
WE DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE MUCH IF ANY ICING ACROSS NORTHERN

OPERATIONAL GFS/UKMET/CANADIAN GGEM AND THE UKMET ALL COMING INTO               
BETTER AGREEMENT REGARDING INCREASED CHANCES FOR ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL          
ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. RECENT           
OPERATIONAL TRENDS BRING THE SURFACE LOW TRACK CLOSER TO THE COAST.             
HOWEVER THERE IS STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING OF           
PRECIPITATION AS WELL ACTUAL LOW TRACK. THE 12Z NAM AND 09Z SREF RUNS           
WERE TRACKING A WEAKER LOW TO THE SOUTH OF THE REGION. IN ADDITION              
THE GFS ENSEMBLES INDICATED 4 OF ITS 12 MEMBERS FAVORING THIS                   
SCENARIO. OVERALL THE LOW TRACK AND INTENSIFICATION WILL DEPEND ON              
THE STRENGTH AND TIMING OF A PACIFIC JET STREAK WHICH WILL ATTEMPT TO           
INTERSECT WITH A SECOND JET STREAK ENTERING THE NORTHEAST ALLOWING              
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE TO INTENSIFY. IN ADDITION SIGNIFICANT GULF AND             
ATLANTIC MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE.                                            
GIVEN SOME UNCERTAINTY AMONGST MODEL RUNS DECIDED USE A MODEL BLEND             
SIMILAR TO HPC. OVERALL DECIDED RAISE POPS TO LIKELY GIVEN RECENT               
TRENDS AND DECENT CONSENSUS AMONGST MOST OF THE OPERATIONAL MODEL               
GUIDANCE AND ENSEMBLES. CURRENT THERMAL PROFILES FAVOR MOSTLY                   
SNOW...BUT SOME RAIN AND SLEET COULD MIX IN ACROSS THE CAPE AND                 
ISLANDS GIVEN SOME STRENGTHENING ONSHORE FLOW AND WARM AIR ADVECTION.

WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. STRONG OMEGA AND MID LEVEL FRONTOGENETIC              
FORCING WITHIN THE LOWS DEFORMATION ZONE COULD YIELD A BAND OF                  
LOCALLY HEAVY SNOWFALL WITHIN THE FORECAST AREA. WILL HIGHLIGHT THE

MAIN TIMEFRAME OF CONCERN WILL BE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AS

NOT FALL MUCH BELOW CLIMO NORMS WITH UPPER 30S TO NEAR 40 NORTH TO              
MIDDLE 40S SOUTH. HOWEVER...LOW TEMPS TUESDAY MORNING WILL HIGHLY               
DEPEND ON THE EXACT FRONTAL TIMING...AS EVEN A FEW HOURS WILL MAKE A

ADVECTION WILL REALLY BEING TO BE FELT ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY                  
EVENING WITH TEMPERATURES FALLING RAPIDLY THROUGH THE 40S AND 30S.              
GOOD CHANCE FOR A WIDESPREAD FREEZE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY                    
WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH MIDDLE AND UPPER 20S COMMON. CURRENT GRIDS

OF HARD FREEZE CRITERIA. BUMPED TEMPS UP A FEW DEGREES SINCE THE MAV            
HAS HAD A COOL BIAS SO FAR THIS WINTER SEASON WITH ITS LOWS.

STRONG CAA PATTERN CONTINUES WEDNESDAY AS SHARP UPPER TROUGH DIGS               
INTO THE DEEP SOUTH AND 1045+MB HIGH PRESSURE DROPS INTO THE CENTRAL            
PLAINS. FREEZING TEMPS EXPECTED BY WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH HARD                  
FREEZE POSSIBLE OVER SOUTH GEORGIA. TEMPS WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH 50             
DEGREES WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON LEADING INTO THE COLDEST NIGHT OF THE               
SEASON SO FAR. SFC HIGH WILL BE LOCATED NORTH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY             
NIGHT...NOT THE IDEAL POSITION FOR RADIATIONAL COOLING...BUT THE                
GRADIENT SHOULD RELAX ENOUGH TO ALLOW TEMPS TO PLUMMET IN THE COLD              
AND DRY AIRMASS. GUIDANCE STILL CALLING FOR HARD FREEZE FOR ALL BUT             
THE IMMEDIATE COAST BY THURSDAY MORNING. THEREAFTER...AIRMASS WILL              
GRADUALLY MODIFY AS SFC HIGH PARKS OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND                
UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL. MAY SEE A LIGHT FREEZE AGAIN FRIDAY              
MORNING BEFORE EASTERLY FLOW MOISTENS THINGS UP AND WARMS TEMPS UP.             
EASTERLY FLOW THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND WILL MOISTEN UP THE LOW

.SYNOPSIS...                                                                    
19Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RUC ANALYSIS SHOWING MOST OF THE CONUS UNDER             
THE INFLUENCE OF A LONG WAVE TROUGH WITH AN AXIS FROM THE NORTHERN              
PLAINS TO WEST TEXAS. THIS TROUGH HAS TAPPED INTO THE SOUTHERN                  
STREAM WITH PLENTY OF MID/HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE PUMPING UP ON THE                 
EASTERN SIDE FROM THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO TO THE SOUTHEASTERN                
STATES.                                                                         
AT THE SURFACE...NEARLY STATIONARY BOUNDARY IS ANALYZED FROM THE                
WESTERN FL PANHANDLE SOMEWHERE AROUND SE AL/SW GEORGIA AND THEN                 
CONTINUING NORTHEAST. THIS BOUNDARY HAS BEEN THE FOCUS FOR NUMEROUS             
SHOWERS AND EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS TODAY ACROSS THE NORTHWEST HALF              
OF THE FORECAST AREA. FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST THE SHOWERS HAVE BEEN              
ISOLATED IN NATURE WITH FOG BEING THE BIGGER CONCERN. BREAKS OF SUN             
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP IN THE LOW CLOUDS WITH MUCH OF THE FOG                
LIFTING THIS EARLY AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...WITH THE SETTING OF THE                 
SUN...THE FOG IS VERY LIKELY TO RETURN.                                         
FOR THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON...EXPECT THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE             
FORECAST AREA TO CONTINUE TO SEE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED                 
THUNDERSTORMS. FROM KAAF...TO KTLH...TO KVLD SOUTH AND EAST THE                 
SHOWERS WILL BE VERY ISOLATED IN NATURE AND SHOULD GENERALLY REMAIN             
DRY INTO THE EVENING HOURS.                                                     
&&                                                                              
.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.                                     
MAIN UPPER TROUGH AXIS BEGINS TO SHIFT EASTWARD OVERNIGHT FROM THE              
SOUTHERN PLAINS WITH A  PIECE OF ENERGY ROUNDING THE BASE INTO THE              
CENTRAL GULF COAST LATE. DEEP LAYER Q-G FORCING ON THE EASTERN SIDE             
OF THE TROUGH WILL COMBINE WITH UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE RIGHT REAR              
QUADRANT OF A 150-170KT UPPER JET TO PRODUCE PLENTY OF SYNOPTIC                 
FORCING (ESPECIALLY LATE TONIGHT AND DURING SUNDAY MORNING). ALSO               
GFS/NAM SHOWING AN INCREASINGLY STRONG 850MB JET (45-55KT) OVER THE             
WESTERN PANHANDLE...SOUTHEAST AL/SOUTHWEST GA DURING THE SECOND HALF            
OF THE NIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING. THIS JET WILL ACT TO ENHANCE THE                   
THETA-E RIDGE. STRONG POSITIVE THETA-E ADVECTION IS EXPECTED TO THE             
NORTH OF THE SURFACE BOUNDARY THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF                         
SUNDAY...THIS COMBINED WITH THE SYNOPTIC FORCING DESCRIBED ABOVE                
SHOULD RESULT IN AN AREA OF WIDESPREAD SHOWERS/STORMS FROM KMOB TO              
PORTIONS OF SE AL AND AREAS GENERALLY NORTH AND WEST OF A LINE FROM             
KDHN TO KABY. THERE WILL BE THE POTENTIAL WITH THIS SETUP FOR SOME              
LOCALLY VERY HEAVY RAINFALL...WITH BACKBUILDING AND TRAINING CELLS.             
IN ADDITION TO HEAVY RAINFALL THREAT...40+ KNOTS OF 0-6KM BULK SHEAR            
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A FEW ORGANIZED CELLS. THESE                    
ORGANIZED CELLS COMBINED WITH STEEPENING MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATES AS A             
RESULT OF THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE MAY RESULT IN A FEW STRONGER                
STORMS INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON. NOT EXPECTING A WIDESPREAD SEVERE              
WX OUTBREAK...BUT JUST THE POTENTIAL FOR A FEW LOCALIZED DAMAGING               
WIND GUSTS OR MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL.                                           
EASTWARD MOTION OF THE TROUGH SHOULD HELP TO FINALLY BEGIN PUSHING              
THE SURFACE BOUNDARY EASTWARD DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING.                 
LARGE SCALE FORCING WILL BE EXITING TO THE NORTHEAST BY THE MIDDLE              
TO LATER AFTERNOON HOURS RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF AREAL COVERAGE             
AND RAINFALL INTENSITY. HOWEVER STILL EXPECT A BAND OF                          
SHOWERS/STORMS TO REACH THE SOUTHEASTERN HALF OF THE REGION DURING              
THE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING SUNDAY. GOING WITH SOME RATHER HIGH POPS            
FOR THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE REGION TONIGHT INTO THE FIRST HALF OF             
SUNDAY WITH WIDESPREAD 70-90%. DYNAMICS LOOK TO REMAIN OVER THESE               
AREAS FOR MUCH OF THE NIGHT AND WILL ONLY BE GOING WITH SLIGHT                  
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FROM KAAF TO KTLH AND KVLD SOUTH AND EAST. FOR            
THESE AREAS WHERE RAINFALL WILL BE LESS WIDESPREAD...EXPECTING TO               
ONCE AGAIN SEE AREAS OF DENSE FOG DEVELOP. THIS FOG WILL LIKELY                 
LINGER THROUGH A GOOD PORTION OF THE MORNING AND WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED            
IN THE AFTERNOON TAF PACKAGE. WILL SHIFT THE HIGHEST POPS EASTWARD              
FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS. MOST WIDESPREAD ACTIVITY DURING THE                    
AFTERNOON WILL BE ACROSS SOUTHWEST/SOUTH-CENTRAL GEORGIA...CLOSEST              
TO THE DEPARTING UPPER DYNAMICS.                                                
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVERHEAD FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AS LINGERING SHOWERS             
DEPART TO THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST DURING THE EVENING HOURS. BACK TO              
MORE SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES FOR MONDAY WITH FAIR WX FOR ALL.                   
BIG CHANGES THEN COMING FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...WILL BE                    
WATCHING A STRONG COLD FRONT APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST DURING                 
MONDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT SHOULD PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA EARLY            
TUESDAY WITH A MUCH COLDER AIRMASS TO FOLLOW. THIS AIRMASS WILL HAVE            
THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE COLDEST AIR THAT MANY OF US HAVE SEEN FOR               
THE SEASON THUSFAR.

TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. FOR MIDWEEK WITH NEARLY ZONAL FLOW                 
RETURNING BY LATE THURSDAY. A FEW NOTABLE CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO               
THE EXTENDED GRIDS. FIRST...WILL REMOVE THE SLIGHT POP FOR TUESDAY              
AS WE FEEL THE FRONT WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH MOISTURE TO WORK WITH TO              
PRODUCE ANY APPRECIABLE RAIN. SECOND...BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF                   
1000MB-500MB THICKNESS VALUES HAVE INCREASED ACROSS OUR REGION OVER             
PREVIOUS RUNS AND MEX MIN TEMPS HAVE BACKED OFF FROM THE UPPER TEENS            
TO THE LOWER TO UPPER 20S FOR THURSDAY MORNING. WILL BUMP TEMPS UP A            
FEW DEGREES BUT NOT AS MUCH AS GUIDANCE SUGGESTS (I.E. FROM 18                  
DEGREES TO 27 DEGREES AT TLH) TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF                       
FLIP-FLOPPING. OTHERWISE... AFTER THE BRIEF PERIOD OF COLD                      
TEMPS...WE WILL SEE A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WITH TEMPS RETURNING TO

STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY LYING JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST             
WATERS. FLOW IS EXPECTED TO REACH CAUTIONARY LEVELS TONIGHT AND MAY             
BRIEFLY APPROACH ADVISORY LEVELS LATE. COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY PUSH              
EAST ACROSS THE WATERS ON SUNDAY PASSING SOUTH AND EAST OF THE

WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS AND 850 TEMPERATURES WARMING SOME 4-9F                  
(COOLEST ACROSS THE NORTHWEST AND WEST WHERE DEEPEST SNOW PACK                  
EXISTS) WILL ALLOW FOR A BIT MORE MELTING ACROSS THE AREA AS                    
TEMPERATURES WARM INTO THE LOW 30S WEST AND NORTH WITH NEAR 40 AND              
SOME LOWER 40S ACROSS THE AREAS WHERE LITTLE OR NO SNOW PACK                    
EXISTS. THIS WARMING TREND WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS A 140+ KT 250                 
JET AND PACIFIC COLD FRONT MOVE INTO THE AREA DURING THE OVERNIGHT              
HOURS. LOW TEMPS WILL BE COLDEST ACROSS THE WEST...LESS COLD                    
ACROSS THE EAST. NORTHWEST WINDS IN THE 15-25/20-30 MPH RANGE WILL              
ALSO BE COMMON. AS FAR AS PRECIPITATION CHANCES...GFS STILL LOOKS               
OVERDONE WITH OVERALL MOISTURE PROFILES. NAM/NGM/RUC QUITE A BIT                
DRIER. IF THE GFS WERE TO VERIFY SOME LOW POPS MAY BE NEEDED FOR                
SOME LIGHT SHOWERS OR SILENT POPS FOR VIRGA AS THEY (NGM/NAM/GFS)               
SHOW SOME GOOD 700 FRONTOGENESIS WITHIN THE HIGHER 850-500                      
MOISTURE THAT THE GFS GENERATES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE                 
AREA. WILL BRIEF DAY SHIFT TO THIS BUT I DONT SEE ANYTHING                      
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.                                                            
FOR MONDAY 850 TEMPERATURES DROP ABOUT 15F ACROSS THE AREA WHICH                
ALONE WITH ONLY SUPPORT 20-25 ACROSS THE DEEPER SNOW PACK AREAS OF              
FAR EASTERN COLORADO AND SOUTHWEST NEBRASKA WITH 30 OR SO                       
ELSEWHERE. 21Z SREF TEMPS ALSO SIMILAR BUT THE MOS GUIDANCE SEEMS               
OUT TO LUNCH WHICH GIVEN THE SNOW PACK MAKES SENSE. ADD TO THAT                 
THE FACT THAT THE WIND WILL BE BLOWING FROM THE DEEPER SNOW PACK                
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE REST OF THE AREA...POSSIBLY FURTHER IMPACTING              
THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST. SPEAKING OF WINDS...ANOTHER TOUGH                     
FORECAST. LOCAL WIND GUST PROGRAM BASED ON THE NAM WOULD SUGGEST                
POSSIBLE WARNING CRITERIA GUSTS AS 50+ KT 800MB WINDS COVER THE                 
AREA. SNOW PACK AREAS MAY CREATE A SHALLOW INVERSION WHICH WOULD                
PREVENT FULL GUST POTENTIAL TO REACH THE SURFACE. FOR NOW HAVE                  
FOLLOWED THE SREF FOR WIND DIRECTION AND THE RUC/RUC13/MOS                      
GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR SUSTAINED WINDS. MIN TEMPS MONDAY NIGHT                    
WILL BE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW ZERO ACROSS FAR               
EASTERN COLORADO WITH SINGLE DIGITS ABOVE TO AROUND 10-15 ABOVE                 
ZERO ACROSS THE FAR EASTERN PARTS OF THE AREA. NORTHWEST WINDS OF               
15 TO 20 MPH WILL ALSO BE COMMON AS THE GRADIENT REMAINS TIGHT AND              
ATMOSPHERE MIXED.                                                               
FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT UPPER RIDGE AXIS PUSHES TOWARD THE                
FRONT RANGE BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. 850 TEMPERATURES HOWEVER                  
SHOW LITTLE CHANGE FROM MONDAYS READINGS. THIS WOULD AGAIN SUPPORT              
20S IN THE WEST AND NORTH WITH NEAR 30/LOW 30S ELSEWHERE. SHOULD                
SEE LOTS OF SUN WITH ONLY SOME CIRRUS POSSIBLE...NOT ENOUGH TO                  
IMPACT THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST. MIN TEMPS WILL AGAIN BE IN THE                 
SINGLE DIGITS WITH POSSIBLE BELOW ZERO READINGS ACROSS YUMA COUNTY

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST CONCERNS ARE TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE NEXT               
SEVERAL DAYS AND WINDS TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY AND THE IMPACT                    
EXISTING SNOW PACK WILL HAVE ON BOTH OF THEM.                                   
.SHORT TERM (TODAY-TUESDAY NIGHT)...                                            
WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS AND 850 TEMPERATURES WARMING SOME 4-9F                  
(COOLEST ACROSS THE NORTHWEST AND WEST WHERE DEEPEST SNOW PACK                  
EXISTS) WILL ALLOW FOR A BIT MORE MELTING ACROSS THE AREA AS                    
TEMPERATURES WARM INTO THE LOW 30S WEST AND NORTH WITH NEAR 40 AND              
SOME LOWER 40S ACROSS THE AREAS WHERE LITTLE OR NO SNOW PACK                    
EXISTS. THIS WARMING TREND WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS A 140+ KT 250                 
JET AND PACIFIC COLD FRONT MOVE INTO THE AREA DURING THE OVERNIGHT              
HOURS. LOW TEMPS WILL BE COLDEST ACROSS THE WEST...LESS COLD                    
ACROSS THE EAST. NORTHWEST WINDS IN THE 15-25/20-30 MPH RANGE WILL              
ALSO BE COMMON. AS FAR AS PRECIPITATION CHANCES...GFS STILL LOOKS               
OVERDONE WITH OVERALL MOISTURE PROFILES. NAM/NGM/RUC QUITE A BIT                
DRIER. IF THE GFS WERE TO VERIFY SOME LOW POPS MAY BE NEEDED FOR                
SOME LIGHT SHOWERS OR SILENT POPS FOR VIRGA AS THEY (NGM/NAM/GFS)               
SHOW SOME GOOD 700 FRONTOGENESIS WITHIN THE HIGHER 850-500                      
MOISTURE THAT THE GFS GENERATES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE                 
AREA. WILL BRIEF DAY SHIFT TO THIS BUT I DONT SEE ANYTHING                      
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.                                                            
FOR MONDAY 850 TEMPERATURES DROP ABOUT 15F ACROSS THE AREA WHICH                
ALONE WITH ONLY SUPPORT 20-25 ACROSS THE DEEPER SNOW PACK AREAS OF              
FAR EASTERN COLORADO AND SOUTHWEST NEBRASKA WITH 30 OR SO                       
ELSEWHERE. 21Z SREF TEMPS ALSO SIMILAR BUT THE MOS GUIDANCE SEEMS               
OUT TO LUNCH WHICH GIVEN THE SNOW PACK MAKES SENSE. ADD TO THAT                 
THE FACT THAT THE WIND WILL BE BLOWING FROM THE DEEPER SNOW PACK                
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE REST OF THE AREA...POSSIBLY FURTHER IMPACTING              
THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST. SPEAKING OF WINDS...ANOTHER TOUGH                     
FORECAST. LOCAL WIND GUST PROGRAM BASED ON THE NAM WOULD SUGGEST                
POSSIBLE WARNING CRITERIA GUSTS AS 50+ KT 800MB WINDS COVER THE                 
AREA. SNOW PACK AREAS MAY CREATE A SHALLOW INVERSION WHICH WOULD                
PREVENT FULL GUST POTENTIAL TO REACH THE SURFACE. FOR NOW HAVE                  
FOLLOWED THE SREF FOR WIND DIRECTION AND THE RUC/RUC13/MOS                      
GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR SUSTAINED WINDS. MIN TEMPS MONDAY NIGHT                    
WILL BE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW ZERO ACROSS FAR               
EASTERN COLORADO WITH SINGLE DIGITS ABOVE TO AROUND 10-15 ABOVE                 
ZERO ACROSS THE FAR EASTERN PARTS OF THE AREA. NORTHWEST WINDS OF               
15 TO 20 MPH WILL ALSO BE COMMON AS THE GRADIENT REMAINS TIGHT AND              
ATMOSPHERE MIXED.                                                               
FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT UPPER RIDGE AXIS PUSHES TOWARD THE                
FRONT RANGE BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. 850 TEMPERATURES HOWEVER                  
SHOW LITTLE CHANGE FROM MONDAYS READINGS. THIS WOULD AGAIN SUPPORT              
20S IN THE WEST AND NORTH WITH NEAR 30/LOW 30S ELSEWHERE. SHOULD                
SEE LOTS OF SUN WITH ONLY SOME CIRRUS POSSIBLE...NOT ENOUGH TO                  
IMPACT THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST. MIN TEMPS WILL AGAIN BE IN THE

FOR TEMPERATURES TODAY I USED FRIDAYS OBSERVED TEMPERATURES FROM                
ASOS AND MESONET SITES THEN ADDED APPROXIMATELY 5F TO ACCOUNT FOR               
850 WARMING AND LATEST 2M/MOS GUIDANCE AVERAGES.                                
SIMILARLY...SUNDAYS HIGHS SIMPLY ADDED ANOTHER 10F OR SO TO                     
SATURDAYS AS 850/2M/MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO WARM. SHARPLY              
COLDER ON MONDAY...ESPECIALLY WEST WHERE 850/2M/MOS NUMBERS FAVOR               
HIGHS ONLY 20S WHERE LOW/MID 30S EXPECTED ACROSS THE FAR SOUTH AND              
EAST. CONFIDENCE IS MODERATE IN THE TEMP FORECAST AS RECENT AND

WEDNESDAY PREVENTING ANY TYPE OF SUBSTANTIAL WARM UP DESPITE                    
BUILDING UPPER HEIGHTS FROM THE WEST. SHOULD HAVE SOME SNOW COVER               
AROUND...ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF FAR SOUTHWEST NEBRASKA AND EASTERN

850 TEMPERATURES AND THUS SURFACE TEMPERATURES. STILL THINKING                  
SNOW COVER WILL EXIST ACROSS THE FAR NORTH AND PARTS OF FAR                     
EASTERN COLORADO WHERE TEMPS HAVE BEEN TWEAKED CLOSER TO 40                     
DEGREES. ELSEWHERE...SNOW SHOULD JUST ABOUT BE GONE BY THIS TIME                
SO HAVE TRIED TO INCORPORATE STANDARD 850 TEMP BIAS` FOR THE ASOS               
SITES WHICH WOULD SUPPORT READINGS GENERALLY IN THE MID 40S.                    
THURSDAY...850 TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO WARM ABOUT 9F ACROSS THE

MINOR BUT STILL WORTHY ADJUSTMENTS TO SNOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE                 
REST OF TONIGHT ARE COMING UP AS OUR HIGH POP LOW QPF SCENARIO                  
CONTINUES TO UNFOLD.                                                            
THE LEAD UPPER LEVEL DEFORMATION PATTERN BRUSHING OUR FAR EASTERN               
COUNTIES HAS A COUPLE MORE HOURS LEFT IN IT BEFORE FORCING                      
TRANSITIONS TO THE WAVE SHEARING EASTWARD FROM THE CHICAGO AREA.                
THIS SYSTEM WILL BRUSH THE DETROIT AREA BUT MAINLY AFFECT THE                   
INTERSTATE 69 CORRIDOR INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. ALL OF THIS                    
DYNAMIC FORCING IS ACTING IN A SIMILAR ENVIRONMENT OF LOW MOISTURE              
BUT ALSO LOW STATIC STABILITY OR EVEN SHALLOW LAYERS OF                         
INSTABILITY IN THE MID LEVELS AS SHOWN IN MODEL CROSS SECTIONS.                 
THE RESULTING MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BATTLE DRY AIR IN THE LOW               
LEVELS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TRI CITIES, FOR THE DURATION OF THE                   
EVENT.                                                                          
EXPECT THINGS TO TAPER OFF AROUND 3 AM AS THE UPPER WAVE SHEARS                 
TO OUR EAST. UNTIL THEN, WE WILL HANG ON TO CATEGORICAL POPS A                  
LITTLE FARTHER NORTH INTO FLINT AND A LONGER INTO THE NIGHT, BUT                
WITH SOME DURATION QUALIFIERS TO GO ALONG WITH ACCUMULATION LESS                
THAN AN INCH.

AREAL COVERAGE AND DURATION OF LIGHT SNOW WILL BE THE MAIN CONCERN              
EARLY THIS AVIATION FORECAST CYCLE. AT THIS POINT, IT LOOKS LIKE THE            
DETROIT AREA WILL BE IMPACTED MAINLY DURING THE EVENING HOURS WITH              
MVFR VISIBILITY AND CEILING IN LIGHT SNOW. IFR CONDITIONS WILL BE ON            
THE BRIEF SIDE AT ALL TERMINALS BUT FLINT AND TRI CITIES HAVE A                 
CHANCE AT A LONGER DURATION MVFR SITUATION AS A SYSTEM OVER CHICAGO             
MOVES THROUGH CENTRAL LOWER MICHIGAN LATE THIS EVENING AND EARLY IN             
THE OVERNIGHT.                                                                  
THE SNOW WILL END LATE TONIGHT AND BE REPLACED BY STRATUS AND LIGHT             
FOG AS MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER AIR MOVES IN FROM ILLINOIS AND INDIANA.             
MVFR CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST INTO MONDAY AFTERNOON BEFORE GIVING WAY            
TO SLIGHT VISIBILITY IMPROVEMENT. SNOW FROM THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE               
SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO HOLD OFF UNTIL MONDAY EVENING.

HIGH POP/LOW QPF SNOW MINI-EVENT EXPECTED FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF              
THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...ROUGHLY SOUTH OF I-69. NORTH OF                     
THERE...JUST SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS. HIGHEST SNOW                              
ACCUMULATIONS...ONLY ABOUT AN INCH...ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THE             
FAR SOUTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE STATE...FROM ST CLAIR COUNTY                    
SOUTHWARD DOWN TO MONROE COUNTY.                                                
UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVING THROUGH THE CORN BELT THIS AFTERNOON WILL              
MOVE THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF NIGHT. WHILE              
MAIN SURFACE REFLECTION WILL STAY OVER THE CAROLINAS...PAST SEVERAL             
MODEL SUITES HAVE SHOWN A SECONDARY REFLECTION DEVELOPING OVER WEST             
VIRGINIA AND TRACKING UP THROUGH WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA DURING THE                
LATE EVENING. MSAS SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS DO                 
INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF THIS FEATURE...AND 12Z MODELS WERE                     
DEFINITELY TOO WEAK WITH IT. ALREADY SOME EVIDENCE OF A DEFORMATION             
BAND FORMING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM PER OBS AND SATELLITE             
IMAGERY...AND MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING THIS                   
DEFORMATION ZONE INTO SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN AFTER 00Z TONIGHT. SYSTEM              
WILL NOT HAVE MUCH TO WORK WITH AS JET DYNAMICS WILL REMAIN JUST TO             
OUR SOUTHEAST...AND NO DECENT INFLUX OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL                 
OCCUR. WILL SEE SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT HOWEVER...AND FORCING DOES LOOK            
TO BE CENTERED IN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE ALLOWING FOR MAXIMUM                
CRYSTAL GROWTH. OVERALL...LIKE THE RUC AND NGM QPF FIELDS THE BEST.             
DID HOWEVER LEAN TOWARDS THE HIGHER END OF THE MODEL QPF                        
FIELDS...GIVEN THAT THE MODELS ARE UNDERDONE WITH THE SYSTEM                    
INTENSITY. WITH THE LOW CENTER ALREADY SO FAR TO OUR EAST SNOWFALL              
WILL BE LIGHT AND FAIRLY SHORT IN DURATION...MOSTLY OCCURRING WITHIN            
A 4 TO 6 HOUR WINDOW THIS EVENING. PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE OUT OF               
SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN BY 4 AM.                                                     
IN THE WAKE OF THIS LITTLE SYSTEM...LOW CLOUDS AND MIST WILL LINGER             
THROUGH THE NIGHT. SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL ALSO BECOME ESTABLISHED LATE             
TONIGHT AS THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST                  
BECOMES BETTER ORGANIZED AND STARTS TO ADVANCE INTO THE WESTERN                 
GREAT LAKES.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS DEPICTING WEAK SHORTWAVE                   
ENERGY EJECTING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THIS                     
AFTERNOON. THIS ENERGY WILL ORGANIZE INTO A STRONGER SHORTWAVE                  
ACROSS THE PLAINS TONIGHT...AND EVENTUALLY INDUCE WEAK SFC                      
CYCLOGENESIS AS IT PULLS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY. MODEL                
TRENDS SINCE THE 00Z CYCLE HAVE BEEN TOWARD A WEAKER AND MORE                   
SOUTHERLY TRACK OF THE MAIN SFC LOW...WITH A SECOND WEAKER SFC                  
REFLECTION INDICATED WITHIN THE UNPHASED FLOW ACROSS SOUTHERN                   
CANADA. THE 12Z GFS...WITH SUPPORT FROM THE 12Z WRF-HEMI AND                    
CANADIAN...TAKES THE LOW FROM CENTRAL IL ACROSS NORTHERN IN AND                 
INTO LAKE ERIE. THE NAM REMAINS THE FURTHEST SOUTH...KEEPING A                  
STRONGER/MORE COMPACT LOW ACROSS SOUTHERN IN/NORTHEAST OHIO. THE                
12Z ECMWF APPEARS TO BE A GOOD COMPROMISE...MAINTAINING A                       
SLIGHTLY MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK THAN THE GFS...WHILE ALLOWING FOR                 
BETTER NORTHWARD EXPANSION OF THE MOISTURE/PCPN SHIELD INTO                     
SOUTHEAST LOWER MI COMPARED TO THE VERY DRY LOOKING NAM.                        
FORCING WILL BE LACKING INITIALLY...AND WILL PULL BACK ON POPS FOR              
THE MORNING HOURS.  HOWEVER...BY LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING THE                     
INCREASING LARGE SCALE ACCENT PROVIDED BY THE UPPER TROUGH AND WEAK             
LOW/MID LEVEL DEFORMATION WILL HELP OVERCOME A LIMITED MOISTURE                 
SOURCE TO BRING SNOW TO ALL OF SOUTHEAST LOWER MI.  MODELS INDICATE             
THE MAIN AXIS OF LARGE SCALE FORCING/OMEGA WILL EXIST JUST SOUTH OF             
THE STATE LINE...LEAVING THE HIGHEST QPF BANDS JUST OUT OF OUR                  
AREA.  HOWEVER...GIVEN THE ANTICIPATED LOW TRACK AND OVERALL                    
VERTICAL MOTION/MOISTURE FIELDS...A BROAD 1-2 INCH SWATH OF SNOWFALL            
STILL SEEMS PLAUSIBLE BY 06Z MONDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE               
SOUTHERN HALF.  THE POTENTIAL DOES EXIST FOR HIGHER AMOUNTS                     
APPROACHING 3 INCHES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO TIER OF COUNTIES...AND             
WILL NEED TO MONITOR FOR A POSSIBLE NORTHWARD ADJUSTMENT IN THE                 
TRACK AND BETTER FORCING. WHERE GOOD SYNOPTIC FORCING LACKS ACROSS              
THE THUMB REGION...SOME ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL MAY COME FROM LAKE                  
EFFECT ENHANCEMENT. THE ONLY AREA THAT MAY STRUGGLE TO SEE MUCH                 
SYNOPTIC ACCUMULATION WILL BE IN THE SAGINAW VALLEY...AND WILL                  
SCALE BACK QPF/SNOW AMOUNTS SLIGHTLY HERE.                                      
12Z MODEL SUITE REMAIN IN STRONG AGREEMENT AND CARRY GOOD RUN TO RUN            
CONTINUITY WITH THE PATTERN EVOLUTION BY MIDWEEK.  THE WEAKER SYSTEM            
LIFTING THROUGH MONDAY WILL LEAD IN A STRONGER SHORTWAVE FOR                    
TUESDAY...WITH THIS ENERGY CARVING OUT A DEEPER LONGWAVE TROUGH AND             
ALLOWING A BRIEF SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR TO SPILL IN FOR TUESDAY NIGHT/              
WEDNESDAY. STRENGTHENING COLD AIR ADVECTION ON TUESDAY WITH 850 MB              
TEMPERATURES DROPPING BELOW -10C WILL CREATE MARGINALLY FAVORABLE               
CONDITIONS FOR LAKE ENHANCED SNOW SHOWERS DURING THE DAY. THE                   
LATEST GFS INDICATING A NARROW CONVERGENCE ZONE DEVELOPING ACROSS               
THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE THUMB...WITH A SMALL WINDOW OF                       
PREDOMINANT NORTH-NORTHEAST FLOW OVER LAKE HURON INCREASING THE                 
POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER SNOW AMOUNTS IN THESE LOCATIONS LATE TUESDAY.              
MORE ORGANIZED ACTIVITY WILL DEVELOP BY TUESDAY EVENING AREAWIDE                
AS FORCING/CONVERGENCE INCREASES ALONG THE ARCTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY              
DROPPING SOUTH ACROSS SOUTHERN MI...AND LIKELY POPS REMAIN                      
APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PERIOD. OVERALL...ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS UP              
TO 2 INCHES (HIGHEST NORTH) STILL SEEMS REASONABLE AREAWIDE...WITH              
LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN THE FAVORED LAKE                  
ENHANCED AREAS ACROSS THE THUMB.                                                
ARCTIC AIRMASS WILL SETTLE OVERHEAD BRIEFLY FOR WEDNESDAY...WITH                
LINGERING SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS.  BASED ON PROJECTED 850 MB/                   
THICKNESS TRENDS...TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY HOLD STEADY OR SLOWLY               
FALL...AND NOT REACH MUCH ABOVE THE LOWER 20S.  AT LEAST PARTIAL                
CLEARING WEDNESDAY NIGHT...COMBINED WITH A WEAKENING GRADIENT WITH              
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY...WILL BRING THE                  
COLDEST NIGHT OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  GOING FORECAST WITH LOWS                 
BOTTOMING OUT IN THE 5-10F RANGE STILL LOOKING GOOD FOR THURSDAY                
MORNING.                                                                        
BIG PATTERN CHANGE FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...AS              
MODEL CONSENSUS PLACES THE GREAT LAKES WITHIN AN INCREASINGLY DEEP              
SOUTHWEST FLOW...BETWEEN STRENGTHENING RIDGING ACROSS THE EAST COAST            
AND A LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN THIRD OF THE CONUS.  THIS                
WILL LEAD TO A PRONOUNCED WARMUP BY THE WEEKEND...WITH 850 MB TEMPS             
CLIMBING INTO THE 5-10C RANGE BY SUNDAY.  IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO             
SCOUR OUT THE ARCTIC AIR INITIALLY...AND WILL CONTINUE TO TEMPER THE            
WARMUP ON THURSDAY...AS THE COLD MORNING START AND SNOW COVER                   
POTENTIAL WILL CERTAINLY COUNTER ANY INCREASE IN WARM AIR ADVECTION/            
RISING THICKNESSES.   HOWEVER...BY THE WEEKEND EXPECT TEMPERATURES              
TO CLIMB WELL ABOVE NORMAL...WITH HIGHS ON SUNDAY POTENTIALLY                   
APPROACHING 50F ACROSS THE SOUTH. INCREASING ISENTROPIC ACCENT AND              
THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL BRING THE NEXT CHANCE OF PCPN              
BY SATURDAY...WITH THE THERMAL PROFILES LOOKING MORE LIKE ALL                   
RAIN.

AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BECOME ORGANIZED OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST            
TONIGHT. THIS SYSTEM WILL DEEPEN AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN                
GREAT LAKES MONDAY NIGHT...AND CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY THROUGH TUESDAY            
AS IT TRACKS INTO NEW ENGLAND. MEANWHILE...A VERY LARGE AND STRONG              
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN ITS WAKE TUESDAY OVER THE                   
CENTRAL PLAINS. WITH OUR AREA IN THE CENTER OF THESE TWO

WV IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS INDICATED A BROAD TROF OVER THE CONUS               
WITH THE MAIN BAROCLINIC ZONE AND JET ENERGY WELL TO THE SOUTH.                 
SEVERAL WEAK SHORTWAVES WERE EMBEDDED IN THE WEAKER FLOW FROM THE               
PLAINS INTO THE UPPER GREAT LAKES. ONE WAS MOVING THROUGH NW MN                 
WHILE ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE WAS IN LINE OVER SE SASKATCHEWAN                   
AHEAD OF A STRONGER SHORTWAVE OVER NRN SASK. AT THE SFC...WEAK SRLY             
FLOW PREVAILED OVER UPPER MI AS A WEAK TROUGH EXTENDED INTO NRN LAKE            
SUPERIOR FROM LOW PRES OVER NW MN AND THE ERN DAKOTAS. VIS LOOP                 
SHOWED THAT CLEAR PATCHES THAT HAD DEVELOPED WERE GIVING WAY TO                 
INCREASING CLOUDS WITH CONTINUED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM              
WI. SSW FLOW OFF OF LAKE MI HAS BROUGHT SCT -SHSN TO THE ERN CWA                
FROM E OF KISQ TO KERY.                                                         
TONIGHT...EXPECT LITTLE MORE THAN PATCHY FLURRIES THIS EVENING WITH             
ONLY WEAK WAA AND LOW LEVEL (925-850 MB LAYER) ISENTROPIC LIFT                  
CONTINUING. ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS INCLUDED OVERNIGHT AS                       
WAA/ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASE AND 850-700 MOISTURE INCREASES AHEAD OF            
THE TROUGH MOVING IN FROM THE ERN DAKOTAS. LIGHT LES INTO THE                   
ERN CWA SHOULD ALSO DIMINISH THIS EVENING AS THE LOW LEVEL WINDS                
BECOME LIGHT AND DISORGANIZED. THE NAM AND LCL HIGH RES WRF/ARW ALSO            
SUGGEST THAT THE MORE FAVORABLE LOW LEVEL CONV WILL SHIFT EAST OF               
THE CWA OVERNIGHT.                                                              
MONDAY...MODELS DEPICTION OF A 850-700 MB SHORTWAVE...STRONGEST WITH            
THE GFS...WOULD BRING ADDITIONAL BAND OF 280-285K ISENTROPIC LIFT               
AND POTENTIAL FOR LIGHT SNOW ACROSS THE AREA. SNOW CHANCES WILL                 
INCREASE LATE ACROSS THE WEST AS WINDS VEER WNW. 850 MB TEMPS DOWN              
TO NEAR -13C WITH DEEP MOISTURE AND CYCLONIC FLOW WILL SUPPORT SOME             
LIGHT LES OR LAKE ENHANCED SNOW LATE. WITH LATE ONSET ACCUMULATIONS             
BY EVENING SHOULD STILL REMAIN AN INCH OR LESS.                                 
.LONG TERM (MON NIGHT THRU SUN)...                                              
MAIN FCST CONCERN IS THE LAKE EFFECT SNOW EVENT MON NIGHT THRU TUE              
NIGHT. THE LAST FEW MODELS RUNS HAVE SHOWN A SHARP SFC TROF DROPPING            
S ACROSS LAKE SUPERIOR MON NIGHT/TUE MORNING IN RESPONSE TO A                   
SHORTWAVE DIVING FROM THE NRN PLAINS TO THE OHIO VALLEY. WHILE BEST             
FORCING WITH SHORWAVE WILL PASS W AND S OF THE FCST AREA...                     
CONDITIONS WILL STILL BE FAVORABLE FOR A PERIOD OF MDT TO POSSIBLY              
HVY LAKE ENHANCED SNOW LATE MON NIGHT/TUE AS MIDLEVEL TROF AXIS                 
PASSES. DEVELOPING SFC TROF OVER LAKE SUPERIOR MON NIGHT WILL LEAD              
TO INCREASINGLY CYCLONIC FLOW OVER THE LAKE WITH W TO NW WINDS AHEAD            
OF TROF FAVORING THE WRN COUNTIES FOR DEVELOPING LAKE ENHANCED SNOW.            
FOR THE MOST PART...WRLY WINDS OVER NCNTRL UPPER MI WILL KEEP MAIN              
SNOW AREA OFFSHORE UNTIL TROF PASSAGE TUE MORNING. ONCE WINDS SHIFT             
NRLY BEHIND TROF EARLY TUE MORNING...EXPECT HEAVIEST SNOW TO SETTLE             
OVER WRN GOGEBIC/ONTONAGON COUNTIES AND MARQUETTE/WRN ALGER                     
COUNTIES. DEEP MOISTURE...CYCLONIC UPSLOPE FLOW AND MODEL TIME                  
SECTIONS SHOWING A NICE INTERSECTION OF UPWARD MOTION WITHIN FALLING            
LAYER OF FAVORABLE DENDRITIC SNOW GROWTH TEMPS UNDER CAA REGIME                 
SUGGEST THIS EVENT MAY REACH WARNING CRITERIA (8 INCHES IN 12HRS OR             
10 IN 24HRS) IN SOME LOCATIONS. CONFIDENCE AT THIS POINT IS JUST                
SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO ISSUE WATCHES. HAVE STARTED LAKE EFFECT SNOW               
WATCH AT 00Z TUE OVER THE WRN COUNTIES SINCE FLOW IS W TO NW AHEAD              
OF SFC TROF. HOWEVER...SNOW SHOULDN`T REALLY PICK UP UNTIL AFTER                
MIDNIGHT. STARTED WATCH AT 12Z TUE FOR MARQUETTE/ALGER COUNTIES WITH            
EXPECTATION OF WIND SHIFT TO THE N ARRIVING NEAR THAT TIME. LEFT                
LUCE COUNTY OUT OF WATCH SINCE WINDS SHIFT N TO NE MINIMIZING                   
OVERWATER TRAJECTORY THERE. ALSO...OPTED TO LEAVE BARAGA COUNTY OUT             
OF WATCH DUE TO SHORTER PERIOD OF FAVORABLE WIND DIRECTION THERE. AT            
THIS TIME...IT APPEARS GOGEBIC/ONTONAGON COUNTIES WILL SEE THE                  
GREATEST SNOW ACCUMULATIONS (AND MOST LIKELY TO REACH WARNING                   
AMOUNTS) FROM THIS EVENT DUE TO LONGEST PERIOD OF FAVORABLE WIND                
DIRECTION AND DUE TO AIRMASS PASSING OVER WRN LAKE SUPERIOR BEING               
COLDER. TIME PERIOD OF HEAVIEST SNOW SHOULD BE AFTER MIDNIGHT INTO              
EARLY TUE MORNING FOR THE KEWEENAW...AFTER MIDNIGHT MON THRU TUE                
AFTN FOR GOGEBIC/ONTONAGON AND DURING THE DAY TUE FOR                           
MARQUETTE/ALGER. ALTHOUGH WATCHES WILL RUN TO 12Z WED...SNOW WILL BE            
QUITE A BIT LIGHTER DURING THE PURE LES PHASE TUE NIGHT.                        
HIGH PRES RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE WRN LAKES WED AND PASS THRU THE             
AREA WED NIGHT...BRINGING AN END TO LES FROM W TO E AS WINDS BACK               
FROM NW TO SW. TEMPS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLUMMET DURING                 
THE SHORT PERIOD OF RIDGE PASSAGE WED NIGHT. READINGS COULD BE                  
SEVERAL DEGREES LOWER THAN WHAT THIS FCST ISSUANCE REFLECTS. FOR                
NOW...HAVE MIN TEMPS AT OR JUST BLO ZERO OVER MUCH OF THE INTERIOR.             
THU THRU SUN...UNFORTUNATELY FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY WINTER SNOW                    
ACTIVITIES...THE LONG ADVERTISED GFS/ECWMF CHANGE IN THE PATTERN TO             
A MAJOR WARMUP TO WELL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS WILL BE UNDERWAY DURING               
THIS PERIOD AS MEAN TROF POSITION SETTLES INTO THE FAR ERN                      
PACIFIC/WRN NAMERICA AND RIDGE BUILDS OVER ERN NAMERICA. BEYOND THIS            
FCST PERIOD INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...UNUSUAL WARMTH IS LIKELY TO                  
PERSIST. LOOKS LIKE SOME RECORD HIGH MAX TEMPS AND RECORD HIGH MIN              
TEMPS WILL BE SET DURING THIS WARM PERIOD. MIN TEMP RECORDS WILL BE             
MORE LIKELY TO BE SET AS MINS WILL BE ESPECIALLY AFFECTED BY THE                
WARMING...SHOWING INCREASINGLY GREATER DEPARTURES FROM NORMAL THAN              
MAX TEMPS AS THE WARMING TREND LENGTHENS AND CLOUDS/INCREASINGLY                
MOIST AIRMASS LIMIT TEMP FALLS AT NIGHT. SHOULD SEE A COUPLE OF DAYS            
WHERE TEMPS DON`T FALL BACK BLO FREEZING. AS FOR PCPN...HAVE OPTED              
TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS OF FCSTS WITH               
REGARD TO LOW POPS FOR -SN THU/THU NIGHT. ALTHOUGH GFS/ECMWF SUGGEST            
A RATHER DRY AIRMASS...STRONG WAA PATTERN (850MB WINDS TO 50KT OVER             
UPPER MI RESULTING FROM SHORTWAVE TRACKING THRU NRN ONTARIO/HUDSON              
BAY REGION) IS SUPPORTIVE OF MAINTAINING A MENTION OF POSSIBLE -SN              
FOR ONE MORE FCST ISSUANCE. FIRST SHORTWAVE HEADING NE FROM THE NEW             
E PACIFIC/WRN N AMERICA TROF SHOULD MAKE A RUN ACROSS THE PLAINS TO             
THE GREAT LAKES FRI NIGHT/SAT...BRINGING SOME -RN...WHICH WILL                  
LIKELY BEGIN AS -SN/-FZRA FRI NIGHT. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE AND SURGE OF             
WAA WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF PCPN SUN. SHOULD BE ALL RAIN AT THAT            
TIME AS LOW-LEVEL WARM AIR WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY THEN PER                      
GFS/ECWMF. BEYOND THIS FCST PERIOD...THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS IN             
SEVERAL OF THE RECENT GFS/ECMWF RUNS THAT A SIGNIFICANT RAIN EVENT              
(MAY INCLUDE THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL) WILL OCCUR AT SOME POINT DURING

MVFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE PERIOD AT KSAW AND MOST OF             
THE PERIOD AT KCMX. WHEN THE SNOW STARTS AT KCMX IN THE AFTERNOON               
AND THE WIND SWINGS AROUND TO THE WEST...LAKE ENHANCEMENT WILL BEGIN            
AND CONDITIONS WILL GO TO IFR TO LIFR LATE IN THE AFTERNOON.

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 PM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN LAKES WILL GIVE WAY TO A                  
DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE UPPER GREAT LAKES MONDAY. AS A RESULT...             
WINDS SHOULD REMAIN BLO 25 KNOTS. A LOW OVER LAKE SUPERIOR MONDAY               
NIGHT WILL SLIDE QUICKLY TO THE SOUTHEAST AS A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE             
OVER THE PLAINS BUILDS TOWARD THE AREA. A TIGHT PRES GRADIENT                   
BETWEEN THESE FEATURES WILL BRING A PERIOD OF NORTHERLY GALES                   
TUESDAY AS STRONG CAA RESULTS IN STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER MIXING. LOOK             
FOR WINDS TO DIMINISH TO BLO 25 KTS BY WED EVENING AS THE HIGH PRES

AREAL COVERAGE AND DURATION OF LIGHT SNOW WILL BE THE MAIN CONCERN

MODEL SUITES HAVE SHOWN A SECONDARY REFLECTION DEVELOPING OVER WEST             
VIRGINIA AND TRACKING UP THROUGH WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA DURING THE                
LATE EVENING. MSAS SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS DO                 
INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF THIS FEATURE...AND 12Z MODELS WERE                     
DEFINITELY TOO WEAK WITH IT. ALREADY SOME EVIDENCE OF A DEFORMATION             
BAND FORMING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM PER OBS AND SATELLITE             
IMAGERY...AND MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING THIS                   
DEFORMATION ZONE INTO SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN AFTER 00Z TONIGHT. SYSTEM              
WILL NOT HAVE MUCH TO WORK WITH AS JET DYNAMICS WILL REMAIN JUST TO             
OUR SOUTHEAST...AND NO DECENT INFLUX OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL                 
OCCUR. WILL SEE SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT HOWEVER...AND FORCING DOES LOOK            
TO BE CENTERED IN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE ALLOWING FOR MAXIMUM                
CRYSTAL GROWTH. OVERALL...LIKE THE RUC AND NGM QPF FIELDS THE BEST.             
DID HOWEVER LEAN TOWARDS THE HIGHER END OF THE MODEL QPF

WILL BE LIGHT AND FAIRLY SHORT IN DURATION...MOSTLY OCCURRING WITHIN            
A 4 TO 6 HOUR WINDOW THIS EVENING. PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE OUT OF

ENERGY EJECTING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THIS

CYCLOGENESIS AS IT PULLS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY. MODEL                
TRENDS SINCE THE 00Z CYCLE HAVE BEEN TOWARD A WEAKER AND MORE                   
SOUTHERLY TRACK OF THE MAIN SFC LOW...WITH A SECOND WEAKER SFC                  
REFLECTION INDICATED WITHIN THE UNPHASED FLOW ACROSS SOUTHERN                   
CANADA. THE 12Z GFS...WITH SUPPORT FROM THE 12Z WRF-HEMI AND

INTO LAKE ERIE. THE NAM REMAINS THE FURTHEST SOUTH...KEEPING A                  
STRONGER/MORE COMPACT LOW ACROSS SOUTHERN IN/NORTHEAST OHIO. THE                
12Z ECMWF APPEARS TO BE A GOOD COMPROMISE...MAINTAINING A                       
SLIGHTLY MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK THAN THE GFS...WHILE ALLOWING FOR

INCREASING LARGE SCALE ACCENT PROVIDED BY THE UPPER TROUGH AND WEAK             
LOW/MID LEVEL DEFORMATION WILL HELP OVERCOME A LIMITED MOISTURE

INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF THIS FEATURE...AND 12Z MODELS WERE                     
DEFINITELY TOO WEAK WITH IT. ALREADY SOME EVIDENCE OF A DEFORMATION             
BAND FORMING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM PER OBS AND SATELLITE             
IMAGERY...AND MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING THIS                   
DEFORMATION ZONE INTO SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN AFTER 00Z TONIGHT. SYSTEM              
WILL NOT HAVE MUCH TO WORK WITH AS JET DYNAMICS WILL REMAIN JUST TO             
OUR SOUTHEAST...AND NO DECENT INFLUX OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL                 
OCCUR. WILL SEE SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT HOWEVER...AND FORCING DOES LOOK            
TO BE CENTERED IN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE ALLOWING FOR MAXIMUM                
CRYSTAL GROWTH. OVERALL...LIKE THE RUC AND NGM QPF FIELDS THE BEST.             
DID HOWEVER LEAN TOWARDS THE HIGHER END OF THE MODEL QPF                        
FIELDS...GIVEN THAT THE MODELS ARE UNDERDONE WITH THE SYSTEM                    
INTENSITY. WITH THE LOW CENTER ALREADY SO FAR TO OUR EAST SNOWFALL              
WILL BE LIGHT AND FAIRLY SHORT IN DURATION...MOSTLY OCCURRING WITHIN            
A 4 TO 6 HOUR WINDOW THIS EVENING. PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE OUT OF

WV AND 500MB RUC ANALYSIS SHOW A LONGWAVE TROUGH SPREAD ACROSS THE              
CONUS. THERE IS A STRONG SHORTWAVE AT THE BASE OF THE TROUGH                    
SITUATED ON THE OK/TX BORDER...AND ANOTHER SHORTWAVE OVER                       
WASHINGTON. THE OK/TX SHORTWAVE WILL DIG ITS WAY INTO THE OHIO RIVER            
VALLEY TODAY AND TONIGHT AND NOT REALLY IMPACT OUR CWA. THE WA                  
SHORTWAVE WILL DIG AN AMPLIFIED TROUGH THROUGH THE CENTRAL CONUS ON             
MONDAY AND PLAY A PART IN OUR WEATHER ON TUE. MEANWHILE...A VORTEX              
OVER NORTH CENTRAL CANADA IS PROGGED TO DIP DOWN INTO MN AROUND 12Z             
TUE. THIS STRONG 500MB SHORTWAVE WILL INTERACT WITH THE WA TROUGH               
AND SFC LOW PRES WILL STRENGTHEN OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AREA TUE            
MORNING. BEHIND THE SFC LOW...ARCTIC AIR WILL FILTER DOWN ACROSS                
LAKE SUPERIOR AND KICK UP SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT LAKE ENHANCED AND

TODAY...LIGHT SNOW/FLURRIES ARE SPREAD ACROSS UPPER MI AND NORTH                
CENTRAL WI AS WAA AND WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT FILTER INTO THE AREA. A              
VERY WEAK SHORTWAVE OVER THE REGION IS ALSO APPARENT IN WV IMAGERY.             
KEPT ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS GOING FOR MOST OF THE CWA THROUGH EARLY              
AFTERNOON. A WEAK CONVERGENCE ZONE SITUATED OVER LAKE SUPERIOR WILL             
KEEP SNOW SHOWERS GOING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...SLOWLY LIFTING                  
NORTHWARD AND AWAY FROM THE KEWEENAW.                                           
TONIGHT AND MONDAY...WAA AND WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO             
SOME LIGHT SNOW OVERNIGHT...MAINLY OVER THE FAR EASTERN U.P. (LAKE              
ENHANCEMENT OFF OF LAKE MICHIGAN WITH THE SOUTHERLY FLOW). THERE IS             
MOISTURE AVAILABLE...BUT BETTER FORCING AND MORE MOISTURE ENTER THE             
PICTURE AFTER MIDNIGHT. FOR NOW...KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR THE WHOLE                
NIGHT...BUT MAY BE ABLE TO INCREASE POPS FOR AFTER 06Z DURING NEXT              
FORECAST UPDATE. MONDAY...SIMILAR FORCING CONTINUES. RAISED POPS                
SLIGHTLY IN THE AFTERNOON TO ACCOUNT FOR DEEPER MOISTURE. STILL HAVE            
LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN COVERAGE OF THIS PCPN.                                     
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...LAKE ENHANCED SNOW WILL BEGIN

WITH 20:1 SNOW RATIO FOR MON NIGHT...THEN INCREASED THE RATIO TO                
25:1 FOR TUE...AND INCREASED IT EVEN MORE TO 30:1 FOR TUE NIGHT AND             
WED. AS TWO UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVES CROSS OVER LAKE SUPERIOR MON                 
NIGHT THROUGH TUE...SNOWFALL MAY TOTAL UP TO WARNING CRITERIA IN                
SOME LAKE SUPERIOR SHORELINE AREAS. DID NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO                 
GOING QPF/SNOWFALL FIELDS. DECREASED LOW TEMPS TUE NIGHT...HIGH

SATELLITE LOOPS SUGGESTS THAT AREAS OF MAINLY CLEAR SKIES OVER WEST

AND ADVECTION OF MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTH WHERE MORE PROMINENT                   
STRATUS WAS OBSERVED. BY TONIGHT MVFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THAT              
SHOULD PERSIST INTO MON MORNING AS A STRONG 3K-4K FT INVERSION                  
PERSISTS OVER THE REGION.

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA SHOULD KEEP WINDS BLO 25 KNOTS INTO            
MONDAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TAKING SHAPE IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS               
WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE UPPER GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY. A TIGHT NRLY               
GRADIENT WILL DEVELOP ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW ON MON NIGHT INTO              
TUE AS STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE PLAINS. KEPT GOING FCST             
OF WINDS TO 30 KT ALTHOUGH GALE FORCE GUSTS ARE CERTAINLY POSSIBLE              
AS COLD ADVECTION/MIXING ALLOWS HIGHER WIND GUSTS TO REACH THE                  
SURFACE OF THE LAKE. LOOK FOR WINDS TO DIMINISH TO BLO 25 KTS BY WED            
EVENING AS THE HIGH PRES RIDGE FROM THE PLAINS MOVES OVER THE

A RIDGE OF SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE FROM CENTRAL WISCONSIN INTO                    
SOUTHERN OHIO IS MOVING SLOWLY TO THE NORTHEAST EARLY THIS MORNING,             
AND HELPING TO SCOUR AWAY THE STRATUS IN ITS WAKE. THIS IS                      
CORRELATED NICELY ON SATELLITE AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE                
EDGE OF THE STRATUS LINED UP ROUGHLY ALONG THE RIDGE AXIS. THE                  
CLEARING LINE WILL MAKE IT TO THE DETROIT AREA AROUND SUNRISE BUT               
THE PLAN IS TO DELAY THE TIMING AT FLINT AND TRI CITES UNTIL LATER              
IN THE MORNING OR CLOSER TO NOON AS THE RIDGE AXIS REORIENTS ITSELF             
MORE SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. A SHORT BREAK OF VFR CONDITIONS IS THEN            
EXPECTED AT DETROIT BEFORE MOISTURE ARRIVES FROM THE SOUTH AGAIN BY             
EVENING. SOME LIGHT SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THE EVENING HOURS

SHORT TERM...THROUGH TONIGHT                                                    
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT AND               
EXTEND UP INTO THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES. THIS WILL BRING DRY WEATHER            
AND ALLOW WINDS TO RELAX.                                                       
MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGE FOR THE SHORT TERM REMAINS CENTERED AROUND              
THE POSSIBLE BREAK-UP OF THE STRATUS DECK ENTRENCHED OVER THE                   
REGION. WESTERLY FLOW OFF LAKE MICHIGAN HAS HELPED KEEP THIS DECK               
INTACT THIS AFTERNOON. 12Z DTX SOUNDING INDICATES THE MIXED LAYER TO            
BE POTENTIALLY 5000 FEET DEEP...BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS                
LAYER SHRINKING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS INVERSION HEIGHTS LOWER.               
FORECAST SOUNDINGS ALSO SHOW THE AIRMASS REMAINING FAIRLY SATURATED             
IN THE LOWER LEVELS THROUGH MUCH OF THE AFTERNOON...BEFORE SOME                 
DRIER AIR IS MIXED DOWN DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON. MODELS LOOK TOO              
AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS MIXING AS THEY ARE TOO WARM WITH SURFACE                   
TEMPERATURES AND AT LEAST 1000 FEET TOO LOW WITH THE INVERSION                  
HEIGHTS (WHERE DRIER AIR RESIDES ABOVE). THINK THE LOWER LAYERS WILL            
STAY A LITTLE MORE MOIST THAN INDICATED...FAVORING A MORE INTACT                
DECK.                                                                           
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A SMALL UPPER SHORTWAVE TRACKING UP                   
THROUGH ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. NAM AND RUC MODELS HAVE THE BEST                  
HANDLE ON THIS FEATURE...BUT LARGELY SHEAR IT OUT BEFORE IT REACHES             
THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE MICHIGAN/OHIO BORDER BY 00Z. UPSTREAM                
OVER ILLINOIS...THIS FEATURE HAS HELPED CLEAR OUT MOST OF THE                   
STRATUS. HOWEVER...NOT SURE IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK UP THE            
DECK OVER THE SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA.                                           
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THIS INFORMATION...WILL KEEP THE DECK                   
LARGELY INTACT FOR THE AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE. EXPECTING A FEW              
BREAKS TO APPEAR DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING HOWEVER.               
CIRRUS SHIELD WILL EXPAND OVERNIGHT FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE             
OHIO VALLEY AS THE BROAD UPPER TROUGH CROSSING THE ROCKIES BECOMES              
MORE AMPLIFIED. HIGH CLOUDS WILL START TO SPREAD INTO THE SOUTHERN              
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE EARLY MORNING...THROUGH THEY               
WILL ARRIVE TOO LATE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON TEMPERATURES. OVERNIGHT            
LOWS WILL RUN 8 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW LAST NIGHT`S MILD

THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND INDUCES COASTAL ATLANTIC CYCLOGENESIS.                 
TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY WILL REBOUND SLIGHTLY FROM TODAY...AS THE                
GRADIENT TAKES ON MORE OF A SOUTHERLY COMPONENT AND THINNER                     
HIGH/MID CLOUDS CONTROL THE SKY CONDITION. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS                 
HINT AT SECONDARY WEAK SFC LOW DEVELOPMENT WEST OF THE

ALONG THE DEFORMATION AXIS LIFTING NORTHEAST FROM SOUTHWEST OHIO                
THROUGH LAKE ERIE SUNDAY EVENING. THE VERY NORTHWEST EDGE OF THIS

SLIGHT CHANCE POP THROUGH 06Z FROM MONROE TO MACOMB COUNTY FOR                  
VERY LGT SNOW SHOWERS WITH NO ACCUMS EXPECTED. OTHERWISE...WILL

STRATUS REMAINS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED ALONG AND NORTH OF THE SURFACE                
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE, AND OVER SE MICHIGAN, THIS EVENING. SATELLITE              
IMAGERY DOES SHOW THE EDGE MAKING PROGRESS TO THE NORTHEAST THROUGH             
ILLINOIS, A TREND WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE INTO THE EARLY                  
MORNING HOURS. GIVEN THE TRAPPED NATURE OF THE MOISTURE IN THE                  
BOUNDARY LAYER, AS IS USUALLY THE CASE, IT WILL REQUIRE AN AIR MASS             
CHANGE TO CLEAR OUT THE SKY OVER OUR AREA. THIS WILL OCCUR AS THE               
SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS TOWARD THE NORTH AND EAST AND LOW LEVEL FLOW               
TURNS MORE TOWARD THE SOUTH. THE CHANGE IN WIND DIRECTION, ALONG                
WITH THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE SURFACE RIDGE, WILL SERVE AS A                
GOOD TRACER FOR THE CLEARING TREND IN THE STRATUS LATE IN THE                   
OVERNIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. MVFR CEILING WILL THEN BECOME

SHORT TERM...THROUGH TONIGHT                                                    
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT AND               
EXTEND UP INTO THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES. THIS WILL BRING DRY WEATHER            
AND ALLOW WINDS TO RELAX.                                                       
MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGE FOR THE SHORT TERM REMAINS CENTERED AROUND              
THE POSSIBLE BREAK-UP OF THE STRATUS DECK ENTRENCHED OVER THE                   
REGION. WESTERLY FLOW OFF LAKE MICHIGAN HAS HELPED KEEP THIS DECK               
INTACT THIS AFTERNOON. 12Z DTX SOUNDING INDICATES THE MIXED LAYER TO            
BE POTENTIALLY 5000 FEET DEEP...BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS                
LAYER SHRINKING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS INVERSION HEIGHTS LOWER.               
FORECAST SOUNDINGS ALSO SHOW THE AIRMASS REMAINING FAIRLY SATURATED             
IN THE LOWER LEVELS THROUGH MUCH OF THE AFTERNOON...BEFORE SOME                 
DRIER AIR IS MIXED DOWN DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON. MODELS LOOK TOO              
AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS MIXING AS THEY ARE TOO WARM WITH SURFACE                   
TEMPERATURES AND AT LEAST 1000 FEET TOO LOW WITH THE INVERSION                  
HEIGHTS (WHERE DRIER AIR RESIDES ABOVE). THINK THE LOWER LAYERS WILL            
STAY A LITTLE MORE MOIST THAN INDICATED...FAVORING A MORE INTACT                
DECK.                                                                           
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A SMALL UPPER SHORTWAVE TRACKING UP                   
THROUGH ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. NAM AND RUC MODELS HAVE THE BEST                  
HANDLE ON THIS FEATURE...BUT LARGELY SHEAR IT OUT BEFORE IT REACHES             
THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE MICHIGAN/OHIO BORDER BY 00Z. UPSTREAM                
OVER ILLINOIS...THIS FEATURE HAS HELPED CLEAR OUT MOST OF THE                   
STRATUS. HOWEVER...NOT SURE IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK UP THE            
DECK OVER THE SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA.                                           
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THIS INFORMATION...WILL KEEP THE DECK                   
LARGELY INTACT FOR THE AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE. EXPECTING A FEW              
BREAKS TO APPEAR DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING HOWEVER.               
CIRRUS SHIELD WILL EXPAND OVERNIGHT FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE             
OHIO VALLEY AS THE BROAD UPPER TROUGH CROSSING THE ROCKIES BECOMES              
MORE AMPLIFIED. HIGH CLOUDS WILL START TO SPREAD INTO THE SOUTHERN              
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE EARLY MORNING...THROUGH THEY               
WILL ARRIVE TOO LATE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON TEMPERATURES. OVERNIGHT            
LOWS WILL RUN 8 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW LAST NIGHT`S MILD

THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND INDUCES COASTAL ATLANTIC CYCLOGENESIS.                 
TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY WILL REBOUND SLIGHTLY FROM TODAY...AS THE                
GRADIENT TAKES ON MORE OF A SOUTHERLY COMPONENT AND THINNER                     
HIGH/MID CLOUDS CONTROL THE SKY CONDITION. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)                                              
WV IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS INDICATED A BROAD TROUGH OVER THE CONUS             
WITH THE STRONGEST JET ENERGY WELL TO THE SOUTH. A WEAK SHORTWAVE               
TROUGH OVER NRN WI WAS SHEARING OUT AS IT MOVES INTO MORE CONFLUENT             
FLOR FROM THE GREAT LAKES INTO ERN CANADA. WEAK 275K-280K ISENTROPIC            
LIFT FROM NW WI TOWARD W UPPER MI SUPPORTED SOME LIGHT SNOW OR                  
FLURRIES FROM ERN MN INTO NW WI. RADAR REFLECTIVITIES...PER KDLH                
RADAR...WERE MAINLY 10 DBZ OR LESS. LIGHT LAKE EFFECT SNOW SHOWERS              
ALSO CONTINUED INTO THE KEWEENAW AND NE CWA WITH WEAK 10-20 KT WRLY             
CBL FLOW. OTHERWISE...CLOUD SKIES PREVAILED ACROSS ALL BUT THE FAR              
SOUTH CWA.                                                                      
TONIGHT...EXPECT THE AREA OF WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT WITH LIGHT SNOW OR            
FLURRIES TO CONTINUE MOVING NE. SO...SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WERE                    
INCLUDED THIS EVENING TIL THE SHORTWAVE LIFTS NE OF THE AREA. THE               
NAM AND LCL HIGH RES WRF/ARW SUGGEST THAT THE WEAK WEST WINDS WILL              
ALLOW A LAKE INDUCED TROF TO DEVELOP FROM WRN LAKE SUPERIOR ACROSS              
THE KEWEENAW. LOW LEVEL CONV WITH THIS FEATURE COULD PROVIDE A FOCUS            
FOR ENHANCED LES AS 850 MB TEMPS AROUND -12C (LAKE-H8 DELTA TO TO               
AROUND 15C) AND INVERSION HEIGHTS ABOVE 7K FT(MOISTURE TO AT LEAST              
10K FT) WILL FAVOR POTENTIAL FOR LIGHT TO MODERATE LES.                         
HOWEVER...SINCE UNCERTAINTY REMAINS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT...PLACEMENT            
AND MOVEMENT OF THE TROUGH...SNOWFALL AMOUNTS IN THE 1-3 INCH RANGE             
WERE MENTIONED. HOWEVER...IF A STRONGER BAND DEVELOPS SEVERAL MORE              
INCHES WOULD BE EXPECTED.                                                       
SUNDAY...ANY LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD LIFT NORTHEAST AS MORE SW            
LARGE SCALE FLOW TAKES OVER. OTHERWISE...LOW LEVEL WAA WITH MOISTURE            
BENEATH A STRENGTHENING INVERSION SHOULD KEEP STRATUS IN PLACE.                 
CANNOT RULE OUT A FEW FLURRIES BUT WOULD BE ISOLD/BRIEF. MOISTURE TO            
-10C AND INCREASING SFC DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS SHOULD MINIMIZE ANY                
FZDZ POTENTIAL.                                                                 
.LONG TERM (SUN NIGHT THRU SAT)...                                              
SUN NIGHT THRU TUE...TROF OVER THE CNTRL INTO THE ERN CONUS WILL                
BEGIN TO SHARPEN DUE TO UPSTREAM RIDGE BUILDING ALONG THE W COAST. A            
COUPLE OF STRONGER SHORTWAVES WILL AFFECT THE GREAT LAKES (FIRST MON            
AND SECOND TUE)...BUT IT APPEARS THE BULK OF THE FORCING WITH EACH              
WILL PASS S OF THE FCST AREA. AT THE SFC...BROAD LOW PRES OVER THE              
NRN PLAINS SUN NIGHT WILL MOVE TO THE LWR LAKES BY TUE MORNING AND              
GRADUALLY BECOME MORE WELL DEFINED AS SECOND SHORTWAVE SWINGS INTO              
THE GREAT LAKES. WHILE THERE IS STILL SOME POTENTIAL OF S TO SW FLOW            
LES/LAKE ENHANCED SNOW TO AFFECT THE FAR ERN FCST AREA AHEAD OF LOW             
PRES...MANY OF THE MODELS ARE TRENDING AWAY FROM SRLY FLOW INTO                 
UPPER MI SINCE LOW IS INITIALLY BROAD/POORLY DEFINED. UNTIL MODEL               
AGREEMENT BECOMES BETTER...WILL STAY ALONG THE LINES OF PREVIOUS                
FCSTS WHICH HAVE SHOWN SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS OVER THE FAR ERN FCST               
AREA SUN NIGHT/MON TO COVER THE POTENTIAL. ELSEWHERE...THERE IS                 
NOTHING SIGNIFICANT TO TIE PCPN CHANCES TO SUN NIGHT/MON. SINCE THE             
FCST AREA IS JUST AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING MAIN MIDLEVEL TROF                   
AXIS...BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS PROBABLY TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH            
PREVIOUS FCST (LOW CHC POPS ACROSS THE BOARD). SECOND SHORTWAVE                 
PASSING THRU THE GREAT LAKES MON NIGHT/TUE WILL OFFER A BETTER                  
OPPORTUNITY FOR SHSN ACROSS THE FCST AREA. IT WILL ALSO GET LES                 
GOING. IN RESPONSE TO THE SHORTWAVE...A SHARP SFC TROF WILL                     
DROP ACROSS LAKE SUPERIOR INTO UPPER MI LATE MON NIGHT/TUE                      
MORNING...TRIGGERING A PERIOD OF MDT TO POSSIBLY HVY LAKE ENHANCED              
SNOW FOR PROBABLY ALL AREAS NEAR THE LAKE AS WINDS SHIFT NRLY. PURE             
LES REGIME WILL THEN DEVELOP DURING THE DAY TUE INTO TUE NIGHT AS               
THE SHORTWAVE MOVES AWAY FROM THE AREA. LES WILL ALSO SHIFT AS NRLY             
WINDS TUE BACK NW TUE NIGHT. EXPECT THE LATE MON NIGHT/TUE PERIOD TO            
BE A HEADLINE EVENT FOR MOST IF NOT ALL THE COUNTIES BORDERING LAKE             
SUPERIOR. IT WILL CERTAINLY BE AN ADVY. WHETHER OR NOT WARNING                  
AMOUNTS CAN BE REACHED WILL DEPEND ON HOW SIGNIFICANT THE LAKE                  
ENHANCED PORTION OF THE EVENT WILL BE...AND THAT WON`T BE KNOWN                 
UNTIL THE EVENT GETS CLOSER IN TIME. AT THE MOMENT...IT LOOKS LIKE              
AN ADVY WILL COVER IT.                                                          
WED THRU SAT...BIG CHANGE IN THE PATTERN WILL OCCUR DURING THIS                 
PERIOD AS ERN CONUS TROF SHIFTS TO THE WRN ATLANTIC...WRN NAMERICA              
RIDGE BROADENS AND SHIFTS EWD...AND TROFFING DEVELOPS JUST OFF THE W            
COAST. LATEST GFS/ECMWF RUNS CONTINUE TO SHOW VERY GOOD CONTINUITY              
WITH PREVIOUS RUNS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS...SUGGESTING A STRONG             
SIGNAL IS THERE FOR THIS CHANGE IN THE PATTERN. NEAR/SLIGHTLY BLO               
NORMAL TEMPS TUE/WED ASSOCIATED WITH TROF WILL TREND ABOVE NORMAL               
FOR FRI/SAT WITH WARM REGIME CONTINUING BEYOND THIS FCST PERIOD INTO            
AT LEAST EARLY NEXT WEEK. EXPECT THE BIGGEST IMPACT OF WARMING ON               
MIN TEMPS WHICH WILL LIKELY HAVE INCREASINGLY GREATER DEPARTURES                
FROM NORMAL THAN MAX TEMPS AS THE WARMING TREND LENGTHENS. WOULD NOT            
BE SURPRISED TO SEE TEMPS STRUGGLE TO FALL BACK BLO FREEZING AT                 
NIGHT AT SOME POINT OVER THE WEEKEND/EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR PCPN...            
LES WILL WIND DOWN WED AND SHOULD END WED NIGHT FROM W TO E AS SFC              
RIDGE PASSES AND WAA GETS UNDERWAY. GFS SUGGESTS ONE LAST SHORTWAVE             
WILL DROP SE TOWARD THE DEPARTING LONGWAVE TROF THU/FRI. ECMWF                  
INDICATES THIS SHORTWAVE WILL PASS MUCH FARTHER TO THE N THAN THE               
GFS. SINCE THE GFS ENSEMBLES LEND SUPPORT FOR AN ECMWF TYPE                     
SOLUTION...WILL LEAN STRONGLY TOWARD ITS SOLUTION FROM THU ONWARD.              
NICE TO SEE THAT THE 12Z GFS TRENDED TOWARD THE PREFERRED ECMWF                 
SOLUTION. ALTHOUGH AIRMASS LOOKS QUITE DRY...STRONG WAA (850MB WINDS            
TO 50KT) SUGGESTS MAINTAINING CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS FCST OF LOW              
POPS FOR -SN THU. FIRST SHORTWAVE HEADING E FROM THE NEW TROF JUST              
OFF THE W COAST SHOULD MAKE A RUN ACROSS THE PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT            
LAKES SAT...BRINGING THE POSSIBILITY OF LIGHT RAIN AND/OR SNOW. AT              
LEAST ONE PREDOMINANT RAIN EVENT SEEMS LIKELY DURING THE UPCOMING               
PERIOD OF WELL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.            
&&

TONIGHT WITH DECENT UPSTREAM SFC-700 MB MOISTURE AND ONSHORE WRLY               
FLOW. AS THE WIND SWINGS AROUND TO THE SW LATE TONIGHT...LAKE EFFECT            
SHOULD SHUT OFF...BUT CLOUDS WILL HANG ON THROUGH SUNDAY THERE. SW              
TO W WINDS AT KSAW SHOULD LIMIT ANY LES CHANCES. HOWEVER... THE HIGH            
MVFR CLOUD DECK WILL LINGER AS MODEL FCST SOUNDINGS SHOW AN                     
INVERSION PERSISTING AT 3500 FT.

.MARINE (FOR THE 4 PM LAKE SUPERIOR FORECAST ISSUANCE)...                       
EVEN THOUGH WINDS WILL GENERALLY BE LIGHT TONIGHT WITH A WEAK TROUGH            
IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER LAKE SUPERIOR TONIGHT WITH THE POTENTIAL            
FOR SOMEWHAT STRONGER WSW WINDS JUST SOUTH OF THE TROUGH AXIS.                  
OTHERWISE WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE SLIDING EAST OF THE REGION WINDS              
WILL REMAIN BLO 25 KNOTS. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TAKING SHAPE IN THE             
NORTHERN PLAINS WILL MOVE INTO THE UPPER GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY. A               
TIGHT NRLY GRADIENT WILL DEVELOP ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW ON TUE              
AS STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE PLAINS. FOR NOW...LEFT IN               
WINDS TO 30 KT WHICH MAY NEED TO BE RAISED TO GALES AS CONFIDENCE IN            
THE SURFACE PRESSURE FIELD INCREASES. LOOK FOR WINDS TO DIMINISH TO

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT AND               
EXTEND UP INTO THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES. THIS WILL BRING DRY WEATHER            
AND ALLOW WINDS TO RELAX.                                                       
MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGE FOR THE SHORT TERM REMAINS CENTERED AROUND              
THE POSSIBLE BREAK-UP OF THE STRATUS DECK ENTRENCHED OVER THE                   
REGION. WESTERLY FLOW OFF LAKE MICHIGAN HAS HELPED KEEP THIS DECK               
INTACT THIS AFTERNOON. 12Z DTX SOUNDING INDICATES THE MIXED LAYER TO            
BE POTENTIALLY 5000 FEET DEEP...BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS                
LAYER SHRINKING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS INVERSION HEIGHTS LOWER.               
FORECAST SOUNDINGS ALSO SHOW THE AIRMASS REMAINING FAIRLY SATURATED             
IN THE LOWER LEVELS THROUGH MUCH OF THE AFTERNOON...BEFORE SOME                 
DRIER AIR IS MIXED DOWN DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON. MODELS LOOK TOO              
AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS MIXING AS THEY ARE TOO WARM WITH SURFACE                   
TEMPERATURES AND AT LEAST 1000 FEET TOO LOW WITH THE INVERSION                  
HEIGHTS (WHERE DRIER AIR RESIDES ABOVE). THINK THE LOWER LAYERS WILL            
STAY A LITTLE MORE MOIST THAN INDICATED...FAVORING A MORE INTACT

THROUGH ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. NAM AND RUC MODELS HAVE THE BEST                  
HANDLE ON THIS FEATURE...BUT LARGELY SHEAR IT OUT BEFORE IT REACHES             
THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE MICHIGAN/OHIO BORDER BY 00Z. UPSTREAM                
OVER ILLINOIS...THIS FEATURE HAS HELPED CLEAR OUT MOST OF THE                   
STRATUS. HOWEVER...NOT SURE IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK UP THE            
DECK OVER THE SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA.                                           
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THIS INFORMATION...WILL KEEP THE DECK                   
LARGELY INTACT FOR THE AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE. EXPECTING A FEW              
BREAKS TO APPEAR DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING HOWEVER.               
CIRRUS SHIELD WILL EXPAND OVERNIGHT FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE             
OHIO VALLEY AS THE BROAD UPPER TROUGH CROSSING THE ROCKIES BECOMES              
MORE AMPLIFIED. HIGH CLOUDS WILL START TO SPREAD INTO THE SOUTHERN              
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE EARLY MORNING...THROUGH THEY               
WILL ARRIVE TOO LATE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON TEMPERATURES. OVERNIGHT

THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND INDUCES COASTAL ATLANTIC CYCLOGENESIS.                 
TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY WILL REBOUND SLIGHTLY FROM TODAY...AS THE                
GRADIENT TAKES ON MORE OF A SOUTHERLY COMPONENT AND THINNER                     
HIGH/MID CLOUDS CONTROL THE SKY CONDITION. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS                 
HINT AT SECONDARY WEAK SFC LOW DEVELOPMENT WEST OF THE                          
APPALACHIANS... ALLOWING FOR A NARROW AREA OF LGT PCPN TO DEVELOP               
ALONG THE DEFORMATION AXIS LIFTING NORTHEAST FROM SOUTHWEST OHIO                
THROUGH LAKE ERIE SUNDAY EVENING. THE VERY NORTHWEST EDGE OF THIS               
MAY CLIP EXTREME SOUTHEAST LOWER MI...AND WILL JUST INTRODUCE A                 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP THROUGH 06Z FROM MONROE TO MACOMB COUNTY FOR                  
VERY LGT SNOW SHOWERS WITH NO ACCUMS EXPECTED. OTHERWISE...WILL                 
BACK OFF ON POPS FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD...AS MODEL CONSENSUS                  
REMAINS SUFFICIENT THAT IMPACTS FROM THE NEXT APPROACHING SYSTEM

THIS SYSTEM BECOMES THE MAIN FOCUS FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE...                 
LIKELY IMPACTING MUCH OF SOUTHEAST LOWER MICHIGAN LATE ON NEW YEARS

STRENGTHENING SLIGHTLY AND INDUCING SFC LOW DEVELOPMENT AS IT MOVES             
INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS/GREAT LAKES THROUGH EARLY MONDAY.  IN                  
RESPONSE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN RESOLVING SUCH A LOW AMPLITUDE WAVE               
BEFORE IT CAN BE PROPERLY SAMPLED...THE MODELS CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE             
WITH THE FINER DETAILS WITH THIS SYSTEM...WITH THE BIGGEST STRUGGLES            
INVOLVING WHERE TO PLACE THE BEST FORCING AND ASSOCIATED MAIN

ALL MODELS AGREE ON TAKING THE SFC LOW FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS                 
NORTHERN/CENTRAL LOWER MI.  HOWEVER...THE NAM (WITH SUPPORT FROM                
SREF OUTPUT) MAINTAINS A MUCH MORE COMPACT SYSTEM...AND FOCUSES THE             
BULK OF THE PCPN FROM THE SAGINAW VALLEY NORTHWARD.  MEANWHILE...THE            
GFS INDICATES A MUCH BROADER SYSTEM...WITH A HIGHER AXIS OF QPF                 
(.1-.2") SOUTH OF THE SFC LOW FOCUSED ALONG THE FRONTAL CONVERGENCE             
ZONE AND WITHIN AN AREA OF ENHANCED FORCING PROVIDED BY THE                     
SHORTWAVE.  THE ECMWF SHOWS A SIMILAR DEPICTION...ONLY WITH MUCH                
LESS QPF IN A SHORTER DURATION.  GIVEN THE POOR CONSENSUS...WILL                
GENERALLY TAKE A BLEND...ADJUSTING PCPN AMOUNTS UP SLIGHTLY ACROSS              
THE SOUTH BUT UNDERCUTTING THE HIGHER AMOUNTS SHOWN BY THE GFS.                 
THIS WILL MAKE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FROM A DUSTING TO 2 INCHES                    
POSSIBLE AREAWIDE MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR             
NARROW CORRIDOR OF HIGHER END AMOUNTS UP TO 3 INCHES SOMEWHERE                  
WITHIN THE CWA.

SOUTHERN LK MICHIGAN. 250MB JET CORE OVR IL INTO LWR MI SO SHORTWAVE            
SHOULD CONTINUE TO LIFT INTO LWR MI INSTEAD OF COME ANY FURTHER TO              
THE NORTH. SFC REFLECTION WITH THE WAVE IS LOW PRESSURE NEAR 1010MB             
IN THE VCNTY OF CHICAGO. UPR LEVEL FEATURES AND DEEP MOISTURE INFLOW            
ARE MAIN INSTIGATORS FOR BROAD SWATH OF SNOW FM EASTERN WI TO SOUTH             
CENTRAL UPR MI AND INTO WESTERN LWR MI. THUS FAR HEAVIEST SNOW WITH             
RATES OF 1-2"/HR ARE ALLIGNED FM CNTRL LK MI INTO NRN LWR MI. AS H85            
LOW PASSES FM NORTHERN IL INTO NE LWR MI BY THIS EVENING AXIS OF                
HEAVIEST SNOW SHOULD MISS THE CWA. LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOW WILL                  
AFFECT THE CWA...WITH THE HEAVIEST FALLING CLOSEST TO THE TRACK OF              
H85 LOW...BASICALLY ALONG THE LAKE MICHIGAN SHORELINE.                          
ENE WINDS FLOWING OFF NORTHERN LK MICHIGAN AND 850MB TEMPS AROUND               
-10C MAY SETUP LAKE ENHANCED SNOW OVER NORTHERN PORTIONS OF                     
MENOMINEE AND SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF DELTA THIS EVENING. WINDS BACK              
QUICKLY TO THE NORTH BY LATE EVENING SO ALTHOUGH LOCALIZED AMOUNTS              
TO 6" ARE POSSIBLE ELECT TO NOT UPGRADE TO A WARNING SINCE MOST OF              
THE AREA WILL ONLY SEE ADVY LEVEL SNOW AMOUNTS.                                 
MEANWHILE...LARGE SCALE LIFT AND ADEQUATE OVER WATER INSTABILITY                
COULD PRODUCE SOME LAKE ENHANCEMENT OFF LAKE SUPERIOR TONIGHT.                  
INITIALLY...NORTHERN PORTIONS OF KEWEENAW ARE FAVORED AS WINDS                  
THROUGH H85 ARE FM THE ENE. HIGHER TERRAIN OF NORTH CENTRAL AND

03Z-09Z AND H85 COLD AIR ADVECTION WITH TEMPS LOWERING TO -12C

AS FAR AS OUR GOING HEADLINES ARE CONCERNED...SEE NO NEED TO CHANGE             
THEM ATTM. HEAVIST SYNOPTIC SNOW IS JUST GOING TO GRAZE LK MICHIGAN             
ZONES SO THE ADVY LOOKS FINE FOR THOSE AREAS AND ANY ENHANCEMENT OFF            
LK SUPERIOR WILL BE LOCALIZED AND FAIRLY BRIEF. LIKELY SNOW SHOWERS             
SHOULD CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY NEAR LK SUPERIOR...ALTHOUGH DRY AIR               
SHOWING UP BLO H9 IN SOUNDINGS AND MINIMAL LIFT IN THE CLOUD LAYER              
WILL LIMIT ADDITIONAL ACCUMS.                                                   
.LONG TERM (SAT NIGHT THRU FRI)...                                              
SAT NIGHT...850MB TEMPS OF -12 TO -13C WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR SOME              
LES. INTERESTING ASPECT WILL BE THE LOW-LEVEL WIND FIELDS.                      
GFS/NAM/REGIONAL CANADIAN ALL SHOW A CONVERGENCE ZONE SETTING UP W              
TO E OVER LAKE SUPERIOR...INITIALLY EXTENDING ACROSS THE KEWEENAW IN            
THE EVENING. GFS AND REGIONAL CANADIAN SHOW THIS ZONE SHIFTING N                
DURING THE NIGHT WHILE THE NAM LINGERS IT ACROSS THE NRN PART OF THE            
KEWEENAW. SINCE THE CANADIAN MODEL TYPICALLY DOES WELL WITH WINDS               
OVER LAKE SUPERIOR AND IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE GFS AND UKMET AS                  
WELL...WILL DISREGARD THE NAM SOLUTION. WITH DEEP MOISTURE UPWARDS              
OF 7KFT...THERE COULD BE A FEW INCHES OF ACCUMULATION ACROSS THE                
KEWEENAW BEFORE CONVERGENCE ZONE SHIFTS N. WILL ALSO INCLUDE CHC                
POPS E OF MUNISING IN THE EVENING BEFORE WINDS BACK SW. ELSEWHERE...            
EXPECT DRY WEATHER SAT NIGHT.                                                   
SUN/MON...TROF OVER THE CNTRL CONUS WILL BEGIN TO SHARPEN DUE TO                
UPSTREAM RIDGE BUILDING ALONG THE W COAST. A COUPLE OF SHORTWAVES               
WILL AFFECT THE UPPER LAKES...BUT NOTHING APPEARS WELL DEFINED AT               
THE MOMENT. WITH THE LACK OF FOCUSED FORCING...PCPN SHOULD GENERALLY            
BE ON LIGHT SIDE WHEN IT OCCURS. WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY CHC POPS                
SUN/MON DUE TO UNCERTAIN TIMING OF SHORTWAVES...BUT WILL UP POPS                
SOME ON MON DUE TO REASONABLE AGREEMENT ON SFC LOW AND STRONGER                 
SHORTWAVE IN THE VCNTY AT THAT TIME. IF WINDS TAKE ON ENOUGH SRLY               
COMPONENT AHEAD OF LOW...SOME LAKE ENHANCED SNOW OFF LAKE MICHIGAN              
WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE FAR ERN FCST AREA SUN/MON. HAVE GENERALLY             
CARRIED HIGHEST POPS IN THAT AREA TO COVER THE POTENTIAL.                       
TUE THRU FRI...THE BEGINNING OF A BIG SWING IN THE PATTERN IS                   
EXPECTED DURING THIS PERIOD AS CNTRL/ERN CONUS TROF SHIFTS TO THE               
WRN ATLANTIC AND RIDGE ALONG THE W COAST BROADENS AND SHIFTS EWD.               
DESPITE WELL OUT INTO THE MODEL RUNS...THE GFS/ECMWF HAVE SHOWN VERY            
GOOD CONTINUITY ON THIS CHANGE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS...                    
SUGGESTING A STRONG SIGNAL IS THERE. NEAR/SLIGHTLY BLO NORMAL TEMPS             
TUE/WED ASSOCIATED WITH TROF WILL TREND ABOVE NORMAL BY FRI WITH                
WARMING ONLY STRENGTHENING BEYOND THIS FCST PERIOD THRU NEXT                    
WEEKEND. GIVEN VERY LOW SUN ANGLE THIS TIME OF YEAR...WARMING THAT              
OCCURS ALOFT WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE COMPLETELY REALIZED AT THE                   
SFC...ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE WARMING TREND WHICH COVERS THIS PERIOD            
OF THE FCST. BIGGEST IMPACT WILL BE ON MIN TEMPS WHICH WILL HAVE                
INCREASINGLY GREATER DEPARTURES FROM NORMAL THAN HIGH TEMPS AS THE              
WARMING TREND LENGTHENS. AS FOR PCPN...EXPECT DECENT LES TUE INTO               
EARLY WED... ESPECIALLY TUE AS GFS/ECMWF SHOW A SHORTWAVE DROPPING              
THRU THE AREA. COULD SEE A PERIOD OF HVY SNOW AS THAT SHORTWAVE                 
PASSES. WIND FLOW WILL GENERALLY BE NW THOUGH IT SHOULD GO NRLY FOR             
A TIME WITH TUE SHORTWAVE PASSAGE...SO ALL AREAS NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR             
WILL GET IN ON ACCUMULATING LES. LES WILL BEGIN TO WIND DOWN WED AND            
SHOULD END WED NIGHT FROM W TO E AS SFC RIDGE PASSES AND WAA GETS               
UNDERWAY. THERE MAY BE SOME -SN THU/FRI DURING STRONG WAA. OPTED TO             
MAINTAIN PREVIOUS FCST OF LOW POPS ON THU FOR THIS POTENTIAL.                   
CARRIED A DRY FCST FOR FRI...BUT WOULDN`T BE SURPRISED IF LOW POPS

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY                                              
DESPITE NO MAJOR STORMS..THE FORECAST IS RATHER COMPLICATED                     
FORECAST FOR THE FIRST 36 HOURS OF THIS CYCLE WITH SEVERAL LOW-                 
AMPLITUDE DISTURBANCES TO AFFECT THE DLH CWA.                                   
FIRST ITEM OF CONCERN IS THE WNW-ESE ORIENTED BAND OF LIGHT SNOW                
THAT HAS BEEN SLOWLY TRANSLATING NEWD ACROSS NE MN AND WRN LK                   
SUPERIOR FOR THE LAST 18 HOURS. RADAR RETURNS FROM KDLH HAVE                    
DIMINISHED SOMEWHAT IN THE PAST HOUR..BUT STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT                 
THIS IS DUE TO SAMPLING CONSIDERATIONS AS THE FORCING FOR THIS                  
BAND OF SNOW APPEARS TO BE TIED TO WARM ADVECTION AND                           
FRONTOGENESIS IN A RATHER SHALLOW LAYER WITHIN ABOUT 6 KFT AGL. AS              
THE BAND CONTINUES TO MOVE NEWD..THE BEAM IS LIKELY OVERSHOOTING                
MOST OF THE ECHOES. THE NAM/RUC SEEM TO PICK UP ON THIS MESOSCALE               
FEATURE RATHER WELL IN THE MASS FIELDS..AND BOTH LINGER DECENT                  
FORCING OVER THE MN ARROWHEAD THRU ABOUT MIDDAY..SO HAVE KEPT                   
LIKELY POPS FOR UP TO AN INCH OR SO OF ACCUM IN THIS AREA. NORTH                
SHORE TERRAIN RIDGE WILL ALSO EXPERIENCE A PERIOD OF SE FLOW THIS               
AFTERNOON/EVENING WHICH MAY ACT TO LOCALLY ENHANCE SNOW IN FAVORED              
AREAS.                                                                          
NEXT ISSUE IS THE COMPACT VORT MAX CLEARLY EVIDENT IN WV SAT                    
IMAGERY OVER FAR NE ND. THIS VORT MAX IS PROGGED TO TRANSLATE EWD               
TODAY/TONIGHT ALONG THE CANADIAN BORDER..AND EXPECT LIGHT SNOW TO               
CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN COVERAGE /PER CURRENT OBS FROM KMVX RADAR/                
ACROSS NRN MN AS THIS IMPULSE INTERACTS WITH NWD RETREATING                     
BAROCLINIC ZONE. ALL SAID..AN INCH OR TWO OF SNOW APPEARS POSSIBLE

FINALLY..STRONGER MID/UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION WILL DROP SEWD FROM               
MANITOBA ON MONDAY..AND SHUD SPREAD ANOTHER ROUND OF LIGHT SNOW                 
ACROSS MUCH OF NRN MN AND NW WI BEGINNING MONDAY AFTERNOON. HAVE                
ALSO MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPS TO REFLECT A SMALLER DROP                   
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AS CLOUDS PERSIST..WITH WINDS FINALLY SHIFTING                
TO THE W/NW OUT WEST MONDAY AFTERNOON WHICH SHUD ALLOW SOME COLDER              
AIR TO FILTER IN. CANNOT RULE OUT SOME LIGHT SNOW OR FREEZING                   
DRIZZLE ACROSS SRN SECTIONS OF THE DLH CWA..BUT CONFIDENCE IN                   
MEASURABLE PRECIP IN THIS AREA IS VERY LOW ATTM..SO HAVE CONFINED

DOMINATE THE CONUS DURING MID TO LATE WEEK. THIS WILL OVERALL                   
SIGNAL AN END TO THE RATHER ACTIVE PATTERN THAT WE HAVE

MORE APART FROM EACH OTHER. HOWEVER THRU MONDAY...LOOK FOR SEVERAL              
SYSTEMS TO IMPACT THE AREA...OR AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO.                            
SYSTEM NUMBER ONE IS A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROF JUST W OF THE FA ATTM                
AND WILL PUSH THRU THE AREA TODAY. SYSTEM OVERALL IS MOISTURE                   
LACKING...ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWER LEVELS. MAIN IMPACT FROM THIS                 
WILL BE A DECK OF MID CLOUDS THAT WILL PUSH OFF TO THE E THIS                   
MORNING WITH NO PCPN EXPECTED...ALTHOUGH A STRAY FLURRY OR TWO IS               
NOT TOTALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR AREAS S AND E OF KSTL EARLY                 
THIS MORNING. LOOK FOR TEMPERATURES TO BE A BIT MILDER THAN                     
YESTERDAY...AND DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MOS TEMPS...ALTHOUGH                
TRIMMED A DEG OR TWO IN THE NWRN FA FOR SNOW PACK THAT STILL

SYSTEM NUMBER TWO IS ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROF THAT WILL SWING THRU                
THE NRN FA AT FIRST LATE TONIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING...BUT THEN                  
DROP SEWD THRU THE FA DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY ON MONDAY.                
THIS WILL ALSO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONG SFC CDFNT. LIKE SYSTEM                
NUMBER ONE...THIS ONE WILL ALSO BE RATHER MOISTURE CHALLENGED WITH              
PWATS COMPARABLE TO THE OTHER SYSTEM OF JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE                     
SEASONAL NORMALS. FORCING WILL BE STRONGER WITH THIS SYSTEM                     
HOWEVER...AND IS STILL WORTHY OF A LOW CHANCE POP AT THIS TIME.                 
CONFINED THE BETTER PCPN PROBS TO THE NRN FA WHERE THE DEEPER                   
MOISTURE WILL BE AND LESS LOWER LEVEL DRY AIR TO OVERCOME. REDUCED              
POPS ELSEWHERE TO SLIGHT CHANCE...BUT ALSO HAVE SPRINKLES/FLURRIES              
IN AS WELL TO ACCOUNT FOR VERY LIGHT PCPN POTENTIAL WHICH IS MORE               
LIKELY OUTCOME AT THIS TIME.

SINGLE DIGIT LOWS LIKELY ON WEDNESDAY MORNING FOR A DECENT PORTION

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS SHIFTING ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING IN            
THE WAKE OF THIS MORNINGS UPPER LOW THAT FORCED SOME LIGHT RAIN AND             
SNOW IN MOST AREAS.  SOME LINGERING STRATUS WAS LIMITING                        
TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING INTO THE TEENS ALONG THE OZARK PLATEAU.               
THIS STRATUS WILL LIKELY BURN OFF QUICKLY UPON SUNRISE THIS                     
MORNING.                                                                        
MEANWHILE...ANOTHER UPPER DISTURBANCE WILL APPROACH FROM                        
THE WEST LATE TONIGHT.  A MOISTURE STARVED ATMOSPHERE WILL KEEP                 
CONDITIONS DRY THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF THIS SYSTEM.  HOWEVER...I CAN             
NOT RULE OUT SOME PRECIP CHANCES FOR MONDAY AS A SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR            
RUSHES INTO THE REGION.  THIS CHANGE IN AIRMASS WAS THE MAIN                    
FORECAST CHALLENGE IN THIS MORNINGS ANALYSIS AS SINGLE DIGIT                    
READINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY MID WEEK.                                          
SHORT TERM (TODAY - TUESDAY NIGHT)...                                           
RUC 275K POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE SURFACE EXPLAINS WHY STRATUS IS                  
LINGERING ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE I-44 CORRIDOR.  A TROUGH AXIS                  
APPEARS TO BE STATIONARY NEAR THIS CORRIDOR...AND WEAK FLOW ACROSS              
THE AXIS IS PROVIDING A WEAK BAND OF LIFT IN THE FORM OF PRESSURE               
ADVECTION.  AFTER SUNRISE...THE LOWER TROP WILL BEGIN TO MIX OUT                
WHICH WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE THIS LOW LEVEL ZONE OF COLDER AIR.                  
UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ALONG WITH A RETURN OF SOUTHERLY                       
WINDS...TEMPERATURES WILL WARM INTO THE 40S THIS AFTERNOON.                     
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE REGION LATE TONIGHT.  DESPITE              
MODERATE FORCING IN ADVANCE OF THIS WAVE...PRESSURE CONDENSATION                
LEVELS ARE SO HIGH AND CAN NOT BE REALIZED DUE TO A VERY DRY                    
AIRMASS.  00Z SOUNDINGS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS                  
MEASURED PWATS LESS THAN ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH.  THEREFORE ONLY SOME           
MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS WILL RESULT FROM THE PASSAGE OF THIS                 
DISTURBANCE.                                                                    
SOUTHERLY WINDS AT THE SURFACE AND CLEAR SKIES WILL BOOST                       
TEMPERATURES UP A FEW MORE DEGREES FROM TODAYS EXPECTED READINGS.               
AS A MATTER OF FACT...I INCREASED TEMPERATURES IN MOST LOCATIONS A              
FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN MAV GUIDANCE.  PROGGED SURFACE TO 850                   
THICKNESSES CORRELATES WITH TEMPERATURES APPROACHING THE LOWER 50S              
ON SUNDAY.  AGAIN...NO PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE REST OF            
THE WEEKEND.                                                                    
ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND SHOW GOOD RUN TO              
RUN CONSISTENCY WITH A SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR DURING THE DAY ON                    
MONDAY.  TEMPERATURES AT THIS POINT WILL EXPERIENCE A COOLING TREND

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS SHIFTING ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING IN            
THE WAKE OF THIS MORNINGS UPPER LOW THAT FORCED SOME LIGHT RAIN AND             
SNOW IN MOST AREAS.  SOME LINGERING STRATUS WAS LIMITING                        
TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING INTO THE TEENS ALONG THE OZARK PLATEAU.               
THIS STRATUS WILL LIKELY BURN OFF QUICKLY UPON SUNRISE THIS                     
MORNING.                                                                        
MEANWHILE...ANOTHER UPPER DISTURBANCE WILL APPROACH FROM                        
THE WEST LATE TONIGHT.  A MOISTURE STARVED ATMOSPHERE WILL KEEP                 
CONDITIONS DRY THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF THIS SYSTEM.  HOWEVER...I CAN             
NOT RULE OUT SOME PRECIP CHANCES FOR MONDAY AS A SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR            
RUSHES INTO THE REGION.  THIS CHANGE IN AIRMASS WAS THE MAIN                    
FORECAST CHALLENGE IN THIS MORNINGS ANALYSIS AS SINGLE DIGIT                    
READINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY MID WEEK.

RUC 275K POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE SURFACE EXPLAINS WHY STRATUS IS                  
LINGERING ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE I-44 CORRIDOR.  A TROUGH AXIS                  
APPEARS TO BE STATIONARY NEAR THIS CORRIDOR...AND WEAK FLOW ACROSS              
THE AXIS IS PROVIDING A WEAK BAND OF LIFT IN THE FORM OF PRESSURE               
ADVECTION.  AFTER SUNRISE...THE LOWER TROP WILL BEGIN TO MIX OUT                
WHICH WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE THIS LOW LEVEL ZONE OF COLDER AIR.                  
UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ALONG WITH A RETURN OF SOUTHERLY                       
WINDS...TEMPERATURES WILL WARM INTO THE 40S THIS AFTERNOON.                     
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE REGION LATE TONIGHT.  DESPITE              
MODERATE FORCING IN ADVANCE OF THIS WAVE...PRESSURE CONDENSATION                
LEVELS ARE SO HIGH AND CAN NOT BE REALIZED DUE TO A VERY DRY                    
AIRMASS.  00Z SOUNDINGS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS                  
MEASURED PWATS LESS THAN ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH.  THEREFORE ONLY SOME           
MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS WILL RESULT FROM THE PASSAGE OF THIS                 
DISTURBANCE.                                                                    
SOUTHERLY WINDS AT THE SURFACE AND CLEAR SKIES WILL BOOST                       
TEMPERATURES UP A FEW MORE DEGREES FROM TODAYS EXPECTED READINGS.               
AS A MATTER OF FACT...I INCREASED TEMPERATURES IN MOST LOCATIONS A              
FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN MAV GUIDANCE.  PROGGED SURFACE TO 850                   
THICKNESSES CORRELATES WITH TEMPERATURES APPROACHING THE LOWER 50S

ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND SHOW GOOD RUN TO              
RUN CONSISTENCY WITH A SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR DURING THE DAY ON

.DISCUSSION...                                                                  
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS SHIFTING ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING IN            
THE WAKE OF THIS MORNINGS UPPER LOW THAT FORCED SOME LIGHT RAIN AND             
SNOW IN MOST AREAS.  SOME LINGERING STRATUS WAS LIMITING                        
TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING INTO THE TEENS ALONG THE OZARK PLATEAU.               
THIS STRATUS WILL LIKELY BURN OFF QUICKLY UPON SUNRISE THIS                     
MORNING.                                                                        
MEANWHILE...ANOTHER UPPER DISTURBANCE WILL APPROACH FROM                        
THE WEST LATE TONIGHT.  A MOISTURE STARVED ATMOSPHERE WILL KEEP                 
CONDITIONS DRY THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF THIS SYSTEM.  HOWEVER...I CAN             
NOT RULE OUT SOME PRECIP CHANCES FOR MONDAY AS A SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR            
RUSHES INTO THE REGION.  THIS CHANGE IN AIRMASS WAS THE MAIN                    
FORECAST CHALLENGE IN THIS MORNINGS ANALYSIS AS SINGLE DIGIT                    
READINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY MID WEEK.                                          
SHORT TERM (TODAY - TUESDAY NIGHT)...                                           
RUC 275K POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE SURFACE EXPLAINS WHY STRATUS IS                  
LINGERING ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE I-44 CORRIDOR.  A TROUGH AXIS                  
APPEARS TO BE STATIONARY NEAR THIS CORRIDOR...AND WEAK FLOW ACROSS              
THE AXIS IS PROVIDING A WEAK BAND OF LIFT IN THE FORM OF PRESSURE               
ADVECTION.  AFTER SUNRISE...THE LOWER TROP WILL BEGIN TO MIX OUT                
WHICH WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE THIS LOW LEVEL ZONE OF COLDER AIR.                  
UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ALONG WITH A RETURN OF SOUTHERLY                       
WINDS...TEMPERATURES WILL WARM INTO THE 40S THIS AFTERNOON.                     
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE REGION LATE TONIGHT.  DESPITE              
MODERATE FORCING IN ADVANCE OF THIS WAVE...PRESSURE CONDENSATION                
LEVELS ARE SO HIGH AND CAN NOT BE REALIZED DUE TO A VERY DRY                    
AIRMASS.  00Z SOUNDINGS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS                  
MEASURED PWATS LESS THAN ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH.  THEREFORE ONLY SOME           
MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS WILL RESULT FROM THE PASSAGE OF THIS                 
DISTURBANCE.                                                                    
SOUTHERLY WINDS AT THE SURFACE AND CLEAR SKIES WILL BOOST                       
TEMPERATURES UP A FEW MORE DEGREES FROM TODAYS EXPECTED READINGS.               
AS A MATTER OF FACT...I INCREASED TEMPERATURES IN MOST LOCATIONS A              
FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN MAV GUIDANCE.  PROGGED SURFACE TO 850                   
THICKNESSES CORRELATES WITH TEMPERATURES APPROACHING THE LOWER 50S              
ON SUNDAY.  AGAIN...NO PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE REST OF            
THE WEEKEND.                                                                    
ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND SHOW GOOD RUN TO              
RUN CONSISTENCY WITH A SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR DURING THE DAY ON                    
MONDAY.  TEMPERATURES AT THIS POINT WILL EXPERIENCE A COOLING TREND             
THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  LOWER TEENS OR SINGLE DIGIT READINGS CAN NOT BE             
RULED OUT TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING...AS THE COLDEST AREA            
OF THIS AIRMASS SPREADS DIRECTLY OVER THE EASTERN PLAINS AND OZARKS             
REGION.                                                                         
I INSERTED SOME SMALL POPS FOR MONDAYS DAY PERIOD.  IT APPEARS AS               
THOUGH THERE WILL BE SOME UPPER SUPPORT CREATING LIFT AS THE ARCTIC             
SURGE OCCURS.  MODELS SUGGEST A LOT OF DRY AIR ABOVE                            
500MB...HOWEVER...SUFFICIENT SHALLOW MOISTURE WILL EXIST FOR SLIGHT             
CHANCES OF LIGHT SNOW OR RAIN.                                                  
LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY - FRIDAY)...                                               
FLOW OVER MOST OF THE NATIONS MID SECTION DURING THE LONG TERM WILL             
BE MOSTLY ZONAL AS A LONG WAVE RIDGE BEGINS TO DEAMPLIFY AS IT                  
PROGRESSES OVERHEAD.  THIS PATTERN SHOULD RESULT IN ABOVE NORMAL                
TEMPERATURES AND LITTLE TO NO RAIN CHANCES.  DESPITE A GOOD                     
POSSIBILITY OF SOUTHERLY FLOW...THE SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN ACROSS             
THE GULF COAST STATES IS CONDUCIVE FOR OFF SHORE FLOW...ULTIMATELY              
SHUTTING DOWN ANY POSSIBLE MOISTURE RETURN.                                     
CRAMER

FOR THE 06Z TAFS...STUBBORN MVFR STRATUS APPEARS TO BE MAKING ITS               
LAST STAND OVER SPRINGFIELD AND JOPLIN LATE THIS EVENING.                       
HIGHER CLOUD DECK MOVING IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST IS MASKING BACK                  
EDGE OF STRATUS ON INFRARED SATELLITE...SO ANY CLOUD INFO FROM                  
PILOTS WOULD BE HELPFUL.                                                        
BASED ON AREA SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND UPPER FLOW MOVEMENT...WILL               
START THE KJLN TAF AT VFR AND IMPROVE CEILINGS TO VFR AT KSGF BY                
AROUND 07Z. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE NIGHT AS            
PRESSURE GRADIENT RELAXES IN WAKE OF SURFACE HIGH BUILDING ACROSS               
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS.                                                            
ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE AREA THIS EVENING. DO NOT                
PLAN TO CARRY PRECIP AT THIS TIME BUT WILL LOWER A BROKEN DECK TO               
AROUND 10KFT AFTER 00Z.

NORTHEAST PA THROUGH 5 PM... BUT THIS PROGRESSION WILL LIKELY SLOW              
AS THE PRECIPITATION BEGINS TO OUTRUN ITS FORCING. MAIN SHOT OF

ONSET OF THIS EVENT ACROSS NORTHEAST PA. THE GFS FORECAST SOUNDING

CONFINE MIXED PRECIPITATION MAINLY TO AREAS SOUTH OF I-80.

SOUTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH                
ABOUT 09Z WHEN SIGNIFICANT FRONTOGENESIS IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP

THE CATSKILLS. HAVE GONE WITH A HEAVY SNOW WARNING FOR UP TO 8

NOT AS IMPRESSIVE... BUT BROAD-SCALE LIFT FOR SEVERAL HOURS SHOULD              
STILL BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A WIDESPREAD 3 TO 6 INCH SNOW EVENT.

NORTHEAST OFF THE EAST COAST. AS THE LOW DEPARTS...POP DECREASES                
RAPIDLY FROM W TO E BY AROUND 2 AM MONDAY. MODEL T-SECTIONS SHOW THE            
WHOLE COLUMN OVER THE CWFA DRYING OUT...SO SUNNY SKIES ARE EXPECTED             
MONDAY UNDER WSW FLOW. THIS WILL ALLOW MAX TEMPS TO BE WELL ABOVE

GENERALLY CLEAR...BUT I HAVE MIN TEMPS ABOVE MOS CONSENSUS...DUE TO             
THE WAA FLOW. A STRONG COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREAT LAKES               
LOW IS PROGGED TO ENTER THE MTNS BY AROUND 06Z TUESDAY. SOME LOW                
LEVEL MOISTURE IS SHOWN IN THE MODELS WITH THIS...AND UPSLOPE AREAS             
MAY SEE SOME ISO/SCT SHOWERS BEFORE DAWN TUESDAY. MODEL THICKNESSES             
AND P-TYPE NOMOGRAM INDICATE THAT ANY PRECIP WILL LIKELY BE ALL SNOW.           
TUESDAY...STRONG LOW LEVEL CAA CONTINUES ACROSS THE CWFA BEHIND THE             
FRONT...AS LOW PRESSURE TO OUR NE DEEPENS AND A STRONG SFC HIGH                 
BUILDS INTO THE GREAT PLAINS. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS SHOW A LULL IN               
THE 850MB WINDS (GENERALLY AFTER THE INITIAL SHORTWAVE PASSES BY).              
WITH THIS IN MIND...I DID NOT INCREASE POP FOR THIS PERIOD (LOW-MID             
CHC). 850 TEMPS CONTINUE TO FALL DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY...AND                
ETA/GFS BUFKIT SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT ALL PRECIP IN THE MTNS WILL              
PROBABLY BE ALL SNOW. MOS TEMPS SEEM TOO HIGH IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN.            
FOR NOW...I WENT WITH MET TEMPS FOR MAX TUESDAY IN THE MTNS WITH A

WEDNESDAY. IN ADDITION TO THE ADDED LIFT...LOW LEVEL TRAJECTORIES               
SHOW A GREAT LAKES CONNECTION WITH EVEN SOME SMALL SBCAPE. SO POP               
INCREASES TO LIKELY ALONG THE TN BORDER (WITH THE HIGHEST SNOW                  
ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED). THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY TIME THAT SOME SNOW            
SHOWERS COULD BREAK CONTAINMENT...BUT I DID NOT ADD THIS TO THE                 
GRIDS AT THIS TIME. OVERALL...MIN TEMPS PLUMMET INTO THE SINGLE                 
DIGITS AND TEENS IN THE MTNS (LOWER TO MID 20S PIEDMONT). WIND

BEGIN TO DRY OUT AND UPSLOPE FLOW WEAKENS. THE GFS SEEMS TO CUT OFF             
PRECIP ABRUPTLY BY 12Z. HOWEVER...I THINK THIS MAY BE TOO FAST...AND            
HAVE KEPT CHC POP IN THROUGH THE AFTN. WITH LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES               
VERY COLD...MAX TEMPS WILL BE 5-10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL (EVEN MORE              
IN THE MTNS).

THURSDAY. ATMOSPHERE WILL DRY OUT AND REMAIN STABLE THROUGH THE                 
WEEKEND AS THE RIDGE MOVES EAST OVER THE ATLANTIC. TEMPS AND LOW                
LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES WILL SLOWLY INCREASE AS TEMPS APPROACH THE 60            
DEGREE MARK...WHILE LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE SOUTHERLY AND                   
UNIFORM OVER THE REGION BY LATE IN THE WEEKEND. BOTH NEW RUNS OF THE            
GFS AND ECMWF ARE COMPARABLE WITH REGARDS TO THE STRENGTH OF THE

ACROSS THE EASTERN CONUS MONDAY...AS A SFC LOW DEEPENS AND TRACK                
NORTHEAST OFF THE EAST COAST. AS THE LOW DEPARTS...POP DECREASES                
RAPIDLY FROM W TO E BY AROUND 2 AM MONDAY. MODEL T-SECTIONS SHOW THE            
WHOLE COLUMN OVER THE CWFA DRYING OUT...SO SUNNY SKIES ARE EXPECTED             
MONDAY UNDER WSW FLOW. THIS WILL ALLOW MAX TEMPS TO BE WELL ABOVE               
NORMAL (AROUND 60 PIEDMONT AND 50S MTNS).                                       
MONDAY NIGHT...LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE GREAT LAKES...AS A                
POTENT SHORTWAVE CROSSES THE MIDWEST. LOW LEVEL FLOW OUT AHEAD OF IT            
WILL BE OUT OF THE SOUTH AND SW...HOWEVER DRY. SO SKIES WILL BE                 
GENERALLY CLEAR...BUT I HAVE MIN TEMPS ABOVE MOS CONSENSUS...DUE TO             
THE WAA FLOW. A STRONG COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREAT LAKES               
LOW IS PROGGED TO ENTER THE MTNS BY AROUND 06Z TUESDAY. SOME LOW                
LEVEL MOISTURE IS SHOWN IN THE MODELS WITH THIS...AND UPSLOPE AREAS             
MAY SEE SOME ISO/SCT SHOWERS BEFORE DAWN TUESDAY. MODEL THICKNESSES             
AND P-TYPE NOMOGRAM INDICATE THAT ANY PRECIP WILL LIKELY BE ALL SNOW.           
TUESDAY...STRONG LOW LEVEL CAA CONTINUES ACROSS THE CWFA BEHIND THE             
FRONT...AS LOW PRESSURE TO OUR NE DEEPENS AND A STRONG SFC HIGH                 
BUILDS INTO THE GREAT PLAINS. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS SHOW A LULL IN               
THE 850MB WINDS (GENERALLY AFTER THE INITIAL SHORTWAVE PASSES BY).              
WITH THIS IN MIND...I DID NOT INCREASE POP FOR THIS PERIOD (LOW-MID             
CHC). 850 TEMPS CONTINUE TO FALL DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY...AND                
ETA/GFS BUFKIT SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT ALL PRECIP IN THE MTNS WILL              
PROBABLY BE ALL SNOW. MOS TEMPS SEEM TOO HIGH IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN.            
FOR NOW...I WENT WITH MET TEMPS FOR MAX TUESDAY IN THE MTNS WITH A              
BLEND ELSEWHERE.

CANADA...WITH DPVA DEVELOPING ACROSS THE MTNS STARTING 00Z                      
WEDNESDAY. IN ADDITION TO THE ADDED LIFT...LOW LEVEL TRAJECTORIES               
SHOW A GREAT LAKES CONNECTION WITH EVEN SOME SMALL SBCAPE. SO POP               
INCREASES TO LIKELY ALONG THE TN BORDER (WITH THE HIGHEST SNOW                  
ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED). THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY TIME THAT SOME SNOW            
SHOWERS COULD BREAK CONTAINMENT...BUT I DID NOT ADD THIS TO THE                 
GRIDS AT THIS TIME. OVERALL...MIN TEMPS PLUMMET INTO THE SINGLE                 
DIGITS AND TEENS IN THE MTNS (LOWER TO MID 20S PIEDMONT). WIND                  
CHILLS WILL APPROACH ADVISORY CRITERIA AS WELL.                                 
WEDNESDAY...NW FLOW SNOW EVENT BEGINS TO WIND DOWN...AS LOW LEVELS              
BEGIN TO DRY OUT AND UPSLOPE FLOW WEAKENS. THE GFS SEEMS TO CUT OFF             
PRECIP ABRUPTLY BY 12Z. HOWEVER...I THINK THIS MAY BE TOO FAST...AND            
HAVE KEPT CHC POP IN THROUGH THE AFTN. WITH LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES               
VERY COLD...MAX TEMPS WILL BE 5-10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL (EVEN MORE              
IN THE MTNS).

WEEKEND AS THE RIDGE MOVES EAST OVER THE ATLANTIC. TEMPS AND LOW                
LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES WILL SLOWLY INCREASE AS TEMPS APPROACH THE 60            
DEGREE MARK...WHILE LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE SOUTHERLY AND                   
UNIFORM OVER THE REGION BY LATE IN THE WEEKEND. BOTH NEW RUNS OF THE            
GFS AND ECMWF ARE COMPARABLE WITH REGARDS TO THE STRENGTH OF THE

MAIN CONCERN IS THE FOG AND LOW CLOUDS AND THE EFFECTS THIS WILL                
HAVE ON TEMPERATURES.  APPEARS THAT THE BACK EDGE OF THE STRATUS HAS            
NOW MOVED EAST OF THE JAMES VALLEY AND IS VERY CLOSE TO I90. IN                 
ADDITION...WEAK SOUTHEAST FLOW ACROSS THE AREA IS HELPING TO ADVECT             
COLDER AIR UNDER THE CLOUDS SO THAT PLACES LIKE MHE...FSD AND SPW               
HAVE ALREADY FALLEN SEVERAL DEGREES. EXPECT THAT THE LOW CLOUDS WILL            
RETREAT A BIT MORE TONIGHT AND GENERALLY BE OVER SW MN AND EAST                 
CENTRAL SD. JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE CLOUDS THERE WILL BE A BAND OF             
FOG WITH VSBYS BELOW 1 SM AT TIMES WHERE DEEP ENOUGH MOISTURE                   
RESIDES AND COOLING OCCURS. INTERESTINGLY...WITH TEMPS BELOW                    
14F/-10C...SOME ICE CRYSTALS/SNOW ARE FALLING OUT OF THE FOG AROUND             
FSD AND WOULDN`T BE SURPRISED IF THERE ARE VERY LOCALIZED FLURRIES              
IN THE DENSER FOG ONCE TEMPS FALL TO NEAR 10F/-12C.                             
OTHERWISE...EXPECT SKIES MOSTLY CLEAR WITH SOME LIGHT PATCHY FOG                
SOUTH OF I90. THIS WILL REALLY SET UP A CONTRAST IN TEMPERATURES.               
ALREADY YANKTON...VERMILLION...AND A LARGE PORTION OF NW IOWA IS                
BELOW 10F WITH DEW POINTS NEAR ZERO. WITH ONLY LIGHT SE FLOW...SEE              
NO REASON TEMPS WON`T FALL TO NEAR ZERO WITH BELOW ZERO IN RIVER                
VALLEYS AND OTHER DRAINAGE AREAS. ALSO EXPECT THAT ALONG I90 FROM               
9V9 TO LYV AS WELL AS THE NORTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES IN NW IA...TEMPS            
WILL FALL INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS. ONLY PORTIONS OF SW MN WILL LIKELY            
STAY...AS WELL AS AROUND 9V9...WILL STAY ABOVE 10 F EITHER BECAUSE              
OF LOW CLODUS OR BECAUSE OF INCREASING SE FLOW AIDING IN SOME MIXING.           
DID SLOW THE INCREASE IN CLOUDS TONIGHT IN THE SRN CWA ALTHOUGH THE             
18Z NAM SUGGESTS THAT CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO REFORM IN NW IA TOWARD             
DAWN. NEW GRIDS AND PFM AVAILABLE AND UPDATED ZFP SHOULD BE                     
AVAILABLE BY 0240Z.

WIDE VARIATION IN CEILINGS AND VSBYS ACROSS CWA THIS EVENING. LOW

POTENTIAL FOR RADITATION FOG AFTER 09Z AT KHON AND PROBABLY CLOSER              
TO 11Z KSUX AREA...WITH VSBYS DOWN TO AROUND 2 MILES IN BR. STRATUS

BE SLOW TO MIX OUT WITH STRONG INVERSION AND WEAK MIXING GRADIENT

A COUPLE CHALLENGES FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. FIRST IS WITH THE                 
EXTENT OF STRATUS CLEARING IN THE SRN AND WRN CWA. ACROSS NW                    
IW...STATUS/FOG HAVE BEEN SLOWLY LIFTING NWRN AT AROUND 6 KTS                   
THROUGH THE DAY...BUT ACCORDING TO RUC AND NAM 950 MB RH FIELDS...              
THE CLEARING SHOULD CHECK UP BY EARLY THIS EVENING...WITH THE NRN               
EXTENT OF CLEARING ON A E/W LINE ROUGHLY AROUND SPENCER IOWA. S OF              
THIS AREA...TEMPERATURES WILL RAPIDLY DROP THIS EVENING AND FOG WILL            
LIKELY FORM...AND COULD BECOME DENSE IN PLACES BY LATE THIS EVENING.            
TOUGH TO TELL THE AMOUNT OF CLEARING ALONG THE WRN EDGE OF THE                  
STRATUS IN CENTRAL SD BASED ON SATELLITE...BUT DOES APPEAR CLEARING             
LINE IS ALMOST TO MHE. WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES NEAR STEADY WHERE                 
STRATUS IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AND DROP TEMPERATURES QUITE A BIT               
ELSEWHERE. SHOULD SEE A 25 TO 30 DEGREE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE IN               
LOWS FROM CLEAR SKIES TO PLACES WITH CLOUD COVER. EXPECTING FOG                 
ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA...EVEN WHERE STRATUS HOLDS  COULD SEE                    
CEILINGS DROP TO THE SFC LATER TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY SINCE WARM AIR              
ADVECTION WILL PERSIST. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR DENSE FOG IN                 
THESE AREAS AS WELL...WITH VISIBILITIES REDUCED TO LESS THAN ONE                
QUARTER MILE. ACTUALLY A THIN BAND OF QUARTER MILE VISIBILITIES HAS             
CONTINUED THROUGH THE DAY OF OVER PORTIONS OF NW IA...WHILE SLOWLY              
DRIFTING N. ONCE DAYTIME HEATING IS NOT LONGER A FACTOR...SHOULD SEE

.SYNOPSIS...A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP THROUGH ALL OF UTAH THIS EVENING            
WITH VERY COLD AIR BEHIND IT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA            
MONDAY THROUGH MID WEEK. THIS WILL BRING A STRONG WARMING TREND TO              
THE MOUNTAINS ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WHILE INVERSIONS STRENGTHEN              
IN THE VALLEYS. A SERIES OF PACIFIC STORMS WILL RETURN FOR LATE IN              
THE WEEK.                                                                       
&&                                                                              
.DISCUSSION...SURFACE COLD FRONT HAS SHIFTED SOUTH INTO CENTRAL UTAH            
WITH MID LEVEL BAROCLINIC ZONE LAGGING BEHIND. RADAR TREND IS                   
DECREASING AND SHIFTING SLIGHTLY SOUTHWARD INTO CENTRAL MOUNTAINS.              
SNOW WAS HEAVY ALONG THIS BOUNDARY WITH STEEP LAPSE RATES UP TO 600             
MB AND MODERATE WESTERLY FLOW. 1 TO 2 INCH PER HOUR RATES IN THE SL             
VALLEY AT THE PEAK AND 2 TO 3 INCHES IN THE MOUNTAINS.                          
RADAR DEPICTING SNOW SHOWERS INCREASING ACROSS THE IDAHO BORDER                 
PAST HOUR...THIS WILL SPILL SOUTHWARD ACROSS NORTHERN UTAH THIS                 
EVENING. COLD POOL ALOFT...500 MB...REMAINS TO THE NORTH IN IDAHO               
AND IS CREATING A STRONG JET CORE ALONG THE IDAHO BORDER. NAM/GFS               
AND RUC SAG THIS GRADIENT SOUTHWARD SO WE COOL FROM -24C AT SLC                 
NOW...TO -28C THIS EVENING. AT THE SAME TIME COOLING CONTINUES BELOW            
WITH -17C AT 700 MB BY LATE EVENING. THUS STEEP LAPSE RATES WILL                
CONTINUE THIS EVENING WITH THE INVERSION BASE PROGGED TO RISE UP TO             
600 MB BEFORE LOWERING AGAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN THE UPPER JET                  
STREAK BEGINS TO EXIT AND THE THERMAL GRADIENT AT 500 MB LEVEL                  
SLOWLY RETREATS NORTHWARD. THE WAVE ALONG THIS GRADIENT SHOULD                  
REDEVELOP SNOW EARLY THIS EVENING...ESPECIALLY ALONG THE TERRAIN                
WHERE NORTHWEST FLOW UPSLOPE FORCING WILL PERSIST FROM THE WASATCH              
PLATEAU NEAR MT PLEASANT NORTHWARD TO THE BEAR RIVER RANGE. THERE IS            
ALSO A WINDOW FOR LAKE ENHANCEMENT OR EVEN A BAND THIS EVENING                  
WITHIN UNIFORM NORTHWEST FLOW AND LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE AS THE VERY              
COLD AIR MASS FILTERS ACROSS THE GSL.                                           
COLD AIR SETTLES ACROSS UTAH WITH -18C ISOTHERM LINGERING INTO                  
MONDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE NORTH. THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR A VERY               
COLD DAY FOLLOWED BY BITTER COLD NIGHT AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. NAM              
AND GFS DISPLAY A 1052 MB SURFACE HIGH SETTLING OVER WYOMING. THIS              
SHOULD BE OUR COLDEST PERIOD SO FAR THIS YEAR FOR MANY PLACES AND               
EVEN BELOW ZERO POSSIBLE FOR SLC AT NIGHT. STRONG UPPER RIDGE RIDES             
OVER THE COLD DOME AND WARM 700 MB AIR TO 0C BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON IN            
LIGHT SOUTHWEST FLOW...LEADING TO STRONG INVERSION OVER SNOW COVERED            
VALLEYS.                                                                        
THIS UPPER RIDGE IS SHORT LIVED AND MODELS CONTINUE TO PROG                     
INCREASING SOUTHWEST FLOW WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. 55 KNOTS OF MOIST            
ADVECTION AT 700 MB FORECAST BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE WRN               
PTN OF UT. STRONG SOUTHERLY MILD FLOW AND TRAPPED COLD AIR WILL                 
CREATE NORTHERN VALLEY PTYPE ISSUES BUT LIKELY ALL SNOW FOR                     
NORTHEAST VALLEYS LIKE UINTA BASIN. SHOULD BE ABLE TO MIX OUT THE               
WESTERN VALLEYS BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON GIVEN PROGGED FLOW AND                    
PRESSURE GRADIENT. LARGE EPAC TROF SENDS A WAVE ACROSS THE GREAT                
BASIN THURSDAY NGT INTO FRIDAY...AND THEN ANOTHER WAVE AND COLD                 
FRONT SATURDAY AFTN INTO SUNDAY. ECMWF STRONGER WITH THE SECOND WAVE            
THAN THE GFS. GFS ENSEMBLE SPREAD IS SMALL FOR NEXT WEEKEND WITH                
SPREAD DEVELOPING NOT UNTIL THE FINAL WAVE. THIS DEEP UPPER TROUGH              
ADVERTISED TO DIG ACROSS THE WEST COAST AND SEND A STRONG COLD FRONT            
THRU UT BY LATE SUNDAY AND INTO MON. A STATEWIDE EVENT DUE TO THE               
INITIALLY WAVE TAKING A DIRECT HIT AND THE FINAL SYSTEM DIGGING FAR             
SOUTH. RATHER HIGH CHANCES IN THE GRIDS WITH LIKELY VALUES IN THE               
MOUNTAINS.

.AVIATION...SNOW SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE VICINITY OF               
SLC TERMINAL BETWEEN 03Z AND 07Z THIS EVENING WITH A 30 PERCENT                 
CHANCE OF SNOW DIRECTLY IMPACTING THE TERMINAL WITH MVFR OR IFR                 
CONDITIONS. THERE IS A 30 PERCENT CHANCE THAT WINDS COULD SHIFT TO              
THE SOUTHEAST AS EARLY AS 04Z DUE TO HEAVIER SNOW SHOWERS BANKED UP

A BROAD BAND OF -SN/FLURRIES ACROSS CENTRAL MN INTO CENTRAL WI.                 
29/12Z NAM/GFS LOOK TO HAVE INITIALIZED QUITE WELL AND PRESENT                  
RATHER SIMILAR SOLUTIONS FOR TONIGHT INTO TUE NIGHT. NAM DOES REMAIN

CONFIDENCE IN THE SHORT TERM AVERAGE TO GOOD THIS CYCLE.                        
FOR THE SHORT TERM...WEAK 850MB WARM ADVECTION PERSISTS TONIGHT.                
SOUNDINGS AND X-SECTIONS INDICATE SOME DECREASE OF THE DEPTH OF                 
MOISTURE THRU THE NIGHT...BUT THIS LOOKS OFF-SET BY SOME WEAK 700MB             
WARM ADVECTION SPREADING INTO THE AREA. TEMP AT THE TOP OF MOIST                
LAYER REMAINS AROUND -10C. PREVIOUS FORECAST HAD -FZDZ/FLURRY

WITH THE SNOW COVER AND COOLING...ALONG WITH THE DEEPER WARM                    
ADVECTION OVER THE TOP OF THIS LAYER...CLEARING MAY BRIEFLY MAKE IT

REDEVELOP. -SN/-FZDZ THREAT CONTINUES ON SUN WITH SLIGHTLY STRONGER             
850-700MB WARM ADVECTION OVER/IN THE TOP OF THE MOIST LAYER.                    
CONFINED -SN CHANCE AND SMALL BUT HIGHER POP ACROSS THE NORTH PART

NIGHT THRU TUE THE SERIES OF SHORTWAVES SLIDE ACROSS OR JUST                    
SOUTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS AND TIME-HGT X-                 
SECTIONS INDICATE AN INCREASED DEPTH OF MOISTURE AS THESE SHORTWAVE             
PASS. THIS AS THE STRENGTH/DEPTH OF THE CYCLONIC FLOW INCREASES AND             
THE AIRMASS SLOWLY COOLS. THIS WITH SOME PV ADVECTION AND 700-300MB             
QG CONVERGENCE WITH THE PASSING SHORTWAVES. GFS WETTER IN THE MID/

GENERALLY WEAK CONVERGENCE/LIFT...-SN POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE FOR              
SUN NIGHT/MON LOOK GOOD AND RAISED THEM INTO CHANCE RANGE FOR MON               
NIGHT/TUE. THESE CHANCES GENERALLY BLEND WELL WITH NEIGHBORING                  
GRIDS. STILL PLENTY OF TIME TO DETAIL ANY PERIODS OF HIGHER -SN                 
CHANCES OR POSSIBLE ACCUMULATING LIGHT SNOW ONCE TIMING OF ANY                  
SHORTWAVE OR STRONGER PERIODS OF LIFT CAN BE DETERMINED. WITH

EACH OTHER AND THEIR PREVIOUS RUNS IN THE WED-SAT PERIOD. ECMWF                 
GENERALLY SHOWS THE BETTER RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY. SOME LESSER                  
TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE PROGRESSIVENESS OF THE EAST/WEST COAST              
TROUGHS FOR THU-SAT WITH GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN LOOKING TO BE A GOOD                 
COMPROMISE. FORECAST CONFIDENCE IN THE LONG TERM REMAINS AVERAGE TO             
GOOD. LONGWAVE RIDGING MOVES INTO CENTRAL NOAM BY WED. COLD CANADIAN            
SFC HIGH UNDER/EAST OF THE RIDGE AXIS SLIDES ACROSS THE AREA WED/WED            
NIGHT FOR A SEASONABLY COLD PERIOD. EVEN WITH THE AMPLIFIED LONGWAVE            
PATTERN OVER NOAM/EASTERN PAC BY MIDWEEK...IT REMAINS PROGRESSIVE AS            
STRONG ENERGY IN THE EASTERN PAC/GULF OF AK PUSHES EAST. THE SFC                
HIGH RETREATS LATER WED NIGHT/THU WITH STRONG 850-700MB WARM                    
ADVECTION SPREADING ACROSS THE AREA. MUCH OF THIS GOES INTO WARMING             
AND HGTS/RIDGING ALOFT BUILDING ACROSS THE REGION. STRONG INVERSION             
DEVELOPS OVER THE AREA IN THE 925-850MB LAYER FOR THU INTO FRI...DUE            
TO EXPANSIVE SNOW FIELD ACROSS THE REGION. INVERSION AND THE SNOW               
COVER WILL TEMPER THE WARMUP IN THE LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION FLOW               
FOR THU INTO SAT. BIGGEST QUESTION IS POTENTIAL FOR LOW CLOUD/                  
STRATUS DEVELOPMENT AS THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST EDGES OF THE SNOW COVER              
START TO MELT AND THIS MOISTURE IS ADVECTED NORTH UNDER THE                     
INVERSION. THIS ESPECIALLY SO BY THU NIGHT AND BEYOND. LEFT SKY                 
GRIDS IN THE PARTLY CLOUDY RANGE FOR THU NIGHT THRU FRI NIGHT FOR               
NOW. MODELS RATHER CONSISTENT IN EJECTING A STRONGER PIECE OF ENERGY            
OUT OF THE WEST COAST TROUGH AND INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST SAT. SMALL              
-RA/-SN CHANCE ON SAT REASONABLE FOR NOW WITH A SHORTWAVE TROUGH                
MOVING THRU AND SOME WARM AIR ALOFT OVER THE AREA. LEANED TOWARD                
COOLER OF GUIDANCE MAXES/MINS FOR WED THRU THU...THEN COOLER OF                 
GUIDANCE HIGHS FOR FRI/SAT WITH THE SNOW COVER AND POTENTIAL FOR LOW            
CLOUDS. POTENTIAL FOR LOW CLOUDS AND SOME SOUTH WINDS THU/FRI NIGHTS            
LEADS TO FAVORING WARMER OF GUIDANCE LOWS THESE PERIODS.                        
AVIATION...TONIGHT AND SUNDAY                                                   
PERSISTENCE LOOKS LIKE BEST BET RIGHT NOW WITH WEAK SURFACE RIDGE               
PASSING THROUGH THE AREA AND MVFR CONDITIONS REMAIN FAIRLY STABLE.              
WEAK WARM AIR ADVECTION SPAWNED SOME LIGHT SNOW EARLIER BUT BULK OF             
THAT ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT NORTHEAST TONIGHT. AS SOUTH TO             
SOUTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES TONIGHT WITH RIDGE PASSAGE...EXPECT MVFR               
CONDITIONS TO GRADUALLY SLIP TO IFR WITH LOWERING CEILINGS AND                  
VISIBILITIES AGAIN AS THE NIGHT GOES ON. COULD SEE SOME IMPROVEMENT             
TOMORROW BUT APPROACH OF SHORT WAVE TROUGH MAY HELP GENERATE ENOUGH             
LIFT FOR SPORADIC LIGHT SNOW OR FREEZING DRIZZLE AS WELL.

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SOUTHEAST OF LONG ISLAND WILL RAPIDLY MOVE

LOW PRES SYSTEM OVER THE OH VALLEY WILL INTENSIFY AS IT MOVES ENE               
TOWARD THE REGION NEW YEAR`S DAY. A SECONDARY LOW IS FORECAST TO                
DEVELOP OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST AND TRACK NE AS A SURGE OF                    
ARCTIC AIR MOVES SSE ACROSS THE REGION WED INTO THU. THE ARCTIC

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 9 AM THIS MORNING/...                                         
A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 9 AM FOR NYC`S                
EXTREME NW AND N SUBURBS...FOR A LIGHT WINTRY MIX OF WET                        
SNOW...SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN.                                                 
BASED ON THE NE ADVECTION OF STRONG UPPER AND MID LVL SUBSIDENCE                
ACROSS THE REGION...THE SW FRINGE OF THIS LOW/S ASSOCIATED                      
PRECIPITATION SHIELD HAS DRYED. BECAUSE THE UPPER LVL WAVE IS OPEN              
AND PROGRESSIVE...I/M NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIP TO WRAP AROUND THIS              
DEVELOPING LOW AND MAKE IT FAR ENOUGH S TO AFFECT OUR REGION. WE                
MAY DECIDE TO CANCEL THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY EARLIER THAN 9 AM              
BASED ON CURRENT OBSERVATIONS AND FCST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM /9 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...                            
FOR TODAY...NEW YEAR/S EVE...A MILD AND DRY...BUT GUSTY DAY IS ON               
TAP FOR THE REGION AS A STRONG W WIND FLOW INCREASES DOWN SLOPE                 
ACROSS THE AREA...CAUSING TEMPS TO RISE TO NEAR 50 DEGS ACROSS                  
PARTS OF NYC...MILDER THAN OUR PREV FORECASTS.                                  
FOR NEW YEAR/S DAY...IT LOOKS LIKE A WET ONE ACROSS MOST OF THE                 
REGION...WITH THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY              
ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY NY.                                                        
AS AN INTENSIFYING LOW MOVES ENE FROM THE OHIO VALLEY...A BRISK SE              
WIND FLOW WILL DEVELOP AND QUICKLY WARM THE SURFACE AND BOUNDARY                
LAYER ALONG THE COAST. THE UPPER LVL DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS              
SYSTEM ARE FAIRLY STRONG AND UP TO 1/2 INCH OF RAIN IS QUITE                    
POSSIBLE BEFORE A SECONDARY DEVELOPS LATE IN THE GAME. IT APPEARS               
THAT PRECIP WILL DEVELOP AS A WINTRY MIX OF WET SNOW...SLEET AND                
FREEZING RAIN ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY THAT COULD MEET ADVISORY                     
CRITERIA BASED ON THE INTENSITY OF THE UPSTREAM LOW. STAY TUNED.                
FOR WEDNESDAY...PREPARE FOR AN ARCTIC SURGE. THERE SHOULD BE JUST               
ENOUGH LOW LVL MOISTURE POOLING AHEAD OF THE FRONT TO CAUSE SCT                 
SNOW SHOWERS...SOME MODERATE BASED ON INSTABILITY PROFILES. IN                  
FACT...AS AN UPPER LVL LOW AND TROUGH APPROACHES THE REGION...THIS              
COMBO MAKES SNOW SHOWERS LIKELY ACROSS THE REGION. ALTHOUGH A 30                
PCT POP WAS INTRODUCED FOR WED...I REALLY THINK A 60 OR 70 PCT POP              
FOR SNOW SHOWERS IS MORE REALISTIC WHERE MOST AREAS WILL PICK UP                
ANYWHERE FROM A DUSTING TO 1 INCH.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...                                  
WIND CHILLS BECOME A PROBLEM FOR WED NIGHT...WITH VALUES                        
APPROACHING 10 TO 15 DEGS BELOW ZERO. STAY TUNED FOR A POTENTIAL                
WIND CHILL ADVISORY.                                                            
OTHERWISE...THE ARCTIC AIR MASS WILL GRADUALLY MODIFY THROUGH                   
FRIDAY.                                                                         
THE RETURN FLOW AROUND THE HIGH...WILL BRING WELL ABOVE NORMAL                  
TEMPS ACROSS THE REGION BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND AS A 580-590 500              
MB HIGH DEVELOPS OFF THE SE US COAST. E MAY B DRESSING IN SHORTS

.AVIATION /10Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...                                        
GENERALLY IFR CONDITIONS PREVAIL ACROSS THE AREA. RUC SEEMS TO                  
HAVE THE BEST HANDLE ON THE SITUATION...ALTHOUGH STILL A LITTLE 1               
TO 2 DEGREES TOO COLD SIDE IN THE LOW LEVELS AS COMPARED TO 05Z                 
ACARS SOUNDING AT KLGA.                                                         
ALSO NOTING THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL DRYING ON WV IMAGERY INTRUDING              
INTO DELAWARE WHICH WILL BRING AN END TO THE DEEP MOISTURE AND                  
CHANGE RAIN TO DRIZZLE. THINK THIS WILL OCCUR IN THE NEXT 3 TO 4                
HOURS...POSSIBLY A FEW HOURS LATER AT KGON.                                     
WATCHING SFC TEMPS ACROSS INTERIOR LOCATIONS...KSWF HAS BEEN                    
RIGHT AT THE FREEZING MARK THE LAST FEW HOURS AND IT SHOULD HOLD                
HERE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT WHICH WOULD KEEP -FZRA THE                  
DOMINANT P-TYPE BEFORE CHANGING TO -FZDZ. HOWEVER...COULD SEE                   
SOME SNOW MIX IN AS THE COLUMN COOLS BETWEEN NOW AND 09Z. SAME                  
GOES FOR KHPN. ALL OTHER TERMINALS SHOULD REMAIN PLAIN RAIN/DRIZZLE.            
THAT SAID...EXPECT IFR CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL UNTIL AROUND 12Z.                  
COULD SEE SOME IMPROVEMENT BACK TO MVFR BETWEEN 10 AND 12Z. ALL                 
PRECIP SHOULD COME TO AN END BY 12/13Z WITH CONDITIONS IMPROVING                
BACK TO VFR AND ONLY GUSTY W/NW LEFT TO CONTEND WITH.                           
E/NE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BACK TO THE N THEN NW AS THE COASTAL                  
LOW PASSES TO THE SOUTH AND EAST LATE TONIGHT/EARLY MON MORNING.                
SUSTAINED WINDS SHOULD RANGE BETWEEN 12 AND 17 KT WITH GUSTS                    
BETWEEN 25 AND 30 KT AFTER 15Z. GUSTS SHOULD SUBSIDE EARLY IN THE               
EVENING AND BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE AFTER 00Z.                                
OUTLOOK FOR 06Z TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...VFR REMAINS THROUGH                  
MONDAY NIGHT. SUB-VFR CONDITIONS ARE AGAIN LIKELY TUESDAY AND                   
TUESDAY EVENING AS AN ALBERTA CLIPPER LOW AND COLD FRONT PASS                   
ACROSS THE AREA. RAIN NEAR THE COAST...RAIN/SNOW INTERIOR. THIS                 
WILL BE FOLLOWED BY GUSTY W-NW FLOW LATER TUE NIGHT THROUGH THU AS              
THE OFFSHORE LOW INTENSIFIES AND DRAWS DOWN ARCTIC AIR. LIGHT SNOW              
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES WILL BE POSSIBLE ON WEDNESDAY...OTHERWISE DRY.

WINDS HAVE INCREASED AS THE LOW HAS NEARED THE WATERS. EXPECT THE               
WINDS TO DIMINISH SOMEWHAT THROUGH THE MID MORNING HOURS AS LOW                 
PRESSURE AND LOW LEVEL JET PASSES TO THE EAST. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY             
REMAINS UP FOR THE OCEAN WATERS...AND WILL KEEP OTHER HEADLINES AS              
THEY ARE EVEN THOUGH WINDS ARE CURRENTLY QUITE CLOSE TO CRITERIA.               
AGAIN...WINDS WILL DIMINISH...THEN INCREASE IN WESTERLY FLOW BEHIND             
DEPARTING LOW LATER THIS MORNING.                                               
WINDS DIMINISH LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING AS HIGH PRESSURE            
BUILDS. THEN NEXT AREA OF LOW PRESSURE PASSES JUST TO THE NORTH OF              
THE WATERS TUESDAY...AND DRAGS A COLD FRONT THROUGH. STRONG WEST                
FLOW BEHIND THIS LOW/FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT. ARCTIC FRONT PIVOTS AROUND            
STRONG LOW PRESSURE WEDNESDAY...AND STRONG WEST WINDS TURN TO THE               
NORTHWEST AND REMAIN EQUALLY STRONG.

THIS FRONT...EXPECT STRONG NORTHWEST WINDS TO PREVAIL INTO THURSDAY.            
GALES QUITE POSSIBLE. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS AND CONDITIONS IMPROVE               
THU NIGHT AND FRI. HIGH PRES PASSES TO THE SOUTH FRI NIGHT...AND

DAYS 1-2...                                                                     
A PACIFIC FRONT PUSHED THROUGH WESTERN KANSAS DURING THE                        
OVERNIGHT, FORCED BY A DYNAMICALLY GENERATED SURFACE ANTICYCLONE                
OVER THE GREAT BASIN. THE INITIAL FRONTAL SURGE BROUGHT WINDS                   
GUSTING ABOVE 40 MPH IN PLACES. THE STEADY NORTHWEST WIND IS                    
HELPING TO KEEP THINGS MIXED IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER THIS MORNING.                
AT 08Z, 850MB TEMPS AT DDC WERE ABOUT 1C AND THIS IS LIKELY THE                 
REASON TEMPS HAVE RISEN BACK INTO THE LOW 30S. HOWEVER, COLD                    
ADVECTION AT 850MB IS UNDERWAY AND THESE TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO                 
FALL BEFORE MORNING. A BAND OF MID LEVEL MOISTURE AND LIFT IS ALSO              
SLICING SOUTHEAST ACROSS MY CWA THIS MORNING ALONG THE SURGING                  
700MB COLD FRONT. ALTHOUGH A FEW FLURRIES ARE POSSIBLE AS THE BAND              
OF MID CLOUD PUSHES SOUTH THIS MORNING, WEAK ECHOES ON RADAR AND DRY            
AIR BELOW 700MB SHOULD KEEP THIS TO A MINIMUM.                                  
THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT WILL DISPLAY A STRONG              
GSDM (GLOBAL SYNOPTIC DYNAMIC MODEL) LEGACY STAGE 2 LOOK, WITH A                
DEEP TROUGH IN PLACE OVER THE CENTRAL STATES/GREAT LAKES REGIONS.               
A PIECE OF THE HUDSON BAY VORTEX CURRENTLY OVER MANITOBA WILL                   
DROP SOUTH SOUTHEAST INTO THIS LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE MIDWEST,                
BRINGING A SLUG OF ARCTIC AIR SOUTH THROUGH THE PLAINS BY TUESDAY.              
AS IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE CASE, WITH NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT IN PLACE                
CHANCES OF PRECIP WILL BE NON-EXISTENT THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST                  
PERIOD.                                                                         
TODAY-- THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME MODEL DIFFERENCES TODAY REGARDING              
HOW STRONG THE WINDS WILL BE. THE GFS/NAM SUGGEST LIMITED VERTICAL              
MIXING AND WINDS ONLY ABOUT 30-35KTS AT THE TOP OF THE MIXED LAYER              
THIS AFTERNOON. THE EARLIER RUNS OF THE RUC13/20 SHOWED WINDS TO                
ADVISORY CRITERIA THIS AFTERNOON OVER WESTERN KS. THE LATEST RUN,               
HOWEVER, HAS COME DOWN ON THE WINDS AND THIS MAKES CONFIDENCE IN                
NOT GOING WITH AN ADVISORY HIGHER. WILL GO SEVERAL KNOTS ABOVE THE              
NAM12 GUIDANCE WITH GUSTS TO AROUND 30KTS IN THE GRIDS BUT WILL                 
NOT ISSUE ANY HEADLINES.                                                        
FOR TEMPS, I USED A BLEND OF MODEL SOUNDINGS FROM THE NAM/GFS/SREF              
AND MIXED DOWN THE AVERAGE LOW LEVEL TEMP DOWN DRY ADIABATIC TO THE             
SFC. THE NAM12 IS STILL STRUGGLING TO MIX THINGS OUT BELOW 900MB,               
PROBABLY DUE TO THE SNOW COVER IN THE MODEL AND AS A RESULT THE 2M              
TEMPS IN THE MODEL LOOK A TAD TOO COLD. WITH DEEPLY MIXED NORTHWEST             
FLOW IN PLACE SNOW COVER DOES NOT HAVE AS MUCH EFFECT ON THE                    
TEMPS AS IT WOULD OTHERWISE. EVEN WITH SNOW COVER OR ARCTIC AIR IN              
PLACE, MIXING OUT THE LOWEST 25MB OR SO IS ALMOST A GIVEN                       
ESPECIALLY WITH SOME SUNSHINE. HIGHS SHOULD REACH THE LOW 30S                   
WITH A CHILLY PACIFIC AIRMASS IN PLACE OVER WESTERN KANSAS.                     
TONIGHT-- WITH A STEADY WEST NORTHWEST WIND AT 10KTS OR GREATER                 
EXPECTED ALL NIGHT, LOWS SHOULD STAY UP IN THE TEENS OVER MUCH OF               
THE FORECAST AREA.                                                              
TUESDAY-- AN ARCTIC COLD FRONT CURRENTLY NEAR THE CANADIAN BORDER               
WILL OOZE SOUTH AND EAST INTO THE PLAINS AND WILL "BACK DOOR" FROM              
THE NORTHEAST INTO MY FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY. THE 00Z SUITE               
OF NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE IS FARTHER WEST WITH THIS ARCTIC SURGE              
THAN 24 HOURS AGO AND I HAVE THUS ADJUSTED MAXES DOWN SEVERAL                   
DEGREES FROM THE PREVIOUS FCST. EVEN WITH DECENT MIXING IN THE LOW              
LEVELS AND INSOLATION, MAXES WILL LIKELY NOT GET OUT OF THE 20S IN              
MOST PLACES.                                                                    
TUESDAY NIGHT-- SURFACE WINDS VEER TO WESTERLY AND THEN SOUTHWESTERLY           
AND BECOME LIGHT WITH THE SURFACE RIDGE SLIDING EAST ACROSS THE                 
FORECAST AREA. WHILE THE POSITION OF THE SFC RIDGE MAY NOT BE                   
TIMED RIGHT WITH THE COOLEST PART OF THE DAY, LOWS SHOULD STILL                 
DROP INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS UNDER CLEAR SKIES. AFTER ALL, IF THE                
PREVIOUS DAYS` HIGHS ARE ONLY IN THE 20S, IT DOESN`T TAKE MUCH FOR              
IT TO DROP INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS DURING THE LONG NIGHTS THIS TIME              
OF YEAR.

VERY FEW ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE EXISTING DAYS 3-7 FORECAST.               
ON WEDNESDAY...LOWERED MAX T`S A TAD AS THE INFLUENCE OF THE TUESDAY            
COLD FRONT WILL LIKELY LINGER A BIT LONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.             
THERE IS STILL SOME LIGHT SNOW COVER ON THE GROUND...AND THIS WILL              
SUPPRESS SURFACE HEATING A LITTLE.  ALSO...LOWERED DEW POINTS                   
WEDNESDAY MORNING AND ALSO FRIDAY MORNING.  ALSO...EXPECT CIRRUS AND            
PERHAPS A FEW MID LEVEL ALTOCUMULUS CLOUDS TO INCREASE WEDNESDAY...             
WHICH WILL THWART FULL SOLAR HEATING.  DID NOT CHANGE MUCH ELSE                 
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED.  DO NOT SEE MUCH CHANCE FOR ANY                        
PRECIPITATION.  WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOR MUCH             
OF THE THU-SAT PERIOD...SETTING UP A DOWNSLOPE CONDITION WHICH                  
SHOULD BRING A GRADUAL WARM UP.  HOW MUCH SNOW COVER WILL STILL                 
EXIST COULD AFFECT THE RESULTING MAX TEMPS...BUT THINK PLENTY OF SUN            
AND DOWNSLOPE WINDS WILL LEAD TO A MAJOR MELT OFF PRIOR TO FRIDAY.              
FOR NOW...WENT A FEW DEGREES WARMER ON SAT THAN ON FRI...THINKING               
THE WARM AIR WILL SLOWLY ERODE THE COLD BOUNDARY LAYER FROM                     
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST AND BE STRONGER ON SATURDAY. WILL BACK                   
TEMPERATURES DOWN A SHADE ON SUNDAY AS THE NORTHWEST DOWNSLOPE                  
AFFECT WILL BE LESSENED AS A SHORT WAVE APPROACHES FROM THE WEST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY-WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...                                          
TODAY/TONIGHT...WINDS WILL INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS UPPER                 
JET IN BETWEEN UPPER TROUGH SLOWLY MOVING TO OUR EAST AND                       
APPROACHING UPPER RIDGE TO OUR WEST DEVELOPS. QUESTION BECOMES                  
JUST HOW STRONG THE WINDS WILL BE...COMPLICATED BY SNOW PACK OVER               
MUCH OF THE AREA...DEEPEST ACROSS FAR EASTERN COLORADO AND                      
SOUTHWEST NEBRASKA. BASED ON A COMPILATION OF MOS GUIDANCE AND                  
RUC13/RUC WINDS HAVE PAINTED GENERALLY WINDY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE              
AREA. INTERESTING THAT THE RUC13 PICKS UP ON HIGHER SUSTAINED                   
WINDS EAST OF THE DEEPER SNOW PACK. TEMPERATURES WILL BE JUST AS                
TRICKY TODAY AS 850 TEMPERATURES DROP ABOUT 10-15F FROM SUNDAYS                 
READINGS. THIS ALONE (PLUS THE PAST FEW DAYS PERFORMANCE) WOULD                 
SUPPORT NEAR 20 ACROSS FLAGLER COLORADO TO THE MID 20S TO NEAR 30               
EAST OF THE CO/KS BORDER...WARMEST ACROSS THE EAST...SIMILAR TO THE             
NAM/GFS/SREF 2M TEMPS. MOS GUIDANCE WILL BE THROWN OUT AS IT HAS                
NO CLUE AS TO SNOW PACK OR AIRMASS IN THE AREA. FOR TONIGHT                     
NORTHWEST WINDS WILL REMAIN IN THE 15-25 MPH RANGE PREVENTING A                 
COMPLETE DROP IN MIN TEMPS. HOWEVER...WITH 850 TEMPERATURES STILL               
DROPPING OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE A STEADY FALL. HAVE               
GONE WITH READINGS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS ABOVE ZERO ACROSS THE WEST              
WITH 10-15 EAST OF THE CO/KS BORDER. THE COMBINATION OF THE WIND                
AND TEMPS WILL PRODUCE WIND CHILL READINGS IN THE -10 TO -15F                   
RANGE ACROSS FAR EASTERN COLORADO...CLOSE TO WIND CHILL ADVISORY                
CRITERIA. WILL ADDRESS THIS IN THE MORNING HWOGLD PRODUCT.                      
TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT...850 TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO FALL SOME                  
5-8F AS A DISTURBANCE MOVES INTO THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH OVER              
THE OHIO VALLEY....SLOWING THE WARMING THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY                      
EXPECTED. AM GONNA STICK CLOSE TO THE 850/2M COMBINATION FROM THE               
GFS/NAM/NGM/UKMET/SREF WHICH WOULD SUPPORT AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES               
ONLY IN THE 20S WITH PERHAPS SOME TEENS IN EASTERN COLORADO. WILL HAVE          
ANOTHER BLUSTERY/WINDY DAY AGAIN AS THE STRONGER WINDS UNDERNEATH               
THE UPPER JET MIX DOWN DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. BY 22-23Z WINDS              
WILL QUICKLY DECREASE TO UNDER 10 MPH. SOME CIRRUS MAY MOVE INTO                
THE SOUTHWEST 1/2 OR 1/3 OF THE AREA LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE                  
UPPER RIDGE AXIS CONTINUES ITS APPROACH TOWARD THE AREA. WINDS                  
WILL GRADUALLY BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST WITH PRETTY LIGHT SPEEDS. THE              
COMBINATION OF LIGHT WINDS AND A GENERALLY CLEAR SKY WILL PROMOTE               
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE NIGHT BEFORE                 
WARMER AIR ALOFT MOVES IN WITH THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS. MAY SEE                    
TEMPERATURES START TO INCREASE IN THE WEST AFTER MIDNIGHT. WILL GO              
FOR READINGS GENERALLY NEAR OR SLIGHTLY BELOW ZERO IN FAR EASTERN               
COLORADO TO THE SINGLE DIGITS ABOVE ZERO ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF                
THE AREA.                                                                       
WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY NIGHT...HAVE FOLLOWED THE COOLER                            
UKMET/ECMWF/GFS AT 850 AS THEY CAPTURE THE LOW LEVEL THERMAL                    
FIELDS BETTER WITH SNOW PACK STILL EXPECTED TO BE AROUND. THE NAM               
IS AT LEAST 15F WARMER THAN THE OTHER GUIDANCE PIECES AND HAS BEEN              
DISREGARDED. WITH THAT SAID...STILL PLANNING ON WARMING                         
TEMPERATURES INTO THE 30S...QUITE A BIT COLDER THEN PREVIOUSLY                  
EXPECTED. CIRRUS MAY BECOME RATHER THICK DURING THE TIME OF PEAK                
HEATING AS THE RIDGE AXIS MOVES ON TOP OF THE AREA. MIN TEMPS WILL

NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES PLANNED AT THIS TIME. 850 TEMPERATURES WILL              
CONTINUE TO WARM BUT MODEL AGREEMENT ON HOW FAST OR SLOW THIS                   
HAPPENS IS AT QUESTION. ADDITIONALLY...SNOW PACK WILL STILL BE A                
FACTOR FOR AT LEAST THE EARLY PORTION OF THE LONG TERM AND ITS                  
UNLIKELY THE MODELS WILL BE HANDLING IT WELL. MOS GUIDANCE IS                   
PRETTY MUCH WORTHLESS RIGHT NOW AS IT HAS NO CLUE TO THE SMALLER

MINOR BUT STILL WORTHY ADJUSTMENTS TO SNOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE                 
REST OF TONIGHT ARE COMING UP AS OUR HIGH POP LOW QPF SCENARIO

THE LEAD UPPER LEVEL DEFORMATION PATTERN BRUSHING OUR FAR EASTERN               
COUNTIES HAS A COUPLE MORE HOURS LEFT IN IT BEFORE FORCING                      
TRANSITIONS TO THE WAVE SHEARING EASTWARD FROM THE CHICAGO AREA.                
THIS SYSTEM WILL BRUSH THE DETROIT AREA BUT MAINLY AFFECT THE                   
INTERSTATE 69 CORRIDOR INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. ALL OF THIS                    
DYNAMIC FORCING IS ACTING IN A SIMILAR ENVIRONMENT OF LOW MOISTURE              
BUT ALSO LOW STATIC STABILITY OR EVEN SHALLOW LAYERS OF                         
INSTABILITY IN THE MID LEVELS AS SHOWN IN MODEL CROSS SECTIONS.                 
THE RESULTING MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BATTLE DRY AIR IN THE LOW               
LEVELS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TRI CITIES, FOR THE DURATION OF THE                   
EVENT.                                                                          
EXPECT THINGS TO TAPER OFF AROUND 3 AM AS THE UPPER WAVE SHEARS                 
TO OUR EAST. UNTIL THEN, WE WILL HANG ON TO CATEGORICAL POPS A                  
LITTLE FARTHER NORTH INTO FLINT AND A LONGER INTO THE NIGHT, BUT

THERE...JUST SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS. HIGHEST SNOW                              
ACCUMULATIONS...ONLY ABOUT AN INCH...ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THE

UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVING THROUGH THE CORN BELT THIS AFTERNOON WILL              
MOVE THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF NIGHT. WHILE              
MAIN SURFACE REFLECTION WILL STAY OVER THE CAROLINAS...PAST SEVERAL             
MODEL SUITES HAVE SHOWN A SECONDARY REFLECTION DEVELOPING OVER WEST             
VIRGINIA AND TRACKING UP THROUGH WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA DURING THE                
LATE EVENING. MSAS SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS DO                 
INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF THIS FEATURE...AND 12Z MODELS WERE                     
DEFINITELY TOO WEAK WITH IT. ALREADY SOME EVIDENCE OF A DEFORMATION             
BAND FORMING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM PER OBS AND SATELLITE             
IMAGERY...AND MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING THIS                   
DEFORMATION ZONE INTO SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN AFTER 00Z TONIGHT. SYSTEM              
WILL NOT HAVE MUCH TO WORK WITH AS JET DYNAMICS WILL REMAIN JUST TO             
OUR SOUTHEAST...AND NO DECENT INFLUX OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL                 
OCCUR. WILL SEE SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT HOWEVER...AND FORCING DOES LOOK            
TO BE CENTERED IN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE ALLOWING FOR MAXIMUM                
CRYSTAL GROWTH. OVERALL...LIKE THE RUC AND NGM QPF FIELDS THE BEST.             
DID HOWEVER LEAN TOWARDS THE HIGHER END OF THE MODEL QPF                        
FIELDS...GIVEN THAT THE MODELS ARE UNDERDONE WITH THE SYSTEM                    
INTENSITY. WITH THE LOW CENTER ALREADY SO FAR TO OUR EAST SNOWFALL              
WILL BE LIGHT AND FAIRLY SHORT IN DURATION...MOSTLY OCCURRING WITHIN            
A 4 TO 6 HOUR WINDOW THIS EVENING. PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE OUT OF               
SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN BY 4 AM.                                                     
IN THE WAKE OF THIS LITTLE SYSTEM...LOW CLOUDS AND MIST WILL LINGER             
THROUGH THE NIGHT. SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL ALSO BECOME ESTABLISHED LATE             
TONIGHT AS THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST                  
BECOMES BETTER ORGANIZED AND STARTS TO ADVANCE INTO THE WESTERN                 
GREAT LAKES.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS DEPICTING WEAK SHORTWAVE                   
ENERGY EJECTING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THIS                     
AFTERNOON. THIS ENERGY WILL ORGANIZE INTO A STRONGER SHORTWAVE                  
ACROSS THE PLAINS TONIGHT...AND EVENTUALLY INDUCE WEAK SFC                      
CYCLOGENESIS AS IT PULLS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY. MODEL                
TRENDS SINCE THE 00Z CYCLE HAVE BEEN TOWARD A WEAKER AND MORE                   
SOUTHERLY TRACK OF THE MAIN SFC LOW...WITH A SECOND WEAKER SFC                  
REFLECTION INDICATED WITHIN THE UNPHASED FLOW ACROSS SOUTHERN                   
CANADA. THE 12Z GFS...WITH SUPPORT FROM THE 12Z WRF-HEMI AND                    
CANADIAN...TAKES THE LOW FROM CENTRAL IL ACROSS NORTHERN IN AND                 
INTO LAKE ERIE. THE NAM REMAINS THE FURTHEST SOUTH...KEEPING A                  
STRONGER/MORE COMPACT LOW ACROSS SOUTHERN IN/NORTHEAST OHIO. THE                
12Z ECMWF APPEARS TO BE A GOOD COMPROMISE...MAINTAINING A                       
SLIGHTLY MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK THAN THE GFS...WHILE ALLOWING FOR                 
BETTER NORTHWARD EXPANSION OF THE MOISTURE/PCPN SHIELD INTO                     
SOUTHEAST LOWER MI COMPARED TO THE VERY DRY LOOKING NAM.                        
FORCING WILL BE LACKING INITIALLY...AND WILL PULL BACK ON POPS FOR              
THE MORNING HOURS.  HOWEVER...BY LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING THE                     
INCREASING LARGE SCALE ACCENT PROVIDED BY THE UPPER TROUGH AND WEAK             
LOW/MID LEVEL DEFORMATION WILL HELP OVERCOME A LIMITED MOISTURE                 
SOURCE TO BRING SNOW TO ALL OF SOUTHEAST LOWER MI.  MODELS INDICATE             
THE MAIN AXIS OF LARGE SCALE FORCING/OMEGA WILL EXIST JUST SOUTH OF             
THE STATE LINE...LEAVING THE HIGHEST QPF BANDS JUST OUT OF OUR                  
AREA.  HOWEVER...GIVEN THE ANTICIPATED LOW TRACK AND OVERALL                    
VERTICAL MOTION/MOISTURE FIELDS...A BROAD 1-2 INCH SWATH OF SNOWFALL            
STILL SEEMS PLAUSIBLE BY 06Z MONDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE               
SOUTHERN HALF.  THE POTENTIAL DOES EXIST FOR HIGHER AMOUNTS                     
APPROACHING 3 INCHES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO TIER OF COUNTIES...AND             
WILL NEED TO MONITOR FOR A POSSIBLE NORTHWARD ADJUSTMENT IN THE                 
TRACK AND BETTER FORCING. WHERE GOOD SYNOPTIC FORCING LACKS ACROSS              
THE THUMB REGION...SOME ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL MAY COME FROM LAKE                  
EFFECT ENHANCEMENT. THE ONLY AREA THAT MAY STRUGGLE TO SEE MUCH                 
SYNOPTIC ACCUMULATION WILL BE IN THE SAGINAW VALLEY...AND WILL                  
SCALE BACK QPF/SNOW AMOUNTS SLIGHTLY HERE.                                      
12Z MODEL SUITE REMAIN IN STRONG AGREEMENT AND CARRY GOOD RUN TO RUN            
CONTINUITY WITH THE PATTERN EVOLUTION BY MIDWEEK.  THE WEAKER SYSTEM            
LIFTING THROUGH MONDAY WILL LEAD IN A STRONGER SHORTWAVE FOR                    
TUESDAY...WITH THIS ENERGY CARVING OUT A DEEPER LONGWAVE TROUGH AND             
ALLOWING A BRIEF SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR TO SPILL IN FOR TUESDAY NIGHT/              
WEDNESDAY. STRENGTHENING COLD AIR ADVECTION ON TUESDAY WITH 850 MB              
TEMPERATURES DROPPING BELOW -10C WILL CREATE MARGINALLY FAVORABLE               
CONDITIONS FOR LAKE ENHANCED SNOW SHOWERS DURING THE DAY. THE                   
LATEST GFS INDICATING A NARROW CONVERGENCE ZONE DEVELOPING ACROSS               
THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE THUMB...WITH A SMALL WINDOW OF                       
PREDOMINANT NORTH-NORTHEAST FLOW OVER LAKE HURON INCREASING THE                 
POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER SNOW AMOUNTS IN THESE LOCATIONS LATE TUESDAY.              
MORE ORGANIZED ACTIVITY WILL DEVELOP BY TUESDAY EVENING AREAWIDE                
AS FORCING/CONVERGENCE INCREASES ALONG THE ARCTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY              
DROPPING SOUTH ACROSS SOUTHERN MI...AND LIKELY POPS REMAIN                      
APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PERIOD. OVERALL...ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS UP              
TO 2 INCHES (HIGHEST NORTH) STILL SEEMS REASONABLE AREAWIDE...WITH              
LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN THE FAVORED LAKE                  
ENHANCED AREAS ACROSS THE THUMB.                                                
ARCTIC AIRMASS WILL SETTLE OVERHEAD BRIEFLY FOR WEDNESDAY...WITH                
LINGERING SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS.  BASED ON PROJECTED 850 MB/                   
THICKNESS TRENDS...TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY HOLD STEADY OR SLOWLY               
FALL...AND NOT REACH MUCH ABOVE THE LOWER 20S.  AT LEAST PARTIAL                
CLEARING WEDNESDAY NIGHT...COMBINED WITH A WEAKENING GRADIENT WITH              
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY...WILL BRING THE                  
COLDEST NIGHT OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  GOING FORECAST WITH LOWS                 
BOTTOMING OUT IN THE 5-10F RANGE STILL LOOKING GOOD FOR THURSDAY                
MORNING.                                                                        
BIG PATTERN CHANGE FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...AS              
MODEL CONSENSUS PLACES THE GREAT LAKES WITHIN AN INCREASINGLY DEEP              
SOUTHWEST FLOW...BETWEEN STRENGTHENING RIDGING ACROSS THE EAST COAST            
AND A LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN THIRD OF THE CONUS.  THIS                
WILL LEAD TO A PRONOUNCED WARMUP BY THE WEEKEND...WITH 850 MB TEMPS             
CLIMBING INTO THE 5-10C RANGE BY SUNDAY.  IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO             
SCOUR OUT THE ARCTIC AIR INITIALLY...AND WILL CONTINUE TO TEMPER THE            
WARMUP ON THURSDAY...AS THE COLD MORNING START AND SNOW COVER                   
POTENTIAL WILL CERTAINLY COUNTER ANY INCREASE IN WARM AIR ADVECTION/            
RISING THICKNESSES.   HOWEVER...BY THE WEEKEND EXPECT TEMPERATURES              
TO CLIMB WELL ABOVE NORMAL...WITH HIGHS ON SUNDAY POTENTIALLY                   
APPROACHING 50F ACROSS THE SOUTH. INCREASING ISENTROPIC ACCENT AND              
THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL BRING THE NEXT CHANCE OF PCPN              
BY SATURDAY...WITH THE THERMAL PROFILES LOOKING MORE LIKE ALL                   
RAIN.

LESS THAN AN INCH OF ACCUMULATION THROUGH 12Z MAINLY SOUTH OF                   
INTERSTATE 80...WITH MOST AREAS RECEIVING JUST A DUSTING DUE TO                 
LACK OF GOOD MOISTURE. FORCING IS QUICK TO MOVE EAST OF THE                     
FORECAST AREA BY 18Z AS UPPER SHORTWAVE DIGS INTO NRN MO. ANOTHER               
WEAK WAVE BEHIND THIS INITIAL WAVE IS QUICK TO MOVE INTO NERN NEB               
THIS AFTERNOON AND COULD SUPPORT ENOUGH LIFT TO PRODUCE AREAS OF                
LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF FORECAST AREA.               
HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED POPS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS OF THE                    
FORECAST DUE TO LACK OF PROLONGED FORCING AND MOISTURE. AT THE                  
SFC...COLD FRONT DRAPED ACROSS CNTRL NEB WL CONTINUE TO MOVE EWD                
TODAY. BEHIND THE BOUNDARY...DESCENT MIXING IS TAKING PLACE AND SO              
HAVE BOOSTED HIGHS FOR TODAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS.                               
SFC PRESSURE GRADIENT WL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE DAY                
AS 1050MB HIGH BUILDS OVER THE COLORADO ROCKIES. MEANWHILE...500MB

THIS WL DRAG ARCTIC FRONT DOWN WITH POCKET OF -20C 850MB AIR. A FEW             
FLURRIES ARE CERTAINLY POSSIBLE WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE TROF                    
HOWEVER AIRMASS REMAINS QUITE DRY AND SO DOUBTFUL OF ANY                        
ACCUMULATING SNOW. WITH A CONTINUED STRONG SFC GRADIENT AND 850MB               
WINDS NEAR 40-50KTS...WL SEE SOME VERY COLD TEMPS AND WIND CHILL

THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS A BAND OF SNOW MOVING THROUGH SE NEB               
THIS MRNG.  THIS COULD PRODUCE BRIEF IFR VSBY AT LNK THROUGH 13Z.               
MEASURABLE SNOW IS UNLIKELY FOR ANY OF THE SITES AFTER THIS.                    
HOWEVER...INCREASING NW WINDS WILL BRING A STRENGTHENING PUSH OF                
ARCTIC AIR ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTN AND TNGT. THIS WILL LIKELY                 
PRODUCE SOME MVFR STRATOCU CIGS AND SCT SNOW SHWRS WITH MINOR VSBY              
REDUCTIONS.  SFC WINDS WILL STRENGTHEN TO 17-25KT BY ARND 18Z AND               
REMAIN IN THAT RANGE THROUGH 12Z FRI.  A FEW GUSTS 30-35 KT ARE

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL OF THE FORECAST AREA                  
THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. COLD FRONT HAS STALLED TO OUR SOUTHEAST              
ACROSS THE CENTRAL FL PENINSULA THIS MORNING. HAVE MADE A FEW MINOR             
ADJUSTMENT TO THE FORECAST...ESPECIALLY OVER THE EASTERN FLORIDA BIG            
BEND. ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS IS SHOWING INCREASING UPGLIDE ALONG THE               
295-300K SURFACES THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING TO THE NORTH              
OF THE SURFACE BOUNDARY. CONDENSATION PRESSURE DEFICITS BELOW AROUND            
700MB ARE QUITE LOW RESULTING IN ONLY WEAK LIFT NEEDED TO REACH                 
SATURATION. IN ADDITION...RUC IS SHOWING A WEAK DISTURBANCE BETWEEN             
500-300MB CROSSING THE NORTHERN GULF WHICH SHOULD HELP ADD                      
A SMALL AMOUNT OF SYNOPTIC LIFT TO THE PICTURE OVER THESE AREAS.                
THIS DISTURBANCE COULD BE SEEN EARLIER THIS MORNING CROSSING THROUGH            
SOUTHEAST TEXAS WITH A SLIGHT BACKING IN THE PROFILER WIND DATA.                
CROSS SECTION FORECASTS FROM JUST SOUTHEAST OF KTLH TO KCTY LATER               
TODAY INTO AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF THE EVENING ARE SHOWING A                 
FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE OMEGA BULLSEYE IN THE LOWER LEVELS. WHILE IMPACTS             
ARE EXPECTED TO BE MINOR...CAN NOT RULE OUT A FEW SHOWERS/SPRINKLES             
SOUTH AND EAST OF A LINE FROM KAAF TO KTLH IN ADDITION TO SKIES                 
REMAINING MOSTLY CLOUDY. WITH THE CLOUDS AND SOME LIGHT PRECIP                  
POSSIBLE ALSO LOWERED HIGHS ACROSS THIS AREA BY A COUPLE OF                     
DEGREES...MAINLY DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE 60S. LIFT RAPIDLY DIMINISHES              
BY THE LATER EVENING HOURS AND HAVE ALL SHOWERS/SPRINKLES ENDING BY             
MIDNIGHT (LIKELY A BIT EARLIER FROM KAAF TO KTLH).                              
FORECAST ATTENTION WILL THEN SHIFT TO THE APPROACH OF A STRONG                  
ARCTIC COLD FRONT LATER TONIGHT FROM THE NORTHWEST. LATEST GUIDANCE             
BRINGS THE FRONT TO AROUND KDHN AND KABY AROUND 09Z AND THEN EXITS              
THE FRONT SOUTH OF THE COASTAL WATERS AND KCTY BETWEEN 14-15Z                   
TUESDAY MORNING. ALTHOUGH HIGHS WILL STILL BE IN THE 50S ON TUESDAY             
WITH THE COLDEST AIR NOT ARRIVING UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT...GUSTY                   
NORTHWEST WINDS WILL MAKE IT FEEL COOLER.                                       
LATEST GUIDANCE IS SHOWING 850MB TEMPS DROPPING TO BETWEEN -8 AND               
-13C FROM SOUTH TO NORTH BY SUNRISE WEDNESDAY MORNING. THIS IS A                
FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE COLD AIRMASS FOR OUR NECK OF THE WOODS. LOOKING AT            
IT STATISTICALLY...THESE 850MB TEMPS ARE -4.0 TO -4.5 STANDARD                  
DEVIATIONS FROM CLIMATOLOGY. TO PUT THIS IN PLAIN WORDING...A 4.0               
STANDARD DEVIATION EVENT HAS A LESS THAN A ONE HALF PERCENT (< 0.5%)            
PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE. SO...ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN                 
COLDER AIRMASS IN THE PAST...THIS IS STILL A VERY RARE OCCURRENCE.              
LOOKING FOR A WIDESPREAD ADVECTION FREEZE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO                    
WEDNESDAY MORNING AND WILL MONITORING CLOSELY FOR POSSIBLE HARD                 
FREEZE CONDITIONS...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA.              
WITH THE LOWER LEVEL ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN AS COLD AS EXPECTED ON                  
WEDNESDAY...CURRENT FORECAST HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE 40S MAY BE ON THE              
OPTIMISTIC SIDE AND WILL TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THESE HIGHS WITH THE              
AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE.

NORTHEAST FLOW OVER THE FORECAST WATERS BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS                 
SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON BEFORE SETTLING DOWN TO                
AROUND 10 KNOTS. FLOW WILL COME AROUND BY LATE THIS EVENING TO THE              
WEST AND NORTHWEST BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS IN ADVANCE OF A STRONG               
ARCTIC COLD FRONT. THIS FRONT PUSHES THROUGH THE WATERS TUESDAY                 
MORNING WITH WIND AND SEAS RAPIDLY BUILDING TO ADVISORY LEVELS FOR              
ALL LEGS. AS STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS DOWN INTO THE SOUTHERN                 
PLAINS TO OUR WEST THE COMBINATION OF A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT AND             
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL INCREASE WINDS EVEN FURTHER TUESDAY              
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT WITH SUSTAINED FLOW BETWEEN 25 AND 30 KNOTS               
POSSIBLE OVER A LARGE AREA. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT GUSTS...OR EVEN            
FREQUENT GUST TO GALE FORCE WILL OCCUR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY             
MORNING. ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS AND SEAS WILL CONTINUE INTO WEDNESDAY             
NIGHT BEFORE SUBSIDING TO THE CAUTIONARY RANGE DURING THURSDAY AS

.UPDATE...FAIRLY QUIET DAY ON TAP THROUGHOUT NORTHERN MICHIGAN...               
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LINGERING LAKE EFFECT BAND ALONG/SOUTH OF THE             
STRAITS WHICH REMAINS THE PRIMARY FORECAST CHALLENGE. BAND REALLY               
WENT TO TOWN OVERNIGHT OWING TO ONSET OF DEEP SYNOPTIC MOISTURE IN              
ADVANCE OF WEAK SHORTWAVE PROGRESSING THROUGH WISCONSIN AS WELL AS              
PRONOUNCED 1000-850MB CONVERGENCE AXIS RUNNING THE LENGTH OF THE

FLOW PER EARLY MORNING ONSET OF LAND BREEZE AS WELL AS PASSAGE OF               
WEAK UPPER WAVE AND LOSS OF -DIVQ. HOWEVER...OVERALL SFC FLOW                   
REMAINS QUITE CONVERGENT PER RECENT OBS AND LATEST RUC/NAM PROGS                
THROUGH 18Z...AND WITH DELTA T/S MORE THAN SUFFICIENT (MID TEENS)               
AND INVERSION HEIGHTS NEARLY NON-EXISTENT IN THE PRESENCE OF STEEP              
LAPSE RATES (850-500MB RATES RUNNING SOME 7.5C/KM)...FORESEE NO                 
REASON WHY SOME WEAK LAKE BANDING WON/T CONTINUE INTO THE AFTERNOON             
FOR THE TIP OF THE MITT COUNTIES.  THUS GOING ADVISORY LOOKS LIKE A             
GOOD DEAL AS A FEW SPOTS (MAINLY EMMET COUNTY) COULD PICK UP A                  
COUPLE FRESH INCHES INTO EARLY AFTERNOON BEFORE OVERALL PARAMETERS              
ON THE DECLINE PER INFLUX OF SLIGHTLY WARMER AIR ALOFT AND SHIFTING

ELSEWHERE...EARLY MORNING SYNOPTIC SNOW JUST ABOVE OVER AS WEAK                 
280-285K ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE WEAKENING WITH THE PASSAGE OF VORT AND              
DEPTH OF MOISTURE SHALLOWING. GIVEN LATEST RADAR TRENDS WILL JUST               
CALL IT FLURRIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION            
OF EASTERN UPPER WHERE WILL MAINTAIN SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW WITH                  
MOISTURE DEPTH HOLDING FIRM PER FORECAST RAOBS. OTHERWISE...A MAINLY

DISCUSSION...NEW LONG WAVE TROUGH DIGGING TOWARD 150W EARLY THIS                
MORNING WILL SET THE STAGE FOR A SHOT OF COLD AIR FOR THE WESTERN               
LAKES TO USHER IN THE NEW YEAR.  THIS COLD PERIOD WILL BE SHORT                 
LIVED HOWEVER...WITH BIG TIME HEIGHT RISES AND SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW               
ALOFT SETTING UP FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK.  SO LOOKING AT A              
WARM UP AKIN TO WHAT OCCURRED DURING THE EXACT SAME TIME PERIOD ONE             
YEAR AGO.                                                                       
FORECAST PROBLEMS IN THE NEAR TERM WILL DEAL FIRST WITH A NASTY                 
LOOKING SNOW BAND OVER NORTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN.  FOCUS THEN TURNS TO             
TWO SHORT WAVES ROTATING THROUGH MEAN CENTRAL NORTH AMERICAN MEAN               
TROUGH POSITION.  ONE WAVE SLIDING INTO NE/KS EARLY THIS MORNING...             
AND WILL ZIP THROUGH THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT.  WILL NEED TO               
EVALUATE SNOW THREAT WITH THIS SYSTEM...EVEN THOUGH THE BULK OF THE             
EFFECTS WILL BE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.  A SECOND WAVE SPINNING             
ITS WAY OUT OF NORTHERN MANITOBA PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WILL DIG               
SOUTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND MID ATLANTIC IN THE TUESDAY/                 
WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME AS LONG WAVE TROUGH CONTINUES TO TRANSLATE                 
EASTWARD.  THIS LATTER WAVE WILL HELP PULL COLDER AIR ACROSS THE                
GREAT LAKES THROUGH THE MIDWEEK PERIOD...AND WILL GET THE LAKE                  
EFFECT MACHINE GOING AGAIN LATER TUESDAY INTO MIDWEEK.  FORECAST                
EVOLUTIONS IS SOMEWHAT COMPLEX WITH DECENT POTENTIAL FOR SNOWFALL               
TUESDAY. MORE ON THAT BELOW.                                                    
TODAY/TONIGHT...AT THE ONSET THIS MORNING...LIGHT SNOW AND FLURRIES             
WERE FALLING ACROSS NORTHERN LOWER...WITH A FOCUSED AREA OF                     
CONVERGENCE RESULTING IN A STRONG SNOW BAND OVER NORTHERN LAKE                  
MICHIGAN FROM THE MANITOU AND FOX ISLANDS NORTHEAST INTO THE STRAITS            
AREA.  RADAR RETURNS ARE IMPRESSIVE...WITH POCKETS OF 30-35 DBZ                 
RETURNS WITH RADAR ESTIMATES OF 1-2 INCH/HOUR SNOWFALL RATES.                   
FORTUNATELY...MUCH OF THIS IS OFFSHORE THOUGH THE NORTHERN END IS               
POKING INTO SOUTHERN MACKINAC COUNTY.  THIS BAND IS ACTUALLY JUST               
THE NORTHER END OF A BAND THAT SNAKES ITS WAY BACK INTO SOUTHERN                
LAKE MICHIGAN...WITH RADAR INDICATIONS OF ONE OR MORE MESOSCALE                 
VORTICES SPINNING ALONG THIS LINE OF CONVECTION ACROSS CENTRAL AND              
SOUTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN.  ON THE LARGE SCALE...SYNOPTIC LIGHT SNOW               
ASSOCIATED WITH NORTHERN FRINGES OF SMALL SCALE VORT CENTER NOTED ON            
WATER VAPOR SLIDING ACROSS FAR SOUTHERN LOWER...PROBABLY SOME                   
CONTRIBUTION FROM ANOTHER MID LEVEL WAVE OVER CENTRAL WI.  00Z UPPER            
AIR ANALYSES/SOUNDINGS SHOW DRIER AIR ACROSS IA/MO/IL THAT MOVE INTO            
LOWER MI LATER TODAY...WHICH COMBINED WITH LOSS OF FORCING SHOULD               
CONFINE CURRENT LIGHT SNOW PATTERN TO THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY FOR             
THE MOST PART.  IN ADDITION TO THE SYNOPTIC SNOW...REMNANTS OF THE              
SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED LAKE MICHIGAN BAND WILL BRING            
SOME BURSTS OF HEAVIER SNOW TO WESTERN LOWER FOR A TIME THIS MORNING            
AS THOSE CONVECTIVE ELEMENTS HEAD INLAND.  BIGGER QUESTION IS WHAT              
TO DO WITH THE BAND OVER NORTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN?  INDICATIONS ARE               
THAT CONVERGENCE WILL WEAKEN THIS MORNING AS LOW LEVEL FLOW FORECAST            
TO BECOME MORE UNIFORMLY SOUTHWEST.  BUT DOES APPEAR THAT THERE                 
COULD BE A SEVERAL HOUR WINDOW THIS MORNING WITH HEAVY SNOWFALL                 
RATES ACROSS PARTS OF CHARLEVOIX/EMMET/EXTREME NORTHERN CHEBOYGAN/              
SOUTHEASTERN MACKINAC COUNTIES.  EVEN AS THE MAIN BAND MOVES INLAND             
AND WEAKENS...SOUTHWEST FLOW LES PARAMETERS ARE NOT BAD EVEN WITH               
MARGINALLY WARM (AROUND -11C) 850MB TEMPERATURES.  LAPSE RATES ARE              
AT OR GREATER THAN MOIST ADIABATIC THROUGH 500MB...WITH FORECAST                
LAKE INDUCED CAPES A DECENT 400-450 J/KG THROUGH MIDDAY BEFORE                  
DROPPING DURING THE AFTERNOON AS 850MB TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO WARM            
AND INVERSION BECOMES A BIT BETTER DEFINED WITH WEAK DOWNWARD                   
FORCING.  GIVEN THIS THINKING...WENT AHEAD EARLIER AND PUT UP AN LES            
ADVISORY FOR THE ABOVE LISTED COUNTIES THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS.             
RAN WITH ACCUMULATIONS OF 3-7 INCHES FROM NOW THROUGH LATE                      
AFTERNOON.  WANTED TO GET SOMETHING OUT BEFORE THE HEAVIER SNOWFALL             
RATES MOVED IN  (WHICH WOULD HAVE OCCURRED PRIOR TO SCHEDULED                   
FORECAST ISSUANCE).  JUST ANOTHER NORTHERN MICHIGAN SNOW "FLASH                 
FLOOD" EVENT...                                                                 
FOR TONIGHT...ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON SHORT WAVE COMING OUT OF             
NE AS IT TRACKS ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY.  GUIDANCE TREND HAS BEEN A              
BIT FARTHER SOUTH WITH TIME...WITH A SURFACE LOW TRACK NOW ACROSS               
IN/OH/LAKE ERIE.  GIVEN THE PENCHANT FOR SYSTEMS TO END UP TRACKING             
FARTHER NORTH SO FAR THIS COLD SEASON...MIGHT END UP LOOKING FOOLISH            
TO SAY THAT THERE IS REASONABLE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL                
REMAIN FAR ENOUGH SOUTH TO OFFER JUST A GLANCING BLOW TO CENTRAL                
LOWER MI COUNTIES.  BUT THERE...I JUST WROTE IT.  AT THE VERY                   
LEAST...THE TREND HAS BEEN AWAY FROM US...UNLIKE IN PRIOR SYSTEMS               
WHERE THE TREND WAS FARTHER NORTH WITH TIME.  GIVEN THE CURRENT                 
TRACK OF THE WAVE...UNLESS SOMETHING FUNKY HAPPENS ALOFT...THE                  
NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY ROUTE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.  SOME QG FORCING                  
SPREADS INTO NORTHERN LOWER...BUT PROVIDED MID LEVEL DEFORMATION                
ZONE SETS UP ACROSS SOUTHERN LOWER AS FORECAST...THEN THE MAJORITY              
OF THE ACTION WILL STAY OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA.  WILL CARRY                   
HIGHEST POPS EAST OF AN APN-HTL LINE...CLOSEST TO PASSING SYSTEM TO             
THE SOUTH AND ACKNOWLEDGING POTENTIAL FOR SOME SHALLOW LAKE HURON               
LES TO GET GOING OVERNIGHT AS WINDS TAKE ON AN EASTERLY COMPONENT.              
NEW YEAR`S DAY TUESDAY...AS SURFACE LOW PULLS AWAY FROM LAKE ERIE...            
TROUGH AXIS WILL BE HANGING BACK ACROSS LOWER MI...EVENTUALLY                   
TURNING INTO THE LEADING EDGE OF THE COLD AIR DROPPING IN FROM                  
ONTARIO. LINGERING DEEP MOISTURE AND CONTINUED STEEP LAPSE RATES                
THROUGH THE COLUMN WILL KEEP THE THREAT FOR SNOW GOING ACROSS THE               
FORECAST AREA. BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM MAY BE THE LAKE ENHANCEMENT...            
AND AM BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ON THE LAKE MICHIGAN SIDE.               
ALTHOUGH 850MB TEMPERATURES ARE SOMEWHAT MARGINAL (STILL AROUND                 
-11C)...STEEP LAPSE RATES YIELD NO REAL INVERSION (FORECAST LAKE                
INDUCED CAPES CLIMBING INTO THE 400-500 J/KG RANGE DURING THE                   
AFTERNOON)...DEEP LAYER MOISTURE PERSISTING...AND A FAIRLY                      
CONSISTENT WIND DIRECTION THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY (340 DEGREES OR SO)           
TARGETS AREAS ALONG/WEST OF US-131 FOR DECENT SNOWFALL. INVERTED                
TROUGH AXIS A COMPLICATING FACTOR...THOUGH NOT FORECAST TO SWEEP                
INTO CENTRAL LAKE MICHIGAN UNTIL LATE IN THE DAY. COULD END UP                  
WITH AN AREA OF CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS ALONG THE TROUGH AND                   
ENHANCES SNOWFALL POTENTIAL. AS FOR SNOW AMOUNTS...WILL START WITH              
HIGH END ADVISORY CRITERIA (4-6 INCHES) BUT AM CONCERNED ENOUGH                 
THAT BELIEVE A LAKE EFFECT SNOW WATCH IS WARRANTED FOR TUESDAY                  
INTO TUESDAY NIGHT FOR COUNTIES ALONG/WEST OF M-37. IF IT ENDS UP               
TRANSITIONING TO AN ADVISORY THAT IS FINE. INTERESTINGLY ONCE THE               
COLDER AIR ARRIVES TUESDAY NIGHT...INVERSION HEIGHTS BEGIN TO TANK              
AND WINDS WILL PROBABLY BE SOMEWHAT VARIABLE FROM NORTHEAST TO                  
NORTH FOR A TIME. ALSO PLAN ON CARRYING SOME LIGHTER ACCUMULATIONS              
ON THE LAKE HURON SIDE WITH NORTH- NORTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW ON

19Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RUC ANALYSIS SHOWING MUCH OF NORTH AMERICA               
STILL DOMINATED BY LONG WAVE TROUGHING. SOUTHERN STREAM MOISTURE HAS            
BEEN PUSHED EAST AND NOW IS STREAMING NORTHWARD FROM THE SE GULF OF             
MEXICO INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. STRONG SHORTWAVE EMBEDDED WITHIN              
THE LARGER SCALE TROUGH IS BEGINNING TO DIG SOUTH AND EAST ACROSS               
THE CENTRAL PLAINS/MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. SECONDARY PIECE OF                
SHORTWAVE ENERGY IS PUSHING RAPIDLY SOUTH INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS              
AND WILL JOIN FORCES WITH THE FIRST SHORTWAVE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS            
TO CARVE OUT A LARGER AND MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH            
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION.                                            
AT THE SURFACE...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN CONTROL OF THE

EAST OF A LINE FROM KAAF TO KTLH AND KVLD...ALTHOUGH ANY RAINFALL

COLD FRONT ARRIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT FROM THE NORTHWEST. LATEST                   
GFS/NAM GUIDANCE BRINGS THE FRONT TO AROUND KDHN AND KABY BETWEEN               
07-09Z AND THEN EXITS THE FRONT SOUTH OF THE COASTAL WATERS AND KCTY            
BY 14Z TUESDAY MORNING. ALTHOUGH HIGHS WILL STILL BE IN THE 50S ON              
TUESDAY UNDER PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WITH THE COLDEST AIR NOT             
ARRIVING UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT...GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS WILL MAKE IT               
FEEL COOLER. A DEEP TROUGH WILL HAVE CARVED OUT ACROSS THE EASTERN              
U.S BY SUNDOWN TUESDAY WITH THE TROUGH AXIS RUNNING THROUGH OUR                 
FORECAST AREA.                                                                  
LATEST GFS/ECMWF GUIDANCE IS SHOWING 850MB TEMPS DROPPING TO BETWEEN            
-7 AND -12C FROM SOUTH TO NORTH BY SUNRISE WEDNESDAY MORNING. 12Z               
NAM IS ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF DEGREES COOLER BUT IS AN OUTLIER                    
FROM THE GLOBAL MODELS AT THIS TIME. EITHER WAY...THIS IS A                     
FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE COLD AIRMASS FOR OUR AREA. LOOKING AT IT                      
STATISTICALLY...THESE 850MB TEMPS ARE AROUND -4.0 STANDARD                      
DEVIATIONS FROM CLIMATOLOGY. TO PUT THIS IN PLAIN WORDING...A 4.0               
STANDARD DEVIATION EVENT HAS A LESS THAN A ONE HALF PERCENT (< 0.5%)            
PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE. SO...ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN                 
COLDER AIRMASS IN THE PAST...THIS IS STILL A VERY RARE OCCURRENCE.              
LOOKING FOR A WIDESPREAD ADVECTION FREEZE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO                    
WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH MANY AREAS APPROACHING HARD FREEZE CRITERIA.             
FORECAST LOW TEMPS WILL BE BETWEEN 22 AND 28F DEGREES ALMOST                    
REGIONWIDE WITH NORTHERLY FLOW BRINGING THE VERY COLD AIR BASICALLY             
TO THE BEACHES. ALSO WITH THE SURFACE HIGH WELL TO THE WEST                     
RESULTING IN NORTHERLY FLOW PREVAILING THROUGH THE NIGHT...WIND                 
CHILL VALUES ARE LIKELY TO FALL INTO THE TEENS OVER A LARGE AREA.               
WITH TEMPS APPROACHING HARD FREEZE CRITERIA COMBINED WITH THE                   
EXPECTED EXTENDED DURATION OF TEMPS BELOW FREEZING WILL LIKELY HAVE             
A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND WILL ISSUE A HARD FREEZE WATCH FOR ALL                 
ZONES LATE TUESDAY NIGHT UNTIL LATE WEDNESDAY MORNING. REFER TO OUR             
HARD FREEZE WATCH PRODUCT (MIANPWTAE) TO BE ISSUED DURING THE LATE              
AFTERNOON...OR YOUR FAVORITE MEDIA OUTLET FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON            
THE IMPENDING FREEZE.                                                           
SURFACE RIDGE BEGINS TO SHIFT EASTWARD INTO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE                
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON WEDNESDAY WITH THE UPPER TROUGH BEGINNING TO              
PUSH OFF THE EAST COAST. WITH THE LOW LEVEL ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN AS               
COLD AS EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY...HIGH TEMPS ARE LIKELY TO ONLY RISE              
INTO THE LOWER 40S NORTH AND MIDDLE TO UPPER 40S SOUTH. THIS WILL BE            
DESPITE PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND A DECENT GRADIENT FOR                  
DAYTIME MIXING. IF FACT...WITH 850MB TEMPS STILL BETWEEN -10 AND                
-11C DURING THE AFTERNOON OVER SE AL/SW GA...EVEN THESE NUMBERS MAY             
BE A BIT OPTIMISTIC AND WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE A STATION OR              
TWO ACROSS OUR NORTHERN AREAS OF SE AL AND SOUTHWEST GEORGIA                    
STRUGGLE TO 40F.                                                                
SURFACE RIDGE MOVES TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BY LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.            
ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT A PERFECT POSITION...DO BELIEVE THE HIGH CENTER            
WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH AND THE GRADIENT RELAXED ENOUGH TO ALLOW                   
DECOUPLING. THE LOW LEVEL ATMOSPHERE WILL BE EXTREMELY DRY WEDNESDAY            
AFTERNOON INTO THURSDAY MORNING AND WHEN COMBINED WITH THE LIGHTER              
WINDS AND GENERALLY CLEAR SKIES...SHOULD RESULT IN GOOD RADIATIONAL             
COOLING CONDITIONS. ANOTHER WIDESPREAD HARD FREEZE IS BECOMING                  
LIKELY FOR ALL AREAS AWAY FROM THE IMMEDIATE COAST. AS WITH MOST                
RADIATIONAL COOLING SCENARIOS...THE SHORELINE IS LIKELY TO BE A FEW             
DEGREES WARMER...BUT EVEN HERE THIS WILL BORDER ON HARD FREEZE                  
CRITERIA AND CERTAINLY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SUB-FREEZING TEMPS DOWN             
TO THE WATERS EDGE. LOW TEMPS ARE ANTICIPATED TO FALL TO BETWEEN 20             
AND 25 DEGREES INLAND AND 25 TO 30 DEGREES AT THE SHORELINE. A FEW              
NORMALLY COLDER LOCATIONS MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE UPPER TEENS. MAV                  
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN THESE                   
FORECAST NUMBERS...HOWEVER THE MAV HAS HAD A COOL BIAS THIS WINTER              
SEASON...ESPECIALLY WITH RADIATIONAL COOLING EVENTS. WHAT SHOULD BE             
UNDERSTOOD IS THAT AN EXTENDED PERIOD 10+ HOURS OF SUB-FREEZING                 
TEMPS ARE POSSIBLE FOR MANY AREAS WEDNESDAY EVENING INTO THURSDAY               
MORNING. THIS WILL LIKELY HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS AROUND THE                   
REGION. ONCE AGAIN REFER TO OUR HARD FREEZE WATCH PRODUCT                       
(MIANPWTAE) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

THE ABOVE MENTIONED ARCTIC RIDGE WILL DOMINATE THE BEGINNING OF THE             
EXTENDED PERIOD AS THE SHARP UPPER LEVEL TROF REMAINS CARVED OUT                
OVER THE SE EARLY THURSDAY. THEREAFTER...LOW AMPLITUDE UPPER LEVEL              
RIDGING WILL STRETCH EASTWARD FROM TX TO FL AS THE ARCTIC HIGH                  
EVENTUALLY MOVES OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST BY SATURDAY. THIS WILL              
ALLOW RETURN FLOW TO SET UP OVER THE REGION WITH GRADUALLY                      
MODERATING TEMPERATURES. ALTHOUGH TEMPS WILL MODERATE... LOW LEVEL              
MOISTURE WILL BE EVEN SLOWER TO RETURN...WITH THE NEXT REASONABLE               
CHANCE FOR RAIN NOT EXPECTED UNTIL MID WEEK OF NEXT WEEK.

NORTHEAST FLOW OVER THE FORECAST WATERS AROUND 10 KNOTS WILL                    
CONTINUE INTO THIS EVENING. FLOW WILL COME AROUND LATE THIS                     
EVENING TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS IN ADVANCE            
OF A STRONG ARCTIC COLD FRONT. THIS FRONT PUSHES THROUGH THE WATERS             
EARLY TUESDAY MORNING WITH WIND AND SEAS RAPIDLY BUILDING TO                    
ADVISORY LEVELS FOR ALL LEGS. AS STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS DOWN               
INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO OUR WEST THE COMBINATION OF A TIGHT                 
PRESSURE GRADIENT AND STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL INCREASE WINDS             
EVEN FURTHER TUESDAY EVENING AND OVERNIGHT WITH SUSTAINED FLOW                  
BETWEEN 25 AND 30 KNOTS POSSIBLE OVER A LARGE AREA. IT IS VERY                  
POSSIBLE THAT GUSTS...OR EVEN FREQUENT GUST TO GALE FORCE WILL OCCUR            
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS AND SEAS             
WILL CONTINUE INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT BEFORE SUBSIDING TO THE

SCENARIO IS FOR PREVAILING VFR CONDITIONS AT ALL TERMINALS THROUGH

SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE...PRIMARILY IN THE                  
SHORT-TERM. FIRST ISSUE WILL BE SNOW CHANCES THIS AFTERNOON AND                 
EVENING...THEN MAIN CONCERN WILL BE THE WINDY AND COLDER CONDITIONS             
SETTLING INTO THE REGION FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.                             
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS LOW PRESSURE BEGINNING TO GET                     
ORGANIZED ACROSS SOUTHERN KANSAS...IN RESPONSE TO 140KT 300MB JET               
STREAK TRACKING THROUGH THE CENTRAL ROCKIES. PLENTY OF LOW AND                  
MID-LEVEL CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEVELOPING SYSTEM...HOWEVER               
LITTLE IN THE WAY OF PRECIP JUST YET.                                           
SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY                                            
00Z 31 DEC MODELS HAVE MADE AN ABRUPT SHIFT SOUTHWARD WITH THE                  
APPROACHING SYSTEM FOR LATER TODAY...NOW KEYING IN ON THE UPPER WAVE            
TRACKING ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS RATHER THAN THE ONE FURTHER                  
NORTH CLOSER TO THE CANADIAN BORDER. END RESULT...IS A STRONGER                 
AND MUCH FURTHER SOUTH SURFACE LOW. BOTH NAM-WRF/GFS ARE IN GOOD                
AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK OF THIS LOW...HOWEVER THE NAM-WRF IS                   
A TAD FURTHER SOUTH. BASED ON LATEST ANALYSIS...IT APPEARS NAM-WRF              
IS VERIFYING BETTER THAN THE GFS...SO WILL TREND TOWARD ITS                     
SOLUTION MOST CLOSELY. LOW PRESSURE CURRENTLY OVER KANSAS WILL                  
TRACK E/NE TO SAINT LOUIS BY 18Z...THEN TO NEAR TERRE HAUTE BY 00Z              
TUE. THIS PARTICULAR TRACK WOULD BRING THE BEST CHANCE FOR ACCUMULATING         
SNOW TO THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE KILX CWA...MAINLY ALONG AND              
NORTH OF I-72. FURTHER SOUTH...PRECIP WILL BE MUCH LIGHTER AND                  
MUCH MORE SCATTERED IN NATURE. HAVE ADJUSTED POPS ACCORDINGLY...WITH            
CATEGORICAL NORTH OF I-72 TAPERING DOWN TO JUST SLIGHT CHANCE                   
SOUTH OF I-70. MID AND LOW-LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WILL INITIALLY              
BE RATHER DRY...SO ONSET OF PRECIP WILL LIKELY BE DELAYED UNTIL                 
AFTERNOON IN MOST LOCATIONS. BASED ON NAM-WRF FORECAST SOUNDINGS...SNOW         
SHOULD BEGIN AT KPIA BETWEEN 18Z AND 21Z...THEN FURTHER EAST AND SOUTH          
AT BOTH KSPI AND KCMI BETWEEN 21Z AND 00Z.                                      
STRONG FRONTOGENETIC FORCING AND FAVORABLE UPPER DYNAMICS WILL                  
LEAD TO A PERIOD OF MODERATE SNOW THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.                   
DESPITE THESE FAVORABLE PARAMETERS...TOTAL DURATION OF SNOWFALL                 
WILL ONLY BE BETWEEN 4 AND 6 HOURS...WHICH WILL TEND TO LIMIT                   
ACCUMULATIONS. THINK NAM-WRF QPF FIELD IS OVERDONE...SO WILL TRIM               
VALUES BACK A BIT...RESULTING IN A SWATH OF ONE TO THREE INCH                   
SNOWFALL ALONG AND NORTH OF I-72. BASED ON EXPECTED TRACK OF THE                
850MB LOW...HEAVIEST SNOW OF BETWEEN 2 AND 3 INCHES WILL LIKELY                 
OCCUR ALONG AND NORTH OF A RUSHVILLE TO BLOOMINGTON LINE. FURTHER               
SOUTH...LITTLE OR NO SNOW WILL FALL ALONG AND SOUTH OF I-70 UNTIL               
LATER THIS EVENING WHEN MOISTURE WRAPS AROUND THE DEPARTING LOW                 
PRESSURE.                                                                       
ONCE LOW TRACKS INTO INDIANA...INCREASING NORTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL              
TRANSPORT MUCH COLDER AIR INTO CENTRAL ILLINOIS TONIGHT INTO                    
TUESDAY. PRESSURE GRADIENT AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS SUPPORT WINDS IN              
THE 15 TO 25 MPH RANGE...WITH GUSTS AOA 35 MPH AT TIMES. THIS                   
COULD CAUSE SOME PROBLEMS WITH BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW ACROSS                 
THOSE AREAS THAT PICK UP AN INCH OR TWO TODAY. IN ADDITION...STRONGLY           
CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT WILL AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED                    
SNOW-SHOWERS THROUGH TUESDAY. WILL HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYES ON A                   
RATHER VIGOROUS SHORT-WAVE DROPPING SOUTHWARD OUT OF CANADA AS                  
WELL...AS IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING SOME ENHANCED SNOWFALL TO               
PARTS OF THE AREA. MODELS ARE NOT YET DEPICTING THIS IN THEIR RH                
OR QPF FIELDS...HOWEVER IT IS SHOWING UP IN FORCING FIELDS ALOFT.               
WITH STRONG CAA IN PLACE...TEMPS ON TUESDAY WILL STRUGGLE TO RISE               
FROM EARLY MORNING LOWS. HIGHS WILL RANGE FROM THE TEENS                        
NORTHWEST...TO THE MIDDLE 20S FAR SOUTHEAST. VERY COLD CONDITIONS               
WILL BE ON TAP TUESDAY NIGHT...HOWEVER CLOUD COVER AND WIND SHOULD              
KEEP READINGS FROM COMPLETELY BOTTOMING OUT. EVEN STILL...LOWS                  
WILL DIP INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS AND TEENS ACROSS THE BOARD. STRONG              
HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OVERHEAD ON WEDNESDAY...RESULTING IN CLEARING               
SKIES AND DIMINISHING WINDS.                                                    
LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY

16Z WATER VAPOR IMAGERY/RUC ANALYSIS INDICATED LONGWAVE TROUGH                  
ACROSS MUCH OF THE CONUS...WITH RIDGING JUST OFF THE WEST COAST. 12Z            
RAOB DATA INDICATED A FEW 150KT JET STREAKS EMBEDDED IN THE FLOW AT             
H3 WITH ONE LOCATED ACROSS SOUTHERN COLORADO AND ANOTHER ALONG THE              
EAST COAST. STRONG GRADIENT AT H7 WAS NOTED WITH -15C OBSERVED AT               
KDDC AND -6C AT KLMN...WHICH LINED UP FAIRLY WELL WITH AREA OF                  
CLOUDS THIS MORNING. AT THE SURFACE...COLD FRONT WAS WELL TO THE                
SOUTH OF THE CWA AND WAS LOCATED ACROSS CENTRAL TEXAS.                          
OVERALL MODELS INITIALIZED WELL ACROSS THE AREA AND DIFFERENCES WITH            
LARGE SCALE FEATURES APPEAR MINIMAL BETWEEN THE OPERATIONAL MODELS              
AT THIS TIME.                                                                   
TONIGHT...FIRST CONCERN FOR THE PERIOD WILL BE POTENTIAL...IF                   
ANY...FOR SNOW SHOWERS TO DEVELOP LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE                  
EVENING. KLBF SOUNDINGS SHOW FAIRLY STEEP LAPSE RATES OVER A GOOD               
DEPTH OF THE SOUNDING...WITH THETA-E LAPSE RATES BETWEEN H6 AND H5              
AROUND 0. GFS SHIFTS THIS POCKET OF POTENTIAL INSTABILITY TO THE                
SOUTH ACROSS NORTHERN FRINGE OF COUNTIES. IT IS INTERESTING THAT                
LAPSE RATES ARE STEEP ENOUGH THAT WARMING THE SURFACE TO THE LOWER              
30S WOULD BEGIN TO SUPPORT SFC BASED CONVECTION...ALTHOUGH IT WOULD             
BE VERY WEAK. ALTHOUGH STABILITY PROFILES LOOK FAVORABLE...FORCING              
APPEARS ABSENT AS SHORT WAVE TROUGH THAT IS CURRENTLY DROPPING                  
THROUGH THE DAKOTAS WILL NOT BEGIN TO IMPACT THE AREA UNTIL AROUND              
06Z AND MUCH OF THE FORCING FOR ASCENT WILL BE TO THE NORTH AND                 
EAST. PLAN TO MONITOR TRENDS THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE MAKING ANY FINAL             
CALL ON PRECIP POTENTIAL.                                                       
OTHER CONCERN FOR TONIGHT WILL BE WIND/TEMPS AND RESULTING WIND                 
CHILLS. AS MENTIONED BEFORE...STABILITY AHEAD OF THE NEXT TROUGH IS             
FAIRLY LOW AND SHOULD SEE A DECENT SURFACE RESPONSE AS TROUGH                   
APPROACHES. CONSENSUS OF RUC/NAM/GFS ALL KEEP WINDS UP THROUGH THE              
NIGHT AS PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS. WINDS STAYING UP ALL NIGHT MAY             
ALSO BE WHAT LIMITS WIND CHILL POTENTIAL AS WELL. WEST NORTHWESTERLY            
WINDS WILL KEEP LOWER BOUNDARY LAYER MIXED SOMEWHAT PREVENTING                  
STRONG DECOUPLING. WIND DIRECTION WILL BE OFF THE SNOWPACK WHICH MAY            
OFFSET THINGS...BUT ALL IN ALL EXPECT A SIMILAR DIURNAL SWING TO                
LAST NIGHT. CURRENT MIN TEMP THOUGHTS SEE THE WESTERN HALF OF                   
COLORADO COUNTIES GET TO -13 TO -17 WIND CHILLS...MAINLY ACROSS THE             
WESTERN HALF OF EASTERN COLORADO COUNTIES. ALTHOUGH THINGS ARE                  
MARGINAL...THINK A SHORT WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR THE MORNING IS IN              
ORDER.                                                                          
NEW YEARS DAY/EVENING...SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO THE SOUTH            
AND EAST OF THE AREA DURING THE MORNING HOURS AS LARGE SCALE RIDGING            
AND SUBSIDENCE MOVES INTO THE AREA. MAIN CONCERN FOR THIS PERIOD                
WILL BE WINDS THROUGH THE EARLY AFTERNOON. CWA...ESPECIALLY EASTERN             
CWA WILL HAVE STRONG HEIGHT/TEMP GRADIENT BETWEEN BUILDING RIDGE AND            
DEPARTING TROUGH...RESULTING IN AN AXIS STRONG WINDS ALOFT ACROSS               
THE AREA. MODELS DIFFER IN THE ACTUAL STRENGTH OF THE WINDS WITH NAM            
THE WEAKEST...GFS THE STRONGEST AND RUC IN THE MIDDLE. WOULD TEND TO            
FAVOR THE GFS AS IT HAS SEEMED TO PERFORM WELL LATELY SO WILL LEAN              
MORE IN THIS DIRECTION. GFS BUFR SOUNDINGS...ESPECIALLY IN THE EAST             
SHOW VERY WEAK SFC BASED INVERSION IN PLACE DURING THE MORNING DUE              
TO DEEP CAA BEHIND SHORTWAVE TROUGH...AND SUPPORT GUSTS AROUND 40KTS            
AND POSSIBLY SUSTAINED WINDS APPROACHING 28-30KTS AROUND 18Z. SINCE             
OTHER MODELS ARE NOT AS AGGRESSIVE WITH THE WINDS...WILL HEDGE BACK A           
BIT FROM THE GFS AND NOT ISSUE ANY KIND OF WIND ADVISORY BUT WILL               
HAVE GRIDS NEARING ADVISORY VALUES IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON.                      
SREF/NAM/GFS ALL CONTINUE TO SHOW A SHARP GRADIENT IN MAX TEMPS                 
ACROSS THE CWA...WITH COOLEST TEMPS ACTUALLY IN THE WARMER AIR MASS.            
GFS/NAM SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT WARMING ALOFT MAY BE TOO STRONG OUT              
WEST...PREVENTING MUCH OF A DEEPLY MIXED BOUNDARY LAYER TO DEVELOP.             
WITH REMAINING SNOW COVER THERE THAT MAY NOT BE UNREASONABLE...BUT              
WITH CHANGING AIRMASSES BUMPED UP TEMPS A BIT IN THE WEST. OUT                  
EAST...DEEPLY MIXED BOUNDARY LAYER SHOULD OFFSET COLDER TEMPS ALOFT             
AND THINK MAX TEMPS TOMORROW SHOULD ONLY BE A FEW DEGREES COLDER                
THAN TODAY.                                                                     
OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE ON THE DIFFICULT SIDE AS MODELS A             
BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN BRINGING IN THE WARMER AIR WITH AMPLIFYING               
RIDGE. THINK THAT CONDITIONS WILL BE PRETTY OPTIMAL FOR                         
COOLING...BUT AM UNSURE ON THE IMPACT THE WARMER AIR ALOFT WILL                 
HAVE. KEPT THE GENERAL IDEA OF PREVIOUS FORECAST BUT WARMED TEMPS               
SLIGHTLY.                                                                       
WED-THUR...LARGE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE AREA LEADING             
TO CONTINUED WARMING AND SUBSIDENCE ACROSS THE REGION. WEAK SHORT               
WAVE TROUGH SLIDES ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE ON THURSDAY                 
WHICH SHOULD BRING LITTLE MORE THAN INCREASING CLOUDS ACROSS THE                
AREA...AS POINT SOUNDINGS INDICATE A VERY STRONG AND DRY SUBSIDENCE             
INVERSION ACROSS THE REGION. WILL CONTINUE THE WARMING TREND THROUGH            
THE PERIOD...TEMPERED SOMEWHAT BY UNCERTAINTY OF SNOWCOVER IMPACTS.             
.EXTENDED (FRIDAY-MONDAY)...EC AND OPERATIONAL GFS IN GENERAL                   
AGREEMENT ON THE MEAN FLOW PATTERN DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD. THERE            
ARE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM IN TERMS OF STRENGTH AND TIMING             
OF SEVERAL SHORTWAVE TROUGHS SET TO MOVE THROUGH THE CWA DURING THE             
EXTENDED. WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF THE TWO FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE.            
FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL ON FRIDAY AS A LONGWAVE TROUGH STARTS TO                
AMPLIFY OVER THE WESTERN CONUS. WITH DRY SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AT THE              
SURFACE AND ALOFT AND H85 TEMPS APPROACHING +10C...FRIDAY MAX TEMPS             
IN THE LOW TO MID 50S SEEM REASONABLE. HAVE SLIGHTLY LOWER TEMPS                
GOING OVER THE COLORADO COUNTIES AS I FEEL FAIRLY CERTAIN THERE WILL            
BE ENOUGH RESIDUAL SNOWPACK TO HOLD TEMPS DOWN A FEW DEGREES THERE.             
FIRST IN THE SERIES OF SHORTWAVE TROUGHS WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA             
LATE SATURDAY BUT SHOULD BRING LITTLE MORE THAN A CHANGE IN WIND                
DIRECTION AND SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS FOR SUNDAY. GFS IS BRINGING THE             
SECOND ONE IN FOR SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY MORNING BUT FEEL IT MAY BE A              
LITTLE TOO PROGRESSIVE. WENT WITH THE SLOWER EC SOLUTION KEEPING                
PRECIP OUT OF THE GRIDS FOR NOW.                                                
FOR MONDAY...CURSORY GLANCE AT THE 12Z GFS SHOWS A POTENTIAL WINTER             
STORM FOR THE AREA. 295K ISENTROPIC SURFACE SHOWING STRONG UPGLIDE              
AND ADVECTION OF 6-8 G/KG MIXING RATIOS. THIS IS MORE IN LINE IN                
TERMS OF TIMING WITH THE 00Z/31 EC WHICH SHOWS A SIMILAR SOLUTION               
BUT KEEPS BEST FORCING...AND THEREFORE PRECIP...JUST TO THE NORTHWEST           
OF THE CWA. WILL NEED TO MONITOR THIS AND POSSIBLY INTRODUCE PRECIP             
IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF THE MODELS COME INTO CONSENSUS. REGARDLESS OF             
PRECIP...MONDAY MAX TEMPS WILL BE MUCH COOLER WITH H85 TEMPS OF                 
AROUND -3 TO -5C.

20Z WATER VAPOR LOOP AND RUC 500MB HEIGHT ANALYSIS SHOWED OVERALL               
BROAD TROUGHING ACROSS NORTH AMERICA...WITH A RIDGE BUILDING UP                 
ALONG THE IMMEDIATE WEST COAST. WITHIN THE BROAD TROUGH...THE MAIN              
FEATURES TO NOTE ARE A STRONG SHRTWV MOVING NE THROUGH MISSOURI...AN            
UPPER LOW OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA AND A SHRTWV OVER NE BRITISH                   
COLUMBIA. A WEAK SHRTWV IS ALSO NOTED OVER NE MN. ASSOCIATED WITH               
THIS SHRTWV AT THE SURFACE IS A 1009MB LOW OVER ISLE ROYALE...ALONG             
WITH SOME LIGHT SNOW OVER WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR INTO THE WESTERN                
U.P. AS NOTED ON RADAR AND SURFACE OBS. 850MB TEMPS NEAR AND UNDER              
THE UPPER LOW WERE CHILLY...BUT NOT UNSEASONABLE WITH READINGS AT               
12Z OF -14C AT INL...-15C AT CWPL AND -17C AT CYQD. SOUNDINGS FROM              
ALL THREE SITES ALSO DEPICTED PLENTY OF MOISTURE...WITH NEARLY                  
SATURATED CONDITIONS FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH 500MB. FARTHER                    
WEST...HIGH PRESSURE CAN BE SEEN BUILDING INTO TOWARDS THE PLAINS               
FROM THE WESTERN STATES...WITH A 1030-1040MB RIDGE STRETCHING FROM              
UTAH THROUGH ALBERTA. THE BACK SIDE OF THIS RIDGE IS WHERE WARMER               
AIR IS BUILDING UP...WHICH IS PROGGED TO HEAD EAST TOWARDS UPPER MI             
LATER THIS WEEK (SEE LONG TERM DISCUSSION FOR FURTHER DETAILS).                 
&&                                                                              
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUE NIGHT)...                                      
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS SNOWFALL AMOUNTS FROM THE UPCOMING LAKE                
EFFECT EVENT.                                                                   
TONIGHT...UPPER LOW OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA WILL DROP SE TOWARDS THE             
MINNEAPOLIS AREA BY 12Z...WHILE THE STRONG SHRTWV OVER MISSOURI                 
LIFTS INTO OHIO. GIVEN THE TRACK OF THE UPPER LOW...THE MAJORITY OF             
THE COLD AIR SEEN ON 12Z SOUNDINGS WILL BE SHUNTED SOUTHWARD RATHER             
THAN EASTWARD...BUT STILL SOME OF IT WILL MAKE IT ACROSS LAKE                   
SUPERIOR. BY 12Z TUE...MODELS HAVE 850MB TEMPS DROPPING TO -12 TO               
-16C...COLDEST OVER WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR CLOSER TO THE UPPER LOW.              
GIVEN THAT THIS AIR IS GENERALLY FLOWING FROM THE NW AND UPSTREAM               
SOUNDINGS ARE FAIRLY MOIST...THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT DRY                
AIR. HOWEVER...VERTICAL MOTION IS THE BIG QUESTION. SYNOPTICALLY                
SPEAKING...THE ONLY VERTICAL MOTION LOOKS TO OCCUR FROM THE SHRTWV              
OVER NE MN HEADING NE THIS EVENING. HAVE MAINTAINED SOME LOW CHANCE             
POPS ACROSS THE CWA FOR ANY LIGHT SNOW THAT THIS PRODUCES. GIVEN THE            
COLD AIR MOVING IN...THE OTHER SOURCE OF VERTICAL MOTION WILL BE THE            
INDUCED LAKE EFFECT. WITH THE SURFACE LOW OVER ISLE ROYALE PROGGED              
TO DROP SE...AND EVENTUALLY MERGE WITH THE SYSTEM HEADING UP TO                 
OHIO...A GENERAL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL SET UP FROM THUNDER BAY            
SE TO MUNISING. 950MB CONVERGENCE IS STRONGEST BEGINNING LATE THIS              
EVENING OVER THE WEST...IN PARTICULAR GOGEBIC AND ONTONAGON                     
COUNTIES. SOUNDINGS DEPICT IN THIS AREA THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL MOTION             
EVENTUALLY INTERSECTING THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE AFTER MIDNIGHT...             
SUGGESTING SOME DECENT SNOWFALL RATES SHOULD OCCUR. THUS THE GOING              
HEADLINES OUT THERE LOOK REASONABLE. THE REST OF THE U.P. MAY SEE               
SOME LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES AS CLOUDS STICK AROUND. THESE CLOUDS                
SHOULD HELP TO HOLD TEMPERATURES UP...WITH COLD ADVECTION THROUGH               
THE NIGHT THE MAIN FACTOR IN BRINGING READINGS DOWN. STAYED CLOSER              
TO WARMER GUIDANCE FOR LOWS.                                                    
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT...UPPER LOW WILL HEAD DOWN INTO INDIANA              
BY 00Z WED AND THEN TO VIRGINIA BY 12Z WED. THIS TRACK IS STILL NOT             
ALL THAT FAVORABLE TO BRING TOO MUCH COLD AIR DOWN...AND IT REALLY              
IS NOT UNTIL LATER TUE NIGHT WHEN THE SHRTWV OVER NE BRITISH                    
COLUMBIA MOVES DOWN INTO WESTERN WI...BRINGING AIR IN MORE SIMILAR              
TO ARCTIC ORIGIN. THIS IS GOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF LAKE EFFECT AS                
MUCH OF THE VERTICAL MOTION PRODUCED BY LATENT HEAT FLUXES WILL                 
INTERSECT THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE. THUS...THE AREAS OF 950MB                  
CONVERGENCE WILL DICTATE WHERE THE HEAVIEST SNOW FALLS. AT THE                  
SURFACE...THE LOW PRESSURE TROUGH FROM THUNDER BAY THROUGH MUNISING             
IS PROGGED TO SWING SOUTH. HOW QUICK THIS OCCURS WILL DETERMINE AT              
LEAST WHEN THE HEAVIER SNOW WILL GET INTO THE NORTH CENTRAL                     
U.P....SINCE WINDS TURN N TO NE BEHIND IT. THE GFS/CANADIAN ARE                 
SLOWER TO BRING THE TROUGH SOUTH COMPARED TO THE NAM/LOCAL                      
WRF-ARW...AND THUS HAVE DELAYED A BIT WHEN THE HEAVIER SNOW.                    
STILL...IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE A PERIOD FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON             
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING WITH HEAVIER SNOW IN MARQUETTE COUNTY. BOTH             
SCENARIOS STILL LOOK GOOD FOR THE GOING HEADLINES IN GOGEBIC AND                
ONTONAGON COUNTIES...WITH THE STRONGEST CONVERGENCE STILL FOCUSED               
DURING THE DAY INTO EARLY MORNING HOURS IN GOGEBIC. WINDS TURNING               
NORTH AND THEN NE ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR EITHER THE KEWEENAW OR                  
LUCE/NORTHERN SCHOOLCRAFT...THUS NO HEADLINES ARE REQUIRED. SNOWFALL            
RATIOS OF 25 TO 1 ARE EXPECTED...WITH THE WINDS KEEPING THE RATIOS              
FROM GOING HIGHER. THESE RATIOS COULD GET HIGHER THOUGH ON TUESDAY              
NIGHT...THANKS TO COLDER AIR AND LIGHTER WINDS...BUT SYNOPTIC                   
MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO DEPART. THUS...SNOWFALL SHOULD DIMINISH IN               
INTENSITY LATER TUESDAY EVENING. TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO ONLY              
CLIMB A FEW DEGREES ON TUESDAY DUE TO CONTINUED COLD ADVECTION...AND            
COULD FALL IN THE AFTERNOON. BROUGHT TEMPS UP A FEW DEGREES TUE                 
NIGHT DUE TO WINDS THAT APPEAR MORE NORTHERLY...RESULTING IN MORE               
CLOUD COVER.

TEMPS REMAIN NEAR -18C. THE LONGER FETCH AND GREATER INVERSION                  
HEIGHTS/MOISTURE DEPTH WILL BRING GREATER INTENSITY WITH LIGHT TO               
MODERATE ACCUMLUATIONS TO THE ERN CWA. OVER THE WEST...THE SHORTER              
FETCH LENGTH AND UPSTREAM DRYING FROM WRN LAKE SUPERIOR SHOULD                  
RESULT IN MAINLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS. AS THE RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE              
REGION WED NIGHT...WINDS WILL STEADILY BACK WITH LOW LEVEL FLOW                 
SHIFTING OFFSHORE FROM WEST TO EAST OVERNIGHT...ENDING ANY LES. A               
PERIOD OF DECOUPLED WINDS WITH CLEARING SKIES BEFORE SW FLOW                    
INCREASES LATE SHOULD ALLOS TEMPS TO FALL BLO GUIDANCE FOR INLAND

MOVES INTO THE WRN CONUS AND A BROAD/FLAT RIDGE EXPANDS INTO THE                
PLAINS AND GREAT LAKES. MDLS MOISTURE FIELDS SUGGEST THAT THE                   
AIRMASS WILL REMAIN TO DRY TO SUPPORT MEASURABLE PCPN.                          
FRI NIGHT INTO SAT...ENOUGH MOISTURE FINALLY MOVES TOWARD THE REGION            
WITH LOW LEVEL WINDS BACKING AND ALLOWING GULF MOISTURE TO MOVE                 
TOWARD THE REGION. 00Z ECMWF AND 12Z GFS PARTIAL THICKNESS FIELDS               
AND SOUNDINGS SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR SOME FREEZING DRIZZLE INTO SAT              
MORNING WITH A PERSISTENT 850-700 DRY LAYER. TEMP PROFILE WOULD BE              
BODERLINE FOR FROZEN PCPN BUT CANNOT RULE OUT SOME PATCHY LIGHT                 
SNOW AT THIS TIME. WAA AND DIUNRAL WARMING SHOULD KEEP ANY LIGHT                
PCPN AS LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE BY SAT AFTERNOON.

CONTINUITY WAS OBSERVED WITH THE TIMING/STRENGTH OF SHORTWAVES                  
MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. WHILE THE 00Z ECMWF WAS FASTER WITH                    
STRONGER LEAD SHORTWAVE THAN THE 06Z/12Z GFS THE 12Z ECMWF IS NOW               
SIGNFICANTLY SLOWER. EVEN THOUGH A PERIOD OF RAIN IS LIKELY DURING              
THIS PERIOD...ONLY CHANCE POPS WERE INCLUDED DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN              
WHEN IT MAY OCCUR. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN WELL ABOVE NORMAL WITH            
MIN READINGS ONLY APPROACHING FREEZING. SFC-700 MB TEMPS SUPPORT                
ONLY RAIN. SOME OF THE MODLE SOLUTIONS EVEN SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR               
TSTMS WITH A STRONG SRLY LOW LEVEL JET AND SHOWALTER VALUES AROUND 0

MVFR CEILINGS SHOULD PREVAIL THROUGH MUCH OF THE FCST PERIOD AT BOTH            
TAF SITES...DUE TO A COMBINATION OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ROTATING                 
AROUND LOW PRESSURE OVER ISLE ROYALE DROPPING SE AND LAKE EFFECT                
CLOUDS THAT DEVELOP TONIGHT. THE VISIBILITY FORECAST IS A LITTLE                
MORE TRICKY. FOR CMX...VSBYS SHOULD COME DOWN SHORTLY AS                        
OBSERVATIONS AND LATEST RADAR LOOP SHOW -SN WITH VSBYS OF MVFR OR               
IFR HEADING TOWARDS THERE. LAKE EFFECT SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD GET GOING            
IN THE WAKE OF THIS -SN EARLY THIS EVENING AS WINDS TURN NW. SINCE              
MODEL SOUNDINGS DO NOT LOOK TOO IMPRESSIVE WITH THE LAKE EFFECT                 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE NIGHT...ONLY LOW MVFR VSBYS WERE FORECAST. VSBYS            
ARE EXPECTED TO DROP TO IFR VERY LATE IN THE NIGHT AND REMAIN INTO              
TUE AS COLDER AIR COMBINES WITH INCREASING WINDS TO CREATE MORE                 
BLOWING OF THE SNOW. AT SAW...VSBYS MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO                 
DROP...SINCE -SN IS STILL MOVING NE THROUGH CENTRAL WI. STILL...AN              
MVFR VSBY LOOKS LIKELY LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. VSBYS SHOULD            
THEN IMPROVE THROUGH MUCH OF THE NIGHT WITH MUCH OF THE SNOW MOVING             
E OR NE OF THE AREA. LAKE EFFECT SNOW SHOWERS COMING OFF WESTERN                
LAKE SUPERIOR MAY BE ABLE TO DROP VSBYS TO MVFR LATE TONIGHT.                   
HOWEVER...THINK THE BETTER CHANCE FOR LOWER VSBYS WILL COME TUE                 
MORNING OR MORE LIKELY TUE AFTERNOON AS WINDS TURN TO THE

TONIGHT AND TUE. COLD AIR FLOWING IN AND PRESSURES RISING RAPIDLY

WINDS WILL DIMINISH BELOW 30 KT FOR TUE NIGHT THROUGH WED NIGHT AS A            
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CROSSES. BEHIND THIS HIGH...A TIGHTENING

EXCEPTION OF LINGERING LAKE EFFECT BAND ALONG/SOUTH OF THE STRAITS              
WHICH REMAINS THE PRIMARY FORECAST CHALLENGE. BAND REALLY WENT TO               
TOWN OVERNIGHT OWING TO ONSET OF DEEP SYNOPTIC MOISTURE IN ADVANCE

PRONOUNCED 1000-850MB CONVERGENCE AXIS RUNNING THE LENGTH OF THE

REASON WHY SOME WEAK LAKE BANDING WON/T CONTINUE INTO THE AFTERNOON             
FOR THE TIP OF THE MITT COUNTIES.  THUS GOING ADVISORY LOOKS LIKE A

TWO SHORT WAVES ROTATING THROUGH MEAN CENTRAL NORTH AMERICAN MEAN               
TROUGH POSITION.  ONE WAVE SLIDING INTO NE/KS EARLY THIS MORNING...

EVALUATE SNOW THREAT WITH THIS SYSTEM...EVEN THOUGH THE BULK OF THE             
EFFECTS WILL BE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.  A SECOND WAVE SPINNING             
ITS WAY OUT OF NORTHERN MANITOBA PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WILL DIG               
SOUTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND MID ATLANTIC IN THE TUESDAY/                 
WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME AS LONG WAVE TROUGH CONTINUES TO TRANSLATE                 
EASTWARD.  THIS LATTER WAVE WILL HELP PULL COLDER AIR ACROSS THE                
GREAT LAKES THROUGH THE MIDWEEK PERIOD...AND WILL GET THE LAKE

AIR ANALYSES/SOUNDINGS SHOW DRIER AIR ACROSS IA/MO/IL THAT MOVE INTO            
LOWER MI LATER TODAY...WHICH COMBINED WITH LOSS OF FORCING SHOULD               
CONFINE CURRENT LIGHT SNOW PATTERN TO THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY FOR             
THE MOST PART.  IN ADDITION TO THE SYNOPTIC SNOW...REMNANTS OF THE              
SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED LAKE MICHIGAN BAND WILL BRING            
SOME BURSTS OF HEAVIER SNOW TO WESTERN LOWER FOR A TIME THIS MORNING            
AS THOSE CONVECTIVE ELEMENTS HEAD INLAND.  BIGGER QUESTION IS WHAT              
TO DO WITH THE BAND OVER NORTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN?  INDICATIONS ARE               
THAT CONVERGENCE WILL WEAKEN THIS MORNING AS LOW LEVEL FLOW FORECAST            
TO BECOME MORE UNIFORMLY SOUTHWEST.  BUT DOES APPEAR THAT THERE                 
COULD BE A SEVERAL HOUR WINDOW THIS MORNING WITH HEAVY SNOWFALL                 
RATES ACROSS PARTS OF CHARLEVOIX/EMMET/EXTREME NORTHERN CHEBOYGAN/              
SOUTHEASTERN MACKINAC COUNTIES.  EVEN AS THE MAIN BAND MOVES INLAND             
AND WEAKENS...SOUTHWEST FLOW LES PARAMETERS ARE NOT BAD EVEN WITH               
MARGINALLY WARM (AROUND -11C) 850MB TEMPERATURES.  LAPSE RATES ARE              
AT OR GREATER THAN MOIST ADIABATIC THROUGH 500MB...WITH FORECAST                
LAKE INDUCED CAPES A DECENT 400-450 J/KG THROUGH MIDDAY BEFORE                  
DROPPING DURING THE AFTERNOON AS 850MB TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO WARM            
AND INVERSION BECOMES A BIT BETTER DEFINED WITH WEAK DOWNWARD                   
FORCING.  GIVEN THIS THINKING...WENT AHEAD EARLIER AND PUT UP AN LES            
ADVISORY FOR THE ABOVE LISTED COUNTIES THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS.             
RAN WITH ACCUMULATIONS OF 3-7 INCHES FROM NOW THROUGH LATE                      
AFTERNOON.  WANTED TO GET SOMETHING OUT BEFORE THE HEAVIER SNOWFALL             
RATES MOVED IN  (WHICH WOULD HAVE OCCURRED PRIOR TO SCHEDULED                   
FORECAST ISSUANCE).  JUST ANOTHER NORTHERN MICHIGAN SNOW "FLASH                 
FLOOD" EVENT...                                                                 
FOR TONIGHT...ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON SHORT WAVE COMING OUT OF

BIT FARTHER SOUTH WITH TIME...WITH A SURFACE LOW TRACK NOW ACROSS               
IN/OH/LAKE ERIE.  GIVEN THE PENCHANT FOR SYSTEMS TO END UP TRACKING             
FARTHER NORTH SO FAR THIS COLD SEASON...MIGHT END UP LOOKING FOOLISH            
TO SAY THAT THERE IS REASONABLE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL                
REMAIN FAR ENOUGH SOUTH TO OFFER JUST A GLANCING BLOW TO CENTRAL                
LOWER MI COUNTIES.  BUT THERE...I JUST WROTE IT.  AT THE VERY                   
LEAST...THE TREND HAS BEEN AWAY FROM US...UNLIKE IN PRIOR SYSTEMS               
WHERE THE TREND WAS FARTHER NORTH WITH TIME.  GIVEN THE CURRENT                 
TRACK OF THE WAVE...UNLESS SOMETHING FUNKY HAPPENS ALOFT...THE                  
NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY ROUTE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.  SOME QG FORCING                  
SPREADS INTO NORTHERN LOWER...BUT PROVIDED MID LEVEL DEFORMATION                
ZONE SETS UP ACROSS SOUTHERN LOWER AS FORECAST...THEN THE MAJORITY              
OF THE ACTION WILL STAY OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA.  WILL CARRY                   
HIGHEST POPS EAST OF AN APN-HTL LINE...CLOSEST TO PASSING SYSTEM TO             
THE SOUTH AND ACKNOWLEDGING POTENTIAL FOR SOME SHALLOW LAKE HURON               
LES TO GET GOING OVERNIGHT AS WINDS TAKE ON AN EASTERLY COMPONENT.              
NEW YEAR`S DAY TUESDAY...AS SURFACE LOW PULLS AWAY FROM LAKE ERIE...            
TROUGH AXIS WILL BE HANGING BACK ACROSS LOWER MI...EVENTUALLY                   
TURNING INTO THE LEADING EDGE OF THE COLD AIR DROPPING IN FROM                  
ONTARIO. LINGERING DEEP MOISTURE AND CONTINUED STEEP LAPSE RATES                
THROUGH THE COLUMN WILL KEEP THE THREAT FOR SNOW GOING ACROSS THE               
FORECAST AREA. BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM MAY BE THE LAKE ENHANCEMENT...            
AND AM BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ON THE LAKE MICHIGAN SIDE.               
ALTHOUGH 850MB TEMPERATURES ARE SOMEWHAT MARGINAL (STILL AROUND                 
-11C)...STEEP LAPSE RATES YIELD NO REAL INVERSION (FORECAST LAKE                
INDUCED CAPES CLIMBING INTO THE 400-500 J/KG RANGE DURING THE

WITH AN AREA OF CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS ALONG THE TROUGH AND                   
ENHANCES SNOWFALL POTENTIAL. AS FOR SNOW AMOUNTS...WILL START WITH              
HIGH END ADVISORY CRITERIA (4-6 INCHES) BUT AM CONCERNED ENOUGH                 
THAT BELIEVE A LAKE EFFECT SNOW WATCH IS WARRANTED FOR TUESDAY                  
INTO TUESDAY NIGHT FOR COUNTIES ALONG/WEST OF M-37. IF IT ENDS UP               
TRANSITIONING TO AN ADVISORY THAT IS FINE. INTERESTINGLY ONCE THE               
COLDER AIR ARRIVES TUESDAY NIGHT...INVERSION HEIGHTS BEGIN TO TANK              
AND WINDS WILL PROBABLY BE SOMEWHAT VARIABLE FROM NORTHEAST TO

SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE LATEST RUC MODEL ANALYSIS INDICATES THE                  
HIGHEST PROBABILITY FOR SNOW SHOWERS TODAY WILL LIE ACROSS THE                  
SEELEY LAKE REGION AND OVER THE CLEARWATER/BITTERROOT MOUNTAINS                 
ALONG THE IDAHO/MONTANA BORDER. I ALSO RAISED THE CHANCE FOR                    
PRECIPITATION UP THE SOUTHERN BITTERROOT VALLEY AS I BELIEVE THE                
SHOWERS WHICH DEVELOP OVER THE MOUNTAINS WILL OCCASIONALLY MOVE                 
OVER THE VALLEY. LITTLE IF ANY ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL IS EXPECTED

TUESDAY...STRONG RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL STABILIZE THE VALLEYS.                
SOME PATCHY FREEZING FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE VALLEYS AND                    
CANYONS. SOUTHEASTERLY PRESSURE GRADIENTS WILL BEGIN TO TIGHTEN                 
CONSIDERABLY ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...VALLEY LOCATIONS                  
SHOULD BE ABLE TO MIX OUT. ALTHOUGH THE PRESSURE GRADIENT                       
ORIENTATION IS NOT IDEAL FOR HIGH WINDS ON THE CAMAS PRAIRIE OF

OF AT LEAST A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE TUESDAY NIGHT-WEDNESDAY PERIOD.             
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...THE STRONG SOUTHERLY PRESSURE                  
GRADIENT SHOULD SCOUR OUT MUCH OF THE COLDER AIR TRAPPED IN THE                 
VALLEYS BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A WARM AIRMASS WILL BEGIN PUSHING INTO              
THE AREA FROM THE SOUTH AND TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM UP ON                      
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AND PUSH SNOW LEVELS ABOVE SOME VALLEY FLOORS.              
THURSDAY WILL BE RELATIVELY DRY WITH CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION                  
JUST ALONG THE IDAHO-MONTANA BORDER. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW BEGINS TO               
APPROACH OFF THE WASHINGTON COAST AND WILL PUSH MOISTURE AND                    
ENERGY OVER THE AREA AGAIN ON FRIDAY. THE CONTINUED SOUTHERLY FLOW              
FRIDAY WILL KEEP LOWER VALLEYS AS RAIN THROUGH THE DAY BUT CHANGE               
OVER TO SNOW BY SATURDAY AS A COLD FRONT SWINGS THROUGH OVERNIGHT.              
THE WET PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS THE UPPER

INDICATING A SURFACE LOW MOVING OVER THE SOUTHWEST MONTANA ON                   
MONDAY WHICH IS A GOOD SETUP FOR A SNOW EVENT ACROSS THE WEST

DISCUSSION...LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE IN THE                        
MOUNTAINS TODAY AS LINGERING MOISTURE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF LOW TO                 
MID LEVEL INSTABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND AN UPPER LEVEL JET                  
STREAM THAT WILL MOVE OVER WESTERN MONTANA THIS AFTERNOON.                      
PRECIPITATION WILL TAPER OFF OVERNIGHT AS AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE                  
PUSHES IN FROM THE WEST. AS SKIES CLEAR TOWARD DAYBREAK ON                      
TUESDAY...STRONG RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL STABILIZE THE VALLEYS.                
SOME PATCHY FREEZING FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE VALLEYS AND                    
CANYONS. SOUTHEASTERLY PRESSURE GRADIENTS WILL BEGIN TO TIGHTEN                 
CONSIDERABLY ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...VALLEY LOCATIONS                  
SHOULD BE ABLE TO MIX OUT. ALTHOUGH THE PRESSURE GRADIENT                       
ORIENTATION IS NOT IDEAL FOR HIGH WINDS ON THE CAMAS PRAIRIE OF

OF AT LEAST A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE TUESDAY NIGHT-WEDNESDAY PERIOD.             
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...THE STRONG SOUTHERLY PRESSURE                  
GRADIENT SHOULD SCOUR OUT MUCH OF THE COLDER AIR TRAPPED IN THE                 
VALLEYS BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A WARM AIRMASS WILL BEGIN PUSHING INTO              
THE AREA FROM THE SOUTH AND TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM UP ON                      
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AND PUSH SNOW LEVELS ABOVE SOME VALLEY FLOORS.              
THURSDAY WILL BE RELATIVELY DRY WITH CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION                  
JUST ALONG THE IDAHO-MONTANA BORDER. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW BEGINS TO               
APPROACH OFF THE WASHINGTON COAST AND WILL PUSH MOISTURE AND                    
ENERGY OVER THE AREA AGAIN ON FRIDAY. THE CONTINUED SOUTHERLY FLOW              
FRIDAY WILL KEEP LOWER VALLEYS AS RAIN THROUGH THE DAY BUT CHANGE
