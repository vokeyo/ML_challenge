<P>This slide shows what happens when a pilot deflects the
<B>ailerons</B>, which are small hinged sections on the outboard
portion of the wing. Ailerons usually work in opposition: as the
right aileron is deflected upward, the left is deflected downward,
and vice versa.</P>

<P>As described on the <A HREF="shape.html">shape effects slide,</A>
changing the angle of deflection at the rear of an airfoil will
change the amount of lift generated by the foil. With greater
downward deflection, the lift will increase in the upward direction.
Notice on this slide that the aileron on the right wing, as viewed
from the front of the aircraft, is deflected down. The aileron on the
left wing is deflected up. Therefore, the lift on the right wing is
increased, while the lift on the left wing is decreased. Because the
forces are not equal, there is a net twist about the center of
gravity in the direction of the larger force. The resulting motion
will roll the aircraft to the left (counterclockwise) as viewed from
the front. If the pilot reverses the aileron deflections (left
aileron down, right aileron up) the aircraft will roll in the
opposite direction.</P>

<P>&#91;You can test this effect yourself using a paper airplane.
Just cut some control tabs into the rear of both wings. Bend one tab
up and the other down, and you will see the airplane roll when it is
flown. The roll will be in the direction of the tab that is pulled
up. The same thing will work on a simple wooden glider. The tabs can
be yellow stick-ums or tape attached to the wings.&#93;</P>

<P>When you travel on an <A HREF="airplane.html">airliner,</A> watch
the wings during turns. The pilot rolls the aircraft in the direction
of the turn. You will probably be surprised at how little deflection
is necessary to bank (roll) a large airliner. But be warned that
there is a possible source of confusion on some airliners. We have
been talking here about rolling the aircraft by using a pair of
ailerons at the very trailing edge of both wings to increase or
decrease the lift of each wing. On some airliners, the aircraft is
rolled by killing the lift on only one wing at a time. A plate,
called a <A HREF="spr.html">spoiler,</A> is raised between the
leading and trailing edges of the wing. This effectively changes the
shape of the airfoil, disrupts the flow over the wing, and causes a
section of the wing to decrease its lift. This produces an unbalanced
force with the other wing, which causes the roll. Airliners use
spoilers because spoilers can react more quickly than ailerons and
require less force to activate, but they always decrease the total
amount of lift for the aircraft. It's an interesting trade! You can
tell whether an airliner is using spoilers or ailerons by noticing
where the moving part is located. At the trailing edge, it's an
aileron; between the leading and trailing edges, it's a spoiler. (Now
you can dazzle the person sitting next to you on the plane!)</P>
