  <td class="text" bgcolor="#FDFFDB" width="700" colspan="2"><span style="font-size:9pt;"><font face="Arial">Following the first increase in the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) charge since July of 2007, natural gas rates will remain the same in March.  Natural gas prices will remain at $1.6753 per therm for year round natural gas customers and $1.6928 per therm for heating only customers. <br><br>Rocky Mount Public Utilities’ encourages natural gas safety for its residents.  Natural gas is colorless, odorless, shapeless, lighter than air and non-toxic.  Natural gas by itself will not burn, but with the proper mixture of gas and air combined with an ignition source, combustion can and will occur.  If released, natural gas will rise and diffuse with air rapidly.  The “gas smell” or rotten egg like smell most people associate with natural gas is an odorant that is added so that it can be detected.  The odor is a warning that natural gas may be present and, if ignited, could result in serious personal injury or property damage.  Residents are advised to call Rocky Mount Public Utilities at 972-1278 day or night to report the smell of natural gas or if you suspect a leak.  <br><br>Customers should continue to conserve and practice energy saving solutions to keep their utility costs down. As a reminder, customers are encouraged to keep thermostats at 68 degrees or lower depending on the individual comfort level. For every degree reduced, customers can expect approximately a three percent reduction in their heating costs. More energy conservation information is available by calling 972-1250 or visiting rockymountnc.gov/utilities.  <br><br>The City of Rocky Mount also has a residential load management program available that enables its customers to receive monthly credits on utility bills.  Customers who participate in any of the load management programs allow Rocky Mount Public Utilities to install a load management switch on their electric water heater, electric heat strips, or central air conditioner, which are the biggest energy users in the home. During periods of heavy demand for power, radio signals sent to the load management switch cycle the controlled units off.  The appliances are cycled off in such a way that the customer possibly won’t even notice.  For more information on the City’s load management program, please call 972-1284.<br></font></span></td>
