  PRESENT:  Amestoy, C.J., Johnson and Skoglund, JJ., and Allen, C.J. (Ret.)
            and Gibson, J.(Ret.), Specially Assigned

        
       ¶  1.  AMESTOY, C. J.   In this workers' compensation action,
  defendant City of Burlington appeals from a judgment based on a jury
  verdict, finding that plaintiff Paul Crosby suffered a compensable
  psychological injury arising out his employment as a firefighter with the
  City.  The City raises two principal claims on appeal: (1) that Chapter II,
  § 70 of the Vermont Constitution precludes workers' compensation benefits
  for psychological injuries unconnected to physical trauma; and (2) that the
  trial court's jury instruction on the standard for determining whether such
  injuries resulted from unusual workplace stress requires reversal because
  it was inconsistent with the standard adopted by the Commissioner of the
  Department of Labor and Industry and the purpose of the workers'
  compensation law.  We agree with the second contention, and therefore
  reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with the views
  expressed herein. 

       ¶  2.  Plaintiff began working for the City as a firefighter in 1975
  and was promoted to the position of lieutenant in 1989.  In the summer of
  1994, he stopped working and sought workers' compensation benefits because
  he was experiencing stress at a level greater than he could handle. 
  Plaintiff identified the stress causing his injury as anxiety resulting
  from the collapse of a building during a May 1994 three-alarm fire and his
  transfer in June 1994 from a shift he had been working since 1989.  He
  alleged that his reaction to the foregoing incidents triggered repressed
  memories of a gruesome 1991 car fire and caused him to lose confidence in
  his superiors and his ability to do his job safely.
   
       ¶  3.  Between the summer of 1994 and the spring of 1995, plaintiff
  saw a number of physicians, including two psychiatrists, and a succession
  of therapists who generally agreed that plaintiff was not fit to return to
  duty.  Several diagnosed his injury as post-traumatic-stress disorder.  The
  City formally terminated plaintiff in March 1995, and later denied his
  claim for workers' compensation benefits.  The matter was brought before
  the Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Industry, who found in
  favor of the City, ruling that plaintiff was not entitled to benefits
  because he had failed to demonstrate that the stressful stimuli causing his
  injury were objectively real and unusual.

       ¶  4.  In so ruling, the Commissioner noted that the diagnoses
  provided by plaintiff's medical experts, in contrast to that of the City's
  expert, were based on plaintiff's own subjective beliefs concerning the
  danger posed by the May 1994  fire, beliefs that were contradicted by other
  witnesses.  In the Commissioner's view, irrespective of whether plaintiff's
  injury was brought on by a sudden stimulus or cumulative stress, plaintiff
  was required to demonstrate an objectively sound basis for his injury.  The
  Commissioner concluded that he had failed to do so.  The Commissioner also
  concluded that the appropriate control group to consider in determining
  whether plaintiff had been subjected to unusual stress was firefighters in
  general rather than all workplace employees.  The Commissioner determined
  that plaintiff was not entitled to workers' compensation benefits because
  the evidence demonstrated that the stress he was experiencing stemmed from
  normal workplace pressures related to fighting fires, being transferred,
  and engaging in conflicts with his superiors.

       ¶  5.  Plaintiff appealed the decision and sought a de novo jury trial
  in the superior court.  See 21 V.S.A. § 670.  Following a two-day trial,
  the court instructed the jury to determine: (1) whether plaintiff had
  suffered a psychological injury; (2) if so, whether the injury was caused
  by factors arising from his employment; and (3) if so, whether the injury
  resulted from stress that was significantly greater than that experienced
  by the general population of employees.  The jury answered each of the
  three questions in the affirmative, and the trial court granted judgment in
  favor of plaintiff.  This appeal followed.  
   
                                     I.

       ¶  6.  The City first contends that the Vermont Constitution bars
  plaintiff's recovery because it prohibits workers' compensation benefits
  for psychological injuries unconnected with physical trauma.  We disagree.
         
       ¶  7.  In relevant part, Chapter II, § 70 of the Vermont Constitution
  provides that the "General Assembly may pass laws compelling compensation
  for injuries received by employees in the course of their employment
  resulting in death or bodily hurt."  The City argues that the plain meaning
  of the phrase "bodily hurt," particularly when considered in its historical
  context, is that the Legislature may authorize workers' compensation
  benefits only for injuries having a physical component.  In support of this
  position, the City notes that at the time § 70 was added to the Vermont
  Constitution in 1913, the Vermont House of Representatives reported that
  workers' compensation would be allowed only for "violence to the physical
  structure of the body," Journal of the House of the State of Vermont,
  Biennial Session, at 1034 (February 20, 1913), and compensation for mental
  injuries unconnected to physical trauma was virtually unknown in Vermont
  negligence law.  See Nichols v. Central Vt. Ry. Co., 94 Vt. 14, 18, 109 A.
  905, 907 (1919) (citing contemporary authority for the doctrine that, in
  absence of statute, no recovery for mental suffering without attendant
  physical injury is available in ordinary actions for negligence).
   
       ¶  8.  We find the constitutional argument unpersuasive.  The phrase
  on which the City relies - "violence to the physical structure of the
  body" - is taken from an amendment to a House bill that failed to pass the
  Senate.  See Journal of the House of the State of Vermont, Biennial
  Session, at 1033-34 (Feb. 20, 1913); Journal of the Senate of the State of
  Vermont, Biennial Session, at 972-73 (Feb. 21, 1913).  Even if we assumed
  that the language in question barred awards for psychological injuries, but
  cf. Bailey v. Am. Gen. Ins. Co., 279 S.W.2d 315, 318-19 (Tex. 1955) (court
  construed phrase "physical structure of the body" to include any harm to
  person), the provisions of a defeated statute can hardly be relied upon to
  support the interpretation of a completely separate constitutional
  amendment.

       ¶  9.  As for the actual text of § 70, "bodily hurt," we agree with
  the City that we must consider the language in historical context, but we
  arrive at a different conclusion from that urged by the City.  Section 70
  was added to the Vermont Constitution in response to concerns that the
  employer liability bills being considered at the time were susceptible to
  constitutional attack. W. Flint, The Progressive Movement in Vermont,
  "Labor Obtains a Workmen's Compensation Act," at  86-87 (Am. Council on
  Public Affairs, Washington, D.C., 1941).  These concerns were fueled by a
  1911 decision of the New York Court of Appeals striking down New York's
  fledgling workers' compensation law.  Id.; see Ives v. South Buffalo Ry.
  Co., 94 N.E. 431 (N.Y. 1911).  It is thus clear that the purpose of § 70
  was to insulate pending workers' compensation laws from constitutional
  attack, not to prevent workers from obtaining benefits based on
  psychological injuries.

       ¶  10.  The City does not argue that the Legislature intended the term
  "personal injury" in 21 V.S.A. § 618 to require physical injury or to
  exclude psychological injury unconnected to physical trauma. Rather, the
  City would have us hold that such claims are prohibited based on a 1913
  constitutional amendment that was added to the Vermont Constitution to
  assure the survival of the workers' compensation statute, not to restrict
  its reach.  Absent any more persuasive evidence, we decline to so hold. 
   
                                     II.

       ¶  11.  The City next contends the trial court erred by instructing
  the jurors that they should consider the "general population of employees"
  in determining whether plaintiff was subjected to unusual work-related
  stress.  To understand the claim, a brief review of the legal background is
  instructive.  Our workers' compensation statute requires employers to
  compensate "a worker [who] receives a personal injury by accident arising
  out of and in the course of employment."  21 V.S.A. § 618(a)(1).  In
  analyzing whether an injury qualifies under workers' compensation law as an
  accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment,
  courts and commentators have divided claims into four general categories:
  (1) physical injury caused by physical stimulus; (2) physical injury caused
  by mental stimulus; (3) nervous injury caused by physical stimulus; and (4)
  nervous injury caused by mental stimulus.  See 3 A. Larson, Larson's
  Workers' Compensation Law § 56.01, at 3 (2000).  This case indisputably
  falls within the latter group, often described as "mental-mental" claims.
   
       ¶  12.  At least twenty-nine states provide workers' compensation
  coverage for mental-mental claims, and fifteen do not.  Id. § 56.06[3]-[4],
  at 52.  Of the states that accept mental-mental claims, some require no
  more of a showing than that required of claims for physical injuries,
  others require a showing that the psychological injury resulted from a
  sudden stimulus, and still others require a showing that the stress was
  unusual when compared with one or another control group.  Id. §
  56.06[2]-[7], at 51-53.  Some state legislatures, in the face of court
  decisions establishing liberal standards for mental-mental claims, have
  amended their workers' compensation laws to limit such claims through a
  variety of means, such as requiring a set amount or type of stress, raising
  the standard of causation, increasing the burden of proof, imposing
  specific diagnostic guidelines, limiting the amount of benefits, or even
  excluding benefits altogether.  Id. § 56.06[1][a]-[b], at 47-51.

       ¶  13.  The only case in which this Court has dealt with a
  mental-mental claim is Bedini v. Frost, 165 Vt. 167, 678 A.2d 893 (1996). 
  There the claimant was a medical receptionist who had worked at her job for
  less than a year before leaving because of job-related stress.  The
  Commissioner denied her claim for workers' compensation benefits, finding
  that she had not been subjected to unusual working conditions, and we
  affirmed that decision.  In so holding, we acknowledged that § 618 does not
  expressly differentiate between physical and mental injuries, but
  nonetheless deferred to the Commissioner's decision to adopt an
  unusual-stress standard for mental-mental claims based on "reasonable
  policy concerns." 165 Vt. at 169, 678 A.2d at 894.  These included the
  Commissioner's finding that medical authorities often disagree on "the
  precise etiology of most mental disorders," that many sources outside of
  the employment setting - including culture, heredity, social environment,
  and family relationships - may cause or contribute to psychological
  injuries, and that medical opinions relating to the cause of such injuries
  are often based on the claimant's subjective viewpoint.  Id.  An
  unusual-stress standard  permits "a more objective inquiry" into the cause
  of the mental injury, id., protects against fraudulent claims, and
  "prevent[s] the conversion of workers' compensation into general health
  insurance."  Id. at 170, 678 A.2d at 894.
   
       ¶  14.  Although the Commissioner in Bedini had expressed the
  unusual-stress standard in terms requiring that the applicant experience "a
  significantly greater dimension [of stress] than the daily stresses
  encountered by all employees," id at 169, 678 A.2d at 894, she did not
  delineate with care the control group of "all employees" whose daily
  stresses were to be compared with the applicant's, nor did we address the
  issue.  As Justice Johnson explained in her dissent, however, unusual
  workplace stress has been measured in at least three different ways.  Id.
  at 173, 678 A.2d at 896 (Johnson, J., dissenting).  One approach requires
  claimants to show that they were subjected to unusual pressures compared to
  other employees in the same workplace with similar responsibilities;
  another approach measures the pressures experienced by a claimant against
  those encountered by all employees doing the same job, sometimes referred
  to as the Wyoming approach; and a third approach requires a showing that a
  claimant experience pressures of a significantly greater dimension than
  those generally encountered by all employees in a working environment,
  often referred to as the Wisconsin approach.  Id.; see. 2 A. Larson, supra,
  § 44.05[4][d], at 52-56 (in determining whether claimant was subjected to
  unusual stress, courts may compare stress encountered by claimant with
  similar employees' normal strains, strains of employment life in general,
  or strains of everyday nonemployment life). (FN2) 
   
       ¶  15.  The second approach - measuring the claimant's stress against
  that of all other workers  performing the same job - is the standard
  advocated by the Commissioner in this case, and,  while the Department's
  decisions have not been a model of consistency, it is the approach the
  Commissioner has generally applied to determine whether an applicant's
  work-related pressures meet the unusual-stress standard.  For example, in
  Cross v. Vermont Dep't of Pub. Safety, Op. No. 27-94WC, at 6 (Aug. 1,
  1994), decided prior to Bedini, the Commissioner rejected the applicant's
  claim for benefits resulting from stress-related mental injuries, noting
  that the applicant had "failed to establish that in relation to other
  similarly situated employees the burdens upon her were greater than they
  were upon them."  In Bedini, as noted, the Commissioner's denial of
  benefits was based in part on a factual finding that other workers in the
  claimant's office were subjected to similar stresses.
   
       ¶  16.  The Commissioner's decisions since Bedini have not always
  clarified whether the control group of similarly situated employees
  includes all workers in similar jobs regardless of employer, or all workers
  employed in similar jobs by the same employer, but none appears to have
  applied a "working world at large" standard.  In Estate of Fatovich v.
  Burlington Free Press, Op. No. 19-97WC, at 8 (July 29, 1997), for example,
  the Commissioner rejected the applicant's claim for injuries from
  work-related stress, observing that the employee's psychological distress
  was not caused by "stressful work events which were greater than the stress
  experienced by similarly situated employees."  Similarly, in Bell v. EHV
  Weidman, Op. No. 03-01WC, at 11 (Feb. 5, 2001), the Commissioner - citing
  Bedini - observed that an applicant claiming mental injury from workplace
  stress must demonstrate "that the stress is of significantly greater
  dimension than the daily stresses encountered by similarly situated
  employees."  Again, in DuBuque v. Grand Union Co., Op. No. 34-02WC, at 11
  (Aug. 20, 2002), the Commissioner found that a claimant seeking benefits
  for mental injury resulting from work-related stress had failed to prove
  that "the stress is of significantly greater dimension than the daily
  stresses encountered by similarly situated employees."  And in a case
  involving a firefighter claiming mental injury from a stressful work
  environment, the Commissioner specifically found that the claimant had not
  demonstrated work-related stresses "that were of a significantly greater
  dimension than the daily stresses encountered by other firefighters." 
  Gallipo v. City of Rutland, Op. No. 22-00WC, at 7 (July 12, 2000).

       ¶  17.  Thus, in this - as in most recent decisions - the Commissioner
  has applied the unusual-stress standard to require a comparison of
  claimant's stress to that of other similarly situated employees  performing
  the same or similar work.  The Commissioner's approach is hardly unique. 
  Although new to this Court, the question of the proper control group to be
  used for purposes of assessing whether an applicant's work-related stress
  is unusual has been extensively explored by other courts and commentators. 
  Justice Johnson cogently summarized the three basic approaches in her
  Bedini dissent; one requires a showing that the claimant suffered greater
  than normal stress as compared to all workers in general; a second compares
  the claimant's stress to other workers in the same workplace with similar
  responsibilities; and a third measures the claimant's stress as against
  other similarly situated employees, regardless of employer.  Bedini, 165
  Vt. at 173, 678 A.2d at 896-97 (Johnson, J., dissenting); see generally 2
  A. Larson, supra, § 44.05[4][d], at 52-53; Graves v. Utah Power &amp; Light
  Co., 713 P.2d 187, 192 (Wyo. 1986) (discussing basic approaches for
  applying  unusual-stress standard). (FN3) 
                                                                
       ¶  18.     Although a few courts have adopted the so-called Wisconsin
  standard that compares a claimant's stress to the daily strains which all
  employees must experience, see, e.g., Townsend v. Me. Bureau of Pub.
  Safety, 404 A.2d 1014, 1019 (Me. 1979); School Dist. # 1, Vill. of Brown
  Deer v. Dep't of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations, 215 N.W.2d 373, 377-78
  (Wis. 1974), others have  specifically rejected it in favor of the Wyoming
  standard that looks to the "day-to-day mental stresses experienced by other
  workers employed in the same or similar jobs."  Graves, 713 P.2d at 193;
  accord Dunlavey v. Econ. Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 526 N.W.2d 845, 858 (Iowa 1995)
  (employee must establish that mental injury was caused by workplace stress
  of greater magnitude "than the day-to-day mental stresses experienced by
  other workers employed in the same or similar jobs"); Williams v. DePaul
  Health Ctr., 996 S.W.2d 619, 628 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999) ("[w]e are persuaded
  that the proper comparison . . . is to compare Employee's work-related
  stress with the stress encountered by employees having similar positions,
  regardless of employer"); see also McClain v. Texaco, Inc., 780 S.W.2d 34,
  37 (Ark. Ct. App. 1989) (holding that "ultimate test is whether the stress
  constitutes an abnormal working condition for that type of employment,"
  rather than claimant's co-workers); Southwire Co. v. George, 470 S.E.2d
  865, 870-71 (Ga. 1996) (Sears, J., specially concurring) (plurality in
  dictum urges adoption of Wyoming over Wisconsin standard for reasons set
  forth in Dunlavey, 526 N.W.2d at 857-58); Davis v. Workmen's Comp. Appeal
  Bd., 751 A.2d 168, 177 (Pa. 2000) (for work conditions to be considered
  abnormal, " 'they must be considered in the context of the specific
  employment' ") (quoting Wilson v. Workmen's Comp. Appeal Bd., 669 A.2d 338,
  343 (Pa. 1996)).
   
       ¶  19.   Sound policy reasons support such an approach.  As noted,
  Bedini itself was based on a recognition that purely psychological injuries
  may result from so many  "diverse factors" that "a high degree of
  uncertainty exists in the diagnosis of cause." 165 Vt. at 169, 678 A.2d at
  894.  It is precisely this uncertainty of origin that has persuaded many
  courts and commentators to conclude that the optimum control group for
  determining unusual stress is that of other similarly situated employees in
  the same or similar jobs.  In contrast to the broad "all employees"
  standard, which the court in Graves aptly noted is "too amorphous to be
  practical,"  713 P.2d at 193, or the narrow class of workers with the same
  employer, which may be too limiting where the business has few employees,
  see Dunlavey, 526 N.W.2d at 857, a control group comprised of similarly
  situated workers in the same general field provides a relatively precise,
  fair, and empirically workable standard.   

       ¶  20.  A control group comprised of the "working world" would offer
  little in the way of assuring the validity of claims.  It is difficult to
  imagine that a claimant or employer under an "all employees" rubric would
  not be able to produce some witness from the workplace whose "work-related
  stress is either significantly less or significantly greater than the
  stress experienced by the claimant."  N. Riley, Mental-Mental Claims:
  Placing Limitations on Recovery Under Workers' Compensation for Day-to-Day
  Frustration, 65 Mo. L. Rev. 1023, 1043 (2000).   Such a moveable standard
  could defeat the very purpose of the unusual-stress requirement, which is
  to ensure compensation for deserving claimants while simultaneously
  protecting against "fraudulent claims and prevent[ing] the conversion of
  workers' compensation into general health insurance." Bedini, 165 Vt. at
  170, 678 A.2d at 894.  As the court in Dunlavey explained: "By comparing
  the stresses endured by similarly situated employees, the Wyoming standard
  provides the employees with compensation for legitimate work related
  injuries while at the same time limits the employers' liability to injuries
  caused by its industry."  526 N.W.2d at 857.
   
       ¶  21.  The similarly-situated standard also offers the practical
  advantage of allowing both parties to focus on producing evidence of actual
  employment conditions in a specific field, "rather than trying to take into
  account the level of stress placed on the workplace as a whole."  Riley,
  supra, 65 Mo. L. Rev. at 1043.  This has the added benefit of promoting
  consistency among similar cases; an all-employees test, in contrast, could
  result in dissimilar outcomes depending upon the stress levels in the
  at-large employment context on which the parties choose to focus.  See G.
  Dawes, Eligibility for Workers' Compensation in Cases of Nontraumatic
  Mental Injury: The Development of the Unusual Stress Test in Wisconsin,
  1987 Wis. L. Rev. 363, 372 (1987) (different results could occur where
  "each court focuses on the stresses present in a different context of daily
  life").         
   
       ¶  22.  These various advantages have led commentators to conclude
  that the similarly-situated standard provides a "realistic and balanced
  test of legal causation," M. Duckworth &amp; T.Eick, Recent Developments in
  Mental/Mental Cases Under the Iowa Workers' Compensation Law, 45 Drake L.
  Rev. 809, 837 (1997), that is "superior to the other comparison standards."
  Riley, supra, 65 Mo. L. Rev. at 1043.  The result, to be sure, may be that
  some employees in high-stress jobs will fail to establish claims where
  other workers, confronted with similar strains, might succeed.   By its
  nature, however, the unusual-stress test "is necessarily underinclusive." 
  Dawes, supra, 1987 Wis. L. Rev. at 373.  Bedini established that not every
  employee who suffers mental injury from workplace stress will recover; to
  establish the requisite causal nexus between psychological injury and
  workplace stress a claimant must meet a heightened standard of proof
  premised upon a showing of unusual stress. 165 Vt. at 169-70, 678 A.2d at
  894.   By focusing on the conditions and pressures endemic in the
  claimant's specific field of employment, the Commissioner does not
  undermine the purpose of the workers' compensation law - as plaintiff
  asserts - but rather serves that purpose by ensuring that only genuine
  claims for workplace stress are compensated.   

       ¶  23.  Although the similarly-situated standard thus enjoys the
  support of the Commissioner, commentators in the field, and other states,
  plaintiff asserts that it is predicated on the discredited doctrine of
  "assumption of the risk."  Plaintiff is mistaken.  It is fair to measure a
  claimant's stress by the conditions normal to his or her field or
  profession not because the claimant implicitly "assumes" the risks of
  employment, but rather because it is reasonable to assume that the claimant
  is prepared to deal with the normal strains of his or her occupation
  through training, temperament, and experience.  Thus, the standard does not
  prejudice workers in high-stress fields, or benefit workers in low-stress
  occupations, but "allows for a uniform application of a legal standard
  across the wide spectrum of all jobs."  Duckworth &amp; Eick, supra, 45 Drake
  L. Rev. at 837.   

       ¶  24.  While other approaches are certainly possible, the
  Commissioner's reliance on a control group comprised of "similarly
  situated" employees is well supported by established authority and sound
  policy. Therefore, under our traditionally deferential standard of review
  the Commissioner's approach is entitled to control.  See In re Duncan, 155
  Vt. 402, 408, 584 A.2d 1140, 1144  (1990) (absent compelling indication of
  error, interpretation of statute by administrative body responsible for its
  execution will be sustained on appeal).  We hold, therefore, that the trial
  court erred in instructing the jury to determine whether plaintiff's stress
  was unusual as compared with the general population of employees, rather
  than with all other employees performing similar work.  Accordingly, the
  judgment must be reversed.
   
       ¶  25.  The parties raise several additional claims that require
  little discussion.  The City urges an unusual-stress rule that would bar
  any claim for injuries sustained in the performance of duties within the
  claimant's job description.  The City cites no persuasive authority for
  such a  rule, which we reject as inflexible and unnecessary to serve the
  purposes of the unusual-stress standard.  The City also contends the
  "working world" standard contained in the trial court instruction violates
  the Common Benefits Clause, Vt. Const., ch.I, art. 7, by treating
  dissimilar employees the same.  Our holding renders this argument moot. 
  Finally, plaintiff asserts on cross-appeal that regardless of the
  applicable control group, there was no need to give an unusual-stress
  instruction because his injuries were the result of a "sudden stimulus." 
  See 3 Larson, supra, § 56.04[2-7] (discussing distinction some courts have
  drawn between injuries caused by sudden stimulus and those caused by
  cumulative stress).  We need not address the question, however, as the
  record shows that plaintiff's psychological injury claim had several
  sources,  including personnel problems unrelated to the 1991 and 1994
  fires, and we therefore find no error in the instruction.    

       The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further
  proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
   

                                       FOR THE COURT:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Dissenting

        
       ¶  26.  JOHNSON, J, dissenting.   The majority opinion not only lacks
  support in the workers' compensation statute, but it interprets that
  statute in a way that disadvantages workers who perform society's most
  dangerous and often most critical jobs.  The claimant in this case was
  employed as a firefighter.  After nineteen years on the job, he terminated
  his employment and filed a compensation claim because he was experiencing
  an intolerable level of stress and anxiety related to his work.  The
  Commissioner of Labor and Industry acknowledged that claimant's injury was
  caused by workplace pressures, but nonetheless denied the claim on the
  ground that the pressures were typical of those encountered by all
  firefighters.  In other words, claimant should have been able to tolerate
  any stress suffered from the day-to-day work of fighting fires.  Following
  a de novo trial in the superior court, the jury concluded in special
  interrogatories that claimant's stress was work-related and that claimant
  was entitled to workers' compensation benefits because his psychological
  injury resulted from stress significantly greater than that typically
  encountered in the general workplace.  On appeal to this Court, the
  majority acknowledges, as it is bound to do, that claimant's injury is
  work-related.  Nevertheless, the majority refuses to uphold the jury's
  award because the trial court did not instruct the jury that, to prove
  causation, a firefighter must demonstrate that the claimed injury resulted
  from extraordinarily stressful events compared to those typically
  encountered by other firefighters.  In so holding, the majority decision
  sets forth an entirely new policy direction that is inconsistent with our
  statute mandating that workers be compensated for work-related injuries. 
  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
   
       ¶  27.  The governing statute, 21 V.S.A. 618(a)(1), provides for
  compensation to any worker who "receives a personal injury by accident
  arising out of and in the course of employment."  The majority acknowledges
  that the term "personal injury" includes a mental disorder or disability
  arising from workplace experiences, whether or not caused by physical
  trauma.  The statute requires only that the injury be work-related; it does
  not require any additional proof of causation for mental stress claims. 
  The test that the majority adopts to reverse the jury verdict is employed
  by the Commissioner to ferret out fraudulent claims and to assure that
  workers claiming mental injuries have been injured as the result of stress
  caused by work - a fact that is not in doubt in this case.  Thus, the test,
  which is merely a tool to aid the Commissioner in determining a difficult
  factual question, is being used to deny the claim in a case where we know
  the injury is work-related.   The tail is wagging the dog.

       ¶  28.  Nor do I find persuasive the majority's position that it is
  fair to adopt a higher standard of causation, one that makes it  more
  difficult for emergency personnel to establish stress-related claims, 
  because persons in stressful occupations  should be able to cope with the
  greater strains of their occupation through training, temperament, and
  experience.  Like all of us, those working as police officers, firefighters
  and other emergency personnel are human beings susceptible to stress, and,
  invariably, some of them will suffer work-related injuries because of that
  stress.  When they do, our law entitles them to compensation.  It may well
  be that emergency personnel will submit more stress-related claims than
  office workers.  So be it.  It is beyond our role, or that of the
  Commissioner, to rewrite the law in an attempt to limit the number of
  claims filed or to prevent the  workers' compensation system from becoming
  a "general health insurance program," as the majority fears.  
   
       ¶  29.  Notwithstanding the majority's contentions to the contrary,
  today's decision is not compelled by our prior case law or by any
  deferential standard of review that we have applied to the Commissioner's
  decisions in the past.  Until today, the only time that this Court has
  addressed a mental stress claim is in Bedini v. Frost, 165 Vt. 167, 678
  A.2d 893 (1996), where we upheld the Commissioner's denial of a medical
  receptionist's stress-related claim.  The sole issue on appeal in that case
  was whether we should defer to the Commissioner's standard requiring those
  making so-called mental-mental claims to " 'show that the stresses at work
  were of a significantly greater dimension than the daily stresses
  encountered by all employees.' "  Bedini, 165 Vt. at 169, 678 A.2d at 894
  (quoting Commissioner).  We deferred to the Commissioner's heightened
  standard for mental-mental claims - even though the statute does not
  distinguish between mental and physical injuries - because there was a
  reasonable basis for concluding that the standard furthered the purpose of
  Vermont law to compensate workers only for work-related personal injuries. 
  We acknowledged "that the precise etiology of most mental disorders is
  inexplicable," and that because of the diverse factors that may cause
  mental illness, diagnosing cause is a highly uncertain task.  Id.  We
  emphasized that requiring mental-mental claimants to show that they were
  subjected to unusually stressful working conditions would create more
  objectivity in determining causation, particularly "because the claimant's
  subjective impression that work-related stress caused [the] injury often
  forms the basis for the medical opinion that the injury was caused
  primarily by work-related stress."  Id. at 169-70, 678 A.2d at 894.

       ¶  30.  In short, in Bedini, we concluded that the policy objectives
  underlying our workers' compensation law - to restrict benefits to
  work-related injuries - supported the Commissioner's decision to require
  mental-mental claimants to show that they had been subjected to unusually
  stressful working conditions "of a significantly greater dimension than the
  daily stresses encountered by all employees."  Id.  In this case, the
  superior court instructed the jury using precisely the same language that
  we accepted in Bedini.  Nevertheless, the majority now concludes that we
  never addressed what the control group should be under the unusual-stress
  standard, and that, to the extent that the Commissioner and this Court in
  Bedini articulated an "all employees" control group, a different control
  group - "all similarly situated employees" - was really intended.  In
  support of these contentions, the majority cites other decisions by the
  Commissioner invoking the "similarly situated employees" standard, as well
  as my dissent in Bedini.

       ¶  31.  Neither the Commissioner's prior or subsequent decisions nor
  my dissent in Bedini support the majority's position.  To apply the
  unusual-stress standard, there must be some control group - the standard
  cannot exist in a vacuum.  In determining whether unusual stressors existed
  at work, the question must be answered - unusual in what context?  As I
  repeatedly emphasized in my dissent in Bedini, the Commissioner in that
  case had "articulated," "adopted," and "chosen" the broad Wisconsin "all
  employees" standard, but had actually considered criteria inconsistent with
  that standard.  See id. at 172-74, 678 A.2d at 896-97 (Johnson, J.,
  dissenting).  The main thrust of the dissent, however, was my concern that
  the Commissioner had exceeded her statutory authority by employing any kind
  of heightened standard for mental-mental claims, given that our workers'
  compensation law did not distinguish between physical and mental injuries. 
  See id. at 175, 678 A.2d at 897 (Johnson, J., dissenting).  In any event,
  my dissent in Bedini certainly made the Court aware of the various control
  groups - including the "similarly situated employees" control group adopted
  today - that had been followed by other jurisdictions.  See id. at 173, 678
  A.2d at 896 (Johnson, J., dissenting) (delineating different approaches).
  (FN4)  Nevertheless, the majority in Bedini simply adopted the "all
  employees" standard articulated by the Commissioner in that case.
       
       ¶  32.  Further, although the Commissioner in Bedini considered
  criteria inconsistent with the "all employees" control group she
  articulated, there is little doubt that she intended to apply that control
  group.  The Commissioner cited three prior decisions in support of its
  application of the "all employees" control group.  The earliest was a 1985
  case in which the Commissioner first determined that mental-mental injuries
  were covered under Vermont's workers' compensation act.  See Hannon v.
  Woodstock Inn, Op. No. 19-85WC, at 7 (Apr. 22, 1986).  In that case, the
  Commissioner concluded that there was no logical basis for distinguishing
  between physical and emotional disability, and that the governing statute
  did not make any such distinction.  Id.  The Commissioner determined that
  the standard for accepting mental-mental claims should not be any more
  restrictive than for claims based on physical injuries, but that awards for
  mental-mental injuries could not be based solely on the claimant's
  subjective perceptions.  Id. at 7-8.  In the second decision, however, the
  Commissioner required those seeking compensation for non-traumatic
  mental-mental work-related injuries to show that the injury resulted "from
  an employment situation of clearly greater dimension than the day-to-day
  emotional strain and tension experienced by an ordinary employee or there
  must be no other possible causes for the claimant's mental injury, except
  for the tensions of the workplace."  Wilson v. Quechee Lakes Landowners
  Ass'n, Op. No. 9-87WC, at 6 (Nov. 4, 1987) (emphasis added).  In the third
  decision, the Commissioner applied the same "all employees" standard
  articulated in Wilson.  See Mazut v. Gen. Elec. Co., Op. No. 3-89WC, at 8
  (Oct. 26, 1990).

       ¶  33.  For the most part, the majority cites more recent decisions by
  the Commissioner to support its conclusion that, in Bedini, the
  Commissioner was not really adopting the standard that she stated she was
  adopting.  It may be that the Commissioner's decisions have evolved to
  apply a "similarly situated employee" control group, but that does not
  change the fact that (1) the Commissioner in Bedini articulated the "all
  employees" control group; (2) this Court adopted that standard; and (3) the
  trial court in this case properly instructed the jury on that standard.
   
       ¶  34.  Nevertheless, because the majority prefers the Commissioner's
  current policy approach, it now concludes that this Court must defer to the
  Commissioner's ever-evolving and more exclusive control group.  I strongly
  disagree.  We owe the Commissioner no deference in such circumstances.  See
  Martin v. Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 2003 VT 14,   8, 15, 819 A.2d 742
  (administrative bodies have only adjudicatory authority conferred upon them
  by statute; administratively adopted regulations that compromise intent of
  authorizing statute will not be upheld).

       ¶  35.  I reiterate that, in Bedini, we deferred to the Commissioner's
  judgment only because we found that the heightened standard for
  mental-mental claims adopted in that case furthered the statute's goal of
  providing relief for only work-related injuries.  Id. at 169-70, 678 A.2d
  at 894.  The rationale underlying the unusual-stress standard is that
  requiring employees to show that their mental-mental injuries resulted from
  pressures of a significantly greater dimension than those generally
  encountered in the workplace will help to assure that workers' compensation
  benefits are limited to legitimate work-related claims.  See Sch. Dist. #
  1, Vill. of Brown Deer v. Dep't of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations, 215
  N.W.2d 373, 377-78 (Wis. 1974).
   
       ¶  36.  The same cannot be said, however, of the standard adopted by
  the majority today.  I fail to see how requiring employees to demonstrate
  that the pressures they experienced exceeded the level typically
  encountered by other similarly situated employees helps to assure that
  work-related injuries, and only work-related injuries, are compensated.  In
  my view, such a standard is both overinclusive - in that it tends to allow
  more claims involving mental-mental injuries of questionable origin in
  low-stress occupations - and underinclusive - in that it tends to exclude
  legitimate claims of work-related mental-mental injuries in high-stress
  jobs.  See Bedini, 165 Vt. at 173, 678 A.2d at 896 (Johnson, J.,
  dissenting) (applying standard that compares similarly situated employees
  would be unfair because workers in low-stress jobs could meet standard
  easily, while persons in particularly stressful occupations would rarely be
  able to show unusual stress).

       ¶  37.  The instant case underscores that the control group adopted by
  the majority is underinclusive.  The City does not challenge the
  sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's conclusions that
  plaintiff suffered a psychological injury, that the injury was caused by
  work-related stress, and that the stress causing the injury greatly
  exceeded that typically encountered by the general population of workers. 
  Hence, it is difficult to see why claimant's injury should not be
  compensable under § 618(a)(1), which "guarantees workers a remedy for a
  work place injury."  Gerrish v. Savard, 169 Vt. 468, 470, 739 A.2d 1195,
  1197 (1999).  A standard that would award compensation to a clerical worker
  who suffered a nervous breakdown after escaping from a burning building,
  but would deny benefits to a firefighter who suffered a nervous breakdown
  from fighting the very same fire - simply because firefighters typically
  experience such stressful stimuli, while clerks do not - violates the
  underlying purpose of our workers' compensation law to provide relief to
  all employees who have suffered work-related accidental injuries.
   
       ¶  38.  Examining cases in other jurisdictions that have adopted the
  "similarly situated employees" control group vividly demonstrates how
  difficult it can be for workers in high-stress jobs to obtain workers'
  compensation benefits for mental-mental claims, even when those claims are
  plainly based on work-related injuries.  For example, in City of Phila. v.
  Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd., 728 A.2d 938, 940 (Pa. 1999), a divided 
  Pennsylvania Supreme Court applied such a control group in upholding a
  determination that a police officer who was indicted on manslaughter
  charges and subjected to intense media publicity before eventually being
  acquitted of shooting and killing an unarmed individual had not experienced
  abnormal working conditions so as to entitle him to workers' compensation
  benefits for his psychological injury.  In Vermont, what level of tragedy
  will have to occur before firefighters or other emergency personnel will be
  able to obtain compensation for disabling workplace stress?

       ¶  39.  Undoubtedly, workers in high-stress occupations are going to
  suffer more work-related psychological injuries than workers in low-stress
  occupations, just as workers in certain types of jobs will be more likely
  to suffer back injuries than workers in other jobs.  But there is no
  indication that the Legislature intended to preclude compensation for
  mental-stress injuries suffered by firefighters, police officers, and other
  workers in high-stress occupations because of greater expectations as to
  their ability to withstand stress.  The principle of assumption of risk has
  no place in our no-fault workers' compensation law.  See Gerrish, 169 Vt.
  at 470, 739 A.2d at 1197 (Vermont's workers' compensation law represents
  public policy compromise in which employee gives up right to sue employer
  in tort, and employer assumes strict liability for work-related injuries). 
  The fact that emergency personnel are carefully screened before being hired
  and are trained to deal with the heightened daily stress they encounter on
  the job does not preclude them from receiving workers' compensation
  benefits when they suffer a mental injury notwithstanding the screening and
  training.  Undoubtedly firefighters are trained in many areas, including 
  how to avoid being burned.  Yet, when they are burned on the job despite
  the training, they receive compensation.  The same should be true when the
  injuries are psychological rather than physical.
   
       ¶  40.  The City expresses concerns that allowing mental-mental
  claims without requiring workers in stressful occupations to show that they
  experienced pressures beyond that normally encountered by other similarly
  situated workers has the potential to create an early pension system for
  such workers, at the expense of the workers' compensation system.  But
  those are the types of complex policy considerations that the Legislature
  is better suited to consider.  See Hillerby v. Town of Colchester, 167 Vt.
  270, 276, 706 A.2d 446, 449 (1997).  As it stands now, the unusual-stress
  standard is being applied administratively in Vermont in a manner that
  thwarts the stated policy of our workers' compensation law to compensate
  workers for work-related injuries, irrespective of whether those injuries
  have a physical or psychological origin.  Absent a statutory amendment, the
  Commissioner may not implement the workers' compensation statute by
  limiting mental-mental claims in an effort to reduce the cost of insurance,
  rather than to ensure that benefits are being conferred for only
  work-related claims.
   
       ¶  41.  Some jurisdictions with statutes similar to ours do not
  require any additional showing of causation for workers claiming
  mental-mental injuries.  See 2 A. Larson, Larson's Workers' Compensation
  Law § 44.05[4][d][iii], at 56-57 (2000).  Other jurisdictions have imposed
  the unusual-stress standard using an "all employees" control group,
  notwithstanding the potential difficulty in determining whether the claimed
  injury was caused by unusual pressures when compared with those experienced
  by all employees.  See, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A, § 201(3)(A)
  (work-related mental injury is not compensable unless it is shown by clear
  and convincing evidence that stress was "extraordinary and unusual in
  comparison to pressures and tensions experienced by the average employee"). 
  In Bedini, we deferred to the Commissioner's decision to adopt the latter
  approach despite the absence of explicit statutory authority, but I would
  decline to allow further administratively imposed restrictions that are
  inconsistent with the fundamental underlying purpose of our statute to
  compensate workers for work-related injuries.  See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine
  Ins. Co. v. Surdam, 156 Vt. 585, 590, 595 A.2d 264, 266 (1991) ("[O]ur
  workers' compensation statute is remedial and must be liberally construed
  to provide injured employees with benefits unless the law is clear to the
  contrary.").

       ¶  42.  Ultimately, our Legislature may choose to enact a detailed
  workers' compensation law that imposes explicit and detailed limitations
  pertaining to mental-mental claims, as some other jurisdictions have done. 
  Until then, I would hold the line at Bedini and allow the Legislature to
  weigh the complex policy considerations involved in determining whether,
  and if so how, to limit mental-mental workers' compensation claims.

FN1.  This appeal was originally argued in March 2002, and then resubmitted
  on briefs in August 2003 following the retirement of Justice Morse and the
  recusal of Justice Dooley from the case.

FN2.  Although plaintiff here claims that Bedini adopted the
  "all-employees-in-the-workforce" standard, our opinion was concerned solely
  with whether the workers' compensation statute supported the Commissioner's
  decision to "differentiate between physical and mental injuries" by
  adopting an unusual-stress standard.  165 Vt. at 170, 678 A.2d at 894.  To
  assert that Bedini resolved the complex control-group issue without comment
  or discussion strains credulity.  If anything, however, the Commissioner's
  broad reference in Bedini to "all employees" masked a decision to utilize a
  much narrower control group composed of similarly situated employees of the
  same employer.  See Graves v. Utah Power &amp; Light Co., 713 P.2d 187, 192
  (Wyo. 1986) (the "'all employees' standard could be based upon three
  different groups," a worker's "fellow employees" doing the same or similar
  job, workers generally in the same job, or the "working world at large"). 
  As Justice Johnson observed in her dissent, while the Commissioner had
  "articulated" a standard based on "all employees," the approach that came
  "closest to what the Commissioner ha[d] actually done" utilized a control
  group of "other employees in the same workplace with similar
  responsibilities."  Bedini, 165 Vt. at 173, 678 A.2d at 896 (Johnson, J.,
  dissenting).  Thus, by adopting the Commissioner's approach, it is at least
  arguable that Bedini endorsed the most narrow control group of the three.
  This is the conclusion, in fact, of the preeminent workers' compensation
  authority, who has categorized Bedini as a case requiring the claimant to
  "show that his or her stresses at work were significantly greater than the
  stress levels affecting co-employees."  3 A. Larson, Larson's Workers'
  Compensation Law § 56.06D[6], at 143 (2000).  It is clear to us, however,
  that Bedini did not actually address or decide the control-group issue. 

FN3.  Still another approach is to compare the claimant's stress with the
  strains of everyday non-employment life in general.  See 2A Larson, supra,
  § 44.05[4][d] at 53.

FN4.  In discussing the various control groups adopted in other
  jurisdictions, I noted some of the problems inherent to each group,
  including the "all employees" group.  See Bedini, 165 Vt. at 173, 678 A.2d
  at 896-97 (Johnson, J., dissenting).  Nevertheless, my view was, and still
  is, that the Legislature, not the Commissioner or this Court, should weigh
  the complex policy considerations involved in determining whether and, if
  so, how to limit mental stress claims.

STIPULATIONS:

1. At all relevant times, the claimant was an employee of the City of
Burlington within the  meaning of the Workers' Compensation Act.

2. At all relevant times, the defendant was an employer within the meaning of
the Workers'  Compensation Act.

3. Claimant has not actually worked at the Burlington Fire Department since
June 20, 1994,  and he retired pursuant to the City's disability retirement
policy in April 1995.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1. In 1975, claimant began working for the Burlington Fire Department ("Fire
Department")  as an assistant clerk firefighter.  After about a year and a
half, he transferred to a fulltime  position as dispatcher, a job he held for
more than a year.  As a dispatcher, claimant  assisted in fielding emergency
calls, making the necessary calls in response, and  dispatching the
appropriate personnel.  When off duty, he sometimes assisted at fires, but 
not to the extent of the on duty firefighters.

2. Next, claimant served as an ambulance attendant/firefighter with the Fire
Department at  Winooski Avenue where he responded to emergency calls and
sometimes fought fires.   While working in that capacity, he encountered
situations ranging from the mundane to  the life threatening, including car
accidents, cardiac arrests, broken legs, suicides, cut  fingers, and strokes. 
None of these incidents caused claimant to have a traumatic  reaction.

3. Around 1980, claimant began working on the fire trucks as a firefighter. 
He then had to  learn certain techniques and how to operate certain
equipment.  He typically worked 56  hours per week, with 24-hour shifts
followed by 48 hours off.

4. For his work as a firefighter, claimant received formal training through
fire schools and  training sessions provided to firefighters.  He learned how
to use the equipment, how to  enter buildings, what he would encounter as a
firefighter, how to respond to physical and  psychological stress, and other
skills essential to fire fighting.  In addition, he gained  valuable
on-the-job training and experience.


5. On December 25, 1989, claimant was promoted to the position of Lieutenant,
a job  requiring new duties and responsibilities.  As Lieutenant, he was
assigned to the tower  truck and was responsible for the people on duty with
him.  It was his responsibility to  organize the daily schedule of his shift,
make decisions at the station, and work with the  general public as well as
the Fire Department.  At a fire, he assumed command of the  scene before a
senior officer arrived, directed the work of all firefighters in the absence
of  a station commander, assigned firefighters to lay out and connect hose
lines and nozzles,  oversaw the firefighters and made sure they were safe.

6. Claimant testified that a firefighter has to be able to deal with
stresses, put them aside,  and not take them personally in order to do the
job.  Work in the fire service is difficult,  dangerous, and stressful with
the duties and responsibilities of a Lieutenant being more  stressful than
those of an ordinary firefighter.

7. Before May of 1994, claimant's career at the Fire Department was
successful.  Between  1984 and 1993, his supervisors consistently evaluated
his performance as "excellent,"  with only one "satisfactory" rating and no
"unsatisfactory" ratings.  Prior to the events of  mid-1994, claimant never
had any noteworthy problems with his supervisors.

8. Claimant did not have difficulty adjusting to the demands of his job. 
Although he  sometimes encountered situations in which his own safety, or
that of another, was in  danger, he was generally able to deal with the
experience without undue difficulty.

9. Debbie Crosby, claimant's wife, testified that her husband was generally
satisfied with his  work until May 1994.  She expected that he would work for
the Fire Department for the  rest of his life.  Ms. Crosby testified further
that he generally handled traumatic incidents  without much difficulty.  With
the exception of the so-called "car incident," described  below, she
testified that claimant generally did not go home "shaken up," even after a 
difficult event.

The Duties of a Firefighter

10. The nature of the job of a firefighter is by definition outside the range
of usual human  experience.  Firefighters are advised to expect physical and
emotional stressors.  For  example, at a moment's notice they must respond to
whatever a call requires, such as  carrying hoses, making connections,
entering a building, and removing sections of a  burning structure in order
to get to the fire.  Training includes what they can expect to  experience
emotionally.  Debriefing is offered to firefighters after particularly
stressful  fires, but no specific policy was in place at the Burlington Fire
Department specifying  when debriefing was required.

11. Dayton Contois has worked as Fire Safety (Training) Officer, Interim
Chief of the  Department and, effective June 1994, Chief of the Fire
Department.  He testified that  firefighters must be able to overcome the
instinctive fight or flight response.  He also  testified that they place
their need to protect themselves below accomplishment of the  mission at
hand, accept that they may not always be successful and that, despite their 
efforts, buildings still burn and people sometimes die.

12. Claimant described in a credible way a typical day for a firefighter in
the Burlington Fire  Department.  The firefighters relieve the prior shift,
learn what happened the day before,  plan their activities, prepare meals,
work around the station, take training courses,  conduct inspections, do
public education and outreach, and respond to calls.  On average,  claimant
fielded three or four calls per day.

13. About half of the calls typically involve medical assistance to the
ambulance crew.  Other  calls involve accidental alarms, frozen sprinkler
systems, hazardous spills, and actual  fires.  Only about 10% of the calls a
firefighter receives actually involve a fire.

14. Chief Dayton Contois, who has been a member of the Fire Department for
more than 30  years, testified that fire fighting is a unique occupation in
which firefighters are subjected  to human tragedy, injury and death, and are
themselves subject to injury and death  through the course of their careers. 
However, Chief Contois acknowledged that incidents  such as suicides, fatal
motor vehicle accidents, fires in which people perish, and similar  traumatic
incidents are not that common.  He explained that firefighters in his
department  do not encounter traumatic incidents on a daily basis, "but
obviously the situation is there  for us to do so if the situation should
warrant."

15. Claimant and Chief Contois explained the difference between single alarm,
two-alarm,  three-alarm, and four-alarm fires.  A one-alarm fire calls for
the fire fighting power of a  single district, usually three trucks.  The
fire is small enough for the firefighters initially  dispatched to handle it. 
A two-alarm fire calls into action the rest of the people on duty  citywide,
usually 18 to 20 firefighters.  A three-alarm fire is one of sufficient
magnitude  to require additional staff, with the need to call in the off-duty
firefighters and all  available trucks.  Typically, a three-alarm fire calls
in at least twice as many firefighters  as a two-alarm fire.  Finally, a
four-alarm fire is one that is so large and so difficult to  control that aid
is requested from neighboring fire departments, a mutual service.

16. Claimant testified that three and four-alarm fires are relatively rare,
occurring perhaps  three or four times per year.  Chief Contois agreed that
three-alarm fires are unusual.

17. Claimant worked as a firefighter for 15 of the nearly 20 years he spent
on the force.   During that time he encountered about a dozen fires in which
fatalities occurred.  In none  of those cases did he know any of the victims. 
In the 30 years Chief Contois has been  affiliated with the Department, he
has been involved with about 25 fires involving  fatalities.

18. During his career, claimant never fought a fire that claimed the life of
a colleague, except  for one after which a colleague suffered a cardiac
arrest.

19. Claimant explained that real-life fire fighting is not the same as it is
depicted on  television and in the movies.  In real life, firefighters use
many more safety precautions,  dramatic fires are rare and horrific scenes
and brushes with death are uncommon. The Car Fire

20. In February 1991, the claimant responded to what he thought was a routine
car fire on  College Street in Burlington.  After he and the other
firefighters extinguished the fire, he  noticed, to his horror, a severely
burned body whose clothing, ears and fingertips had  been burned off.  When
claimant got closer, he saw that the person was still breathing.  The
firefighters then removed the victim from a still smoldering car and had him
rushed  to a hospital where later he died.  The event continued to haunt the
claimant.

21. Claimant testified that, in accordance with Fire Department procedures,
he called in the  battalion chief.  The chief responded by reprimanding
claimant for calling him,  suggesting that the Fire Marshall was the
appropriate person.  The Chief then dismissed  the matter without arranging
for any follow-up care or debriefing for claimant.

22. Although he experienced the car fire as traumatic and was angered by his
superior's  response, claimant was not disabled as a result.

23. After the car fire, claimant became more and more distressed by what he
perceived to be  lax safety procedures in the fire Department, although he
conceded that the Department  had a good safety record.  Although the precise
date is not clear, sometime in 1991  claimant decided he would work no more
extra duty for the Fire Department.

24. Claimant also became concerned about how Captain Berard treated the
firefighters in his  department.

The Champlain Street Fire

25. Claimant testified that he had only seen one multiple story building
instantly collapse into  itself like a pancake during his career.  Chief
Contois has seen only a few partial building  collapses during his 30-year
career and admitted that such collapses are rare.

26. On May 4, 1994, claimant was serving as the officer on Engine 1 when he
got a call at  3:00 a.m. to respond to a fire at the intersection of
Champlain and Monroe Streets in  Burlington ("Champlain Street Fire").

27. The fire was particularly bad, a three-alarm fire that the firefighters
could see from the  fire station.  Two buildings, a two-story and a
three-story building, were fully involved.   More than 60 firefighters
responded.

28. Claimant's engine was the second to arrive.  He and his crew lay a hose
and then set  about to check for occupants and make sure that people were out
of the building.  They  worked to control the fire that had fully engulfed
the two buildings.  From his training  and experience, claimant knew not to
walk into a burning building because of the risk of  collapse.  He understood
that a building becomes structurally unsafe when it has been  burning freely
for 2 to 3 hours.

29. Chief Contois was the Battalion Chief for Training and Safety at the time
and was present  at the Champlain Street fire.  He testified that earlier in
the morning he and other  firefighters had entered the building and noticed a
buckling wall.  They immediately  vacated the building and informed the
incident commander of the structural weakness in  the building.  From that
point on, firefighters were instructed generally to stay out of the 
building, as it was structurally unsafe.  However, at one point Contois
noticed that a hose  was left in a building and was concerned that one end
was with a firefighter who might  not have heard the warning about the
structural integrity.  He then entered the building,  but found no
firefighter at the end of the hose.

30. Contois believes that a collapse zone was set up.  In addition, hose
lines and equipment  were picked up and personnel pulled back.  However, the
tower truck remained.

31. At about daybreak, claimant recalls, the fire was contained, buildings
were gutted and no  one was hurt.  He recalls walking to get some food and
noticing fellow firefighters inside  the building.  On his way back to the
engine, he peered into the building for a moment,  then turned and continued
on.  Almost immediately after he turned, he heard an eerie  creek, and then a
sudden loud "whoosh" sound.  He felt a breeze coming down on him  and debris
striking his coat.  When he turned and looked where he had been standing, he 
saw that the building had completely collapsed, pancake-style.

32. Claimant turned and saw part of the building leaning on the tower truck,
while the two  firefighters in the tower scrambled to get out.  He testified
that he knew workers were on  the other side of the building, but could not
see them.  He recalls running around the  building to see what he could do to
find out, and seeing several firefighters, including  Contois, coming out of
the windows of the two-story apartment connected to the three-story building
that had collapsed.

33. Chief Contois directly contradicted claimant's version of events.  He
testified that there  were no firefighters in the building at the time of the
collapse.  It is possible that the  claimant confused an incident earlier in
the night when he saw Contois , with his belief  that Contois and others were
coming out of windows of the adjacent building at the time  of the collapse.

34. No testimony was offered from any others at the scene to provide an
objective basis for  claimant's belief that someone was in the building at
the time of its collapse.  Neither  claimant nor his fellow firefighters were
in actual physical danger at the time of the  collapse.

35. After the building collapsed, nobody did a head count.  Claimant worried
that other  firefighters might not have made it out of the building.  It was
15 to 20 minutes before he  learned that everyone was safe.  In the interim,
claimant said he feared for the safety of  other firefighters, but not for
his own safety.  No evidence was offered to show that any  other firefighter
felt that colleagues were in danger and a headcount necessary.

36. Claimant was upset after the collapse to learn that his supervisors had
been aware of the  structural unsoundness of the building, but had never told
him.  At the same time, it is  obvious that he was aware that the building
was not stable.

37. Chief Contois further testified that he Burlington Fire Department
sometimes employs  Critical Incident Stress Debriefing ("CISD") techniques. 
In the two incidents he could  recall, young people died.  The first
instance, described as the "beltline incident,"  involved the death of four
young people.  Afterwards, debriefing was held to allow the  firefighters to
discuss their feelings.  The second incident, followed by two debriefing 
sessions, involved a murder scene where the firefighters were the first to
arrive and were  in actual physical danger.  Contois did not believe that the
Champlain Street fire  necessitated a debriefing session.  In his opinion, it
was not an experience beyond what a  firefighter can expect to encounter,
although it was not a daily event.

Champlain Fire Aftermath

38. On May 23, claimant consulted with his primary care physician with
complaints of chest  and nasal congestion of a two-day duration.  There is no
indication in the note for that  visit that claimant mentioned anything about
the Champlain Street fire.

39. Claimant testified that he became almost obsessive about safety issues
and the Champlain  Street fire in particular.  He could not stop thinking and
talking about the fire.  Although  he was glad nobody had been hurt, he could
not stop "playing" the fire over and over in  his head, thinking about what
could have happened.  Afterwards, he had nightmares  about the fire.

40. Within days of his scheduled vacation in June of 1994, claimant learned
from junior  firefighters, not his supervisor, that he had been transferred
to another shift.  The transfer  would have required claimant to supervise a
new crew of junior firefighters and to work  with Captain Berard whom he did
not like.  He testified that in the past, with a similar  transfer, he would
have taken the news in stride.  However, in this case he took the news 
extremely hard and was quite upset.  He felt low, belittled, useless,
insecure, and unsafe.

41. On June 6, 1994 claimant took a previously scheduled two-week vacation. 
Early in that  vacation, Captain Berard telephoned him at home with a demand
that he go in to work.   Claimant declined.  Captain Berard called again,
said he had bad news for claimant and  that he had to come in to work extra
duty.  Claimant again declined, stating that he was  on vacation.  He
testified that he reacted much more strongly than was his character.

42. In the weeks that followed, claimant became more and more upset.  His
nightmares  increased.  His sleep was disturbed.  He became irritable with
his family.

43. Observing her husband's change in demeanor, his struggle with nightmares,
and his  intrusive thoughts, Ms. Crosby urged him to get professional help. 
He contacted the City  and was linked to the Employee Assistance Program
("EAP").

44. On June 9, 1994 claimant saw EAP counselor Susannah Chamberlain.  She
described him  as "tearful, physically shaking, and often rambling in his
speech.  She noted that he had  spoken about a variety of stressful
work-related events, some recent, some from the past." 45. On June 13, Ms.
Chamberlain referred claimant to the Community Health Plan ("CHP")  for an
urgent visit and continuing follow-up.  CHP's notes indicate that claimant
had  recently been in a fire in a very dangerous situation and his
"higher-ups knew but didn't  tell him."  CHP assigned Wayne Suddaby, LSW, to
the case.

46. At his evaluation of claimant on June 14, Mr. Suddaby described him as
"anxious, sad,  frightened and depressed."  His history revealed difficulty
sleeping over the past 3 years,  feeling increasingly unsafe on the job over
the past three years, reported recent upheaval  at the Fire Department with
layoffs and departures, and a recent traumatic fire.  He noted  that claimant
"walked very rigidly and stiffly and broke into tears shortly after entering" 
the office.  Suddaby wrote that physically, Mr. Crosby appears emotionally
very brittle  and fragile, on the verge of cracking, "shell shocked." 
Identified stressors were upheaval  within the Fire Department, a change in
claimant's work, and "perhaps the most  significant recent stressor was the
fire that Mr. Crosby discussed in which he was in very  real danger, an
experience with potentially fatal consequences."  Claimant had lost 
confidence in his superiors and in his ability to be safe.

47. On June 16, Suddaby had a follow-up call with the EAP counselor
Chamberlain.  They  shared their concerns regarding a "PTSD type dx of Mr.
Crosby" and about his ability to  feel safe and be safe on the job.  They
agreed that claimant needed more time out of work  than his vacation would
allow, and that consideration of alternative career plans was in  order.

48. Claimant continued follow-up care with Wayne Suddaby.  In addition, on
June 28, he  saw his primary care physician, Dr. Joseph Capobianco, whose
note reflects claimant's  description of being nearly crushed by a burning
building which his supervisors knew  was unsound.  That note also reflects
claimant's report that he was having trouble with his  superiors at work, and
for the past couple of years had been out of the line of  communication,
which caused him some stress.  Dr. Capobianco diagnosed claimant with 
depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ("PTSD") and anxiety.  He
recommended an  indefinite leave of absence from work.

49. The Employer's First Report of Injury, dated July 26, 1994, identifies
the date of accident  as June 1994.  The form, signed by a representative of
the Vermont League of Cities and  Towns (VLCT), quotes the claimant as
stating "while trying to perform regular duties, a  stress level greater than
I could handle happened, involving fire calls &amp; upper  management."  Further,
claimant's report to VLCT, dated July 31, 1994, states that the  accident
happened due to "a build up of depression (stress) caused by work duties and 
emergency situations."

50. In the next two months, claimant continued to see Dr. Capobianco and
Wayne Suddaby,  both of whom noted improvement on medications, with
diminished nightmares and a  generally more positive outlook.  At the same
time, at home he continued to withdraw  from his family.

51. In August, the claimant wrote a seven-page statement in which he
described his work  history and the Champlain Street fire.  He expressed
concern about not receiving  information he thought he needed.  He also wrote
about the transfer from the shift he had  been working since 1989, the call
he received from Captain Berard when he was on  vacation and the help he
sought from the Employee Assistance program.  Claimant  expressed anger about
the fire, specifically that information about safety had not been  passed on
to him.  He wrote about visions of caskets, with himself in one of them.  He 
concluded by writing, "I feel as though I have done things over the years for
the  department which I never got credit for."  This made him feel "unwanted,
useless,  belittled."

52. In September, after continued therapy and difficult meetings at the Fire
Department,  claimant and his clinicians determined that he could return to
light duty work at any time,  with the goal of full time work by November.

53. Claimant returned to work, primarily doing office work, in mid-September,
1994.  At  sometime while he was doing light-duty work, he was assigned to
accompany a survivor  through the remains of a fire on the same block as the
Champlain Street fire.  A mother  and child had died in that fire.  Claimant
was uneasy as he went through the site and  suffered a setback afterwards.

54. Wayne Suddaby saw claimant for the last time on September 22 because a
change in  claimant's health insurance mandated a change of therapist.  That
day, Suddaby prepared  reports in which he recounted claimant's history and
opined that claimant's disability was  the result of work-related stress.

55. On October 11, the City of Burlington sent claimant to Dr. Susan Hetman,
the City's  Medical Examiner, in connection with questions surrounding
claimant's fitness for duty  and his application for disability retirement
benefits.  On the history sheet prepared for  that visit, claimant checked a
box for "depression or excessive worry" and listed as  medications he was
taking, prozac for depression and lorazapam for anxiety.  Dr. Hetman 
documented a history of increased anxiety related to observing tragedies,
including the  building collapse.  She certified that he was unable at that
time to perform the duties of  firefighter.

56. Dr. Curchin, who practices with Dr. Capobianco, documented claimant's
reaction to the  walk through the remains of a fire in his October 12, 1994
note.  Dr. Curchin's diagnosis  was PTSD and his recommendation was against
reintroducing claimant into fire fighting  duties.

57. In his second report, dated October 14, 1994, Suddaby explained that the
Champlain  Street fire alone did not cause claimant's cumulative stress, but
that it was the "acute  precipitant" to is disorder.  In addition to the
Champlain Street fire, claimant had related  other incidents, including the
car fire.  The stresses of fire fighting, in Suddaby's opinion,  had been
exacerbated by claimant's perception that safety protocols were lax in the
Fire  Department.

58. In mid-October, claimant stopped his light-duty work and resumed his sick
leave, unable  to continue at the Fire Department.  For reasons he could not
explain, claimant felt  uneasy, anxious, and unable to resume his fire
fighting job.

59. On four more occasions, Dr. Hetman reiterated her opinion that claimant
was unable to  return to fire fighting: at a November 8 visit; in a letter to
Chief Contois a week later; on  November 23 when she stated that he would not
return to work within six months of his  injury; and finally, on January 17,
1995 when she completed a questionnaire for the City.   In that
questionnaire, Dr. Hetman stated that claimant's condition prevented him from 
performing the essential functions of his job and would limit him for an
unknown period  of time.

Kenneth Kelly's Opinion 

60. Kenneth Kelly, who has been a psychologist since 1971, has concentrated
his practice on  the care of those in the police and firefighter professions
since the mid-1980s.  Mr. Kelly  had been a police officer himself.  He has
contracts with the South Burlington Police  Department, United States
Department of Immigration, Border Personnel, and the  Vermont State Police. 
His work involves doing post critical incident debriefing with  individuals
or groups, training and meeting with police, fire and rescue personnel.

61. Mr. Kelly saw claimant for the first time on November 2, 1994 at the
request of Susanne  Chamberlain at EAP.  He recounted claimant's recent
history, including a recent building  collapse "without a warning, .while a
number of personnel were inside ... after [which]  he observed a number
struggling out from within the structure."  Kelly also recorded  claimant's
belief that his commanders were unconcerned with safety.  He assessed 
claimant as follows:

Mr. Crosby presents many neurovegetative symptoms consistent with a 
diagnosis of major depression.  He also displays significant  symptomatology
indicative of PTSD.  The initial impression is that of both  depression and
PTSD resulting from the traumatic event in April of 1994  while on duty with
the Burlington Fire Department and its aftermath.

62. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder identified
and  described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder
(DSM-IV).   Mr. Kelly testified that most of the symptoms that support a PTSD
diagnosis may  be present, and require treatment, regardless of whether the
patient technically fits  completely within the criteria for that diagnosis.

63. Although Mr. Kelly had treated five or more Burlington firefighters in
the past,  claimant was the only one to whom he had assigned a diagnosis of
PTSD.

64. The claimant followed up with Ken Kelly on November 10, 1994.  Again,
they  discussed the events of May 4, 1994 and claimant's relationship to the
Fire Department.   Kelly explained his diagnoses of depression and PTSD and
established a treatment plan  of weekly counseling sessions, including
claimant's wife from time to time as  appropriate, and continuing medication.

65. For his psychopharmacologic evaluation, claimant saw Dr. Richard
Mickelsen and Dr.  Timothy Whitaker, psychiatric resident and attending
physician respectively, on  November 21, 1994.  Dr. Whitaker's assessment
reads as follows:

Mr. Crosby presents with significant neurovegetative symptoms  suggestive of
an ongoing major depressive episode, partially treated with  Prozac.  He also
presents with symptoms of PTSD, which to this point has  interfered with his
social and occupational functioning.  Currently it will  be important to
maximize his antidepressant in order to target his  depressive symptoms.  I
also believe that he would benefit from a low  dose of benzodiazepine and
behavioral therapy to target symptoms of  PTSD, as well as residual phobic
avoidance anxiety, and to specifically  work on desensitization techniques in
order to reintegrate into social and  work functioning.

66. Drs. Mickelsen and Whitaker recommended that Mr. Crosby undergo
behavioral therapy  with Dr. William McCann.

67. After several months of dealing with multiple providers, Susannah
Chamberlain, Wayne  Suddaby, Drs. Curchin and Capobianco, Drs. Whitaker and
Mickelsen, Dr. Hetman and  Ken Kelly, the claimant was quite reluctant to
tell his story yet again to another new  provider.  He elected to continue
treating with Ken Kelly and settled into a regular and  more focused
treatment regimen.  Mr. Kelly has continued to treat claimant to the 
present.

68. For the next several months, claimant saw Ken Kelly, sometimes alone,
sometimes with  his wife, two to three times per month.  Recurrent thoughts
of the events of the  Champlain Street presented a continual struggle for
him.

69. In March 1995, the claimant was formally terminated from the Fire
Department.  After  the termination, his agitation, anxiety and sleeplessness
spiked, but he seemed to recover  over the ensuing weeks.  Claimant returned
his equipment, but retained his helmet and  uniform badge.

70. On April 6, 1995, at the City's behest and in connection with claimant's
application for  disability retirement benefits, claimant saw Alan Rubin,
M.D., for an evaluation of his  ability to continue work as a firefighter. 
Dr. Rubin wrote:

I feel very strongly that Mr. Crosby is neither safe nor capable for working 
as a firefighter for the City of Burlington now or in the foreseeable future. 
As you know he is suffering from a depression and Post Traumatic Stress 
Disorder.  He is seeing Dr. Kurchin [sic] and a psychologist on a regular 
basis.  He has finally settled in after numerous therapists and treatment.  
He is taking Prozac 20mgs a day and Klonopin .5 mgs twice a day, which  is
controlling his anxiety.  He is beginning to be able to do the simplest 
things, feels well supported, and is not suicidal.  On today's visit, he is 
alternately tearful, frightened, anxious.  His speech is discontinuance and 
his body says depression. I feel very strongly that he is unable to continue 
his work as a firefighter much to his own and my disappointment.

71. Around April 1995, claimant cut back his visits to Ken Kelly to
approximately one visit  per month, in the belief that he was improving.  Dr.
Curchin and his colleagues continued  to monitor his medications.


72. When Kelly saw claimant on January 8, 1996, he noted some progress, but
also noted:

"Still somewhat withdrawn, difficulty sleeping, tendency to obsess about 
issues at the Fire Department and their response to Mr. Crosby's issues.  
Flashbacks &amp; poor sleep/sleep difficulties recur.  Self-confidence  somewhat
impaired.  "Emotionally fragile" at times.

73. In October 1996 Kelly noted a return of earlier PTSD and post-event
mistrust of the City  in connection with issues that had arisen in relation
to claimant's vocational  rehabilitation with the City.  Claimant tried to
cut back on his medications, but that  exacerbated his symptoms of anxiety,
distractibility, and nightmares.

74. All of the health care providers who treated claimant based the histories
they took on  facts presented by the claimant.

James C. Rosen, Ph.D.

75. Dr. James Rosen is a Vermont Licensed Clinical Psychologist and Professor
of  Psychology at the University of Vermont, where he has worked since 1976. 
His clinical  training, from 1972 to 1976, was in Nevada and Oregon where he
did psychotherapy and  assessments work with adults and children.  His
publications in professional journals are  extensive.

76. Dr. Rosen testified that the claimant experiences distressing emotional
symptoms of  depressed and irritable moods.  He testified further that
claimant possesses a long-standing pattern of maladaptive personality traits
that are unrelated to incidents at the  Burlington Fire Department.

77. In Dr. Rosen's opinion, strict compliance with the criteria identified in
the DSM IV is  required before a PTSD diagnosis can be made.  Those criteria
are: 1) exposure to a  traumatic event in which the person experienced or
witnessed an event that involved  actual or threatened death or serious
injury or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself  or others and a
response that involved intense fear, helplessness or horror; 2) the 
traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one of five ways including
recurrent and  intrusive recollections of the event and recurrent and
distressing dreams; 3) persistent  avoidance of stimuli associated with the
trauma; and 5) persistent symptoms of  increased arousal as  indicated by two
of the following: difficulty falling or staying  asleep, irritability,
difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance and exaggerated startle  response.  

78. Although he agreed claimant has some symptoms that are similar to Post
Traumatic  Stress Disorder, Dr. Rosen opined that he does not meet the
criteria for PTSD, especially  with regard to the claim that the collapsed
building incident in May 1994 was a  traumatic event.

79. In Dr. Rosen's opinion, claimant's mental condition is related to the
manner in which he  was transferred to the new shift and the calls from his
new superior, Captain Berard, to  do extra duty while he was on vacation.

80. Furthermore, Dr. Rosen testified, the claimant's mental health counseling
with Mr. Kelly  revealed long intervals between counseling sessions, which
are inconsistent with Kelly's  statement that the claimant was suffering from
a serious, work disabling psychological  disorder.  In addition, Rosen opined
that documentation in this case lacked the indicia  needed to trigger a PTSD
diagnosis and that the state of art treatment, behavioral  therapy, is not
being used.  Finally, he noted that a great number of claimant's sessions 
with Mr. Kelly focused on new employment and interpersonal difficulties, not
the Fire  Department.

81. Dr. Rosen further questions the diagnosis of PTSD, especially in light of
the fact that the  claimant maintained all of his equipment and gear for
nearly 11 months after the North  Champlain Street fire.  He was permanently
awarded his helmet and badge, actions  inconsistent with the avoidance of
stimuli expected of PTSD patients.

82. Dr. Rosen opines that the claimant is not impaired from work at the
present time.  He  does not lack motivation or confidence, which one would
expect in people with PTSD.   Nor does he have the nervousness or stress one
would expect.  In Dr. Rosen's opinion,  the employment issues claimant has
stem from voluntary withdrawals, conflict with  supervisors, and other
interpersonal conflicts.

83. Finally, Dr. Rosen testified that the 1991 car fire might have set the
stage for whether  the claimant could handle the stresses of being a
firefighter.  Employment records  beginning shortly after that fire and
claimant's own testimony reflect that he felt  increasingly unsafe on the job
thereafter and refused to work any extra duty.

Subsequent Employment

84. In the summer of 1995, claimant worked part-time at the Hampton Inn
driving the shuttle  bus, working at the continental breakfast buffet,
refilling empty food trays, cleaning and  performing various jobs.  At first,
he enjoyed the work and received positive feedback  from his supervisors and
customers.  At a visit to Dr. Curchin that summer, his Prozac  dosage was
reduced.

85. Eventually claimant developed conflicts with his supervisors and
dissatisfaction with the  job.  While at the Hampton Inn, claimant earned
$6.50 per hour and worked 30-40 hours  per week ($195-$260 per week).  At the
Fire Department, he earned about $620 per  week.  As the stresses at the job
at the Hampton Inn increased, claimant's distractibility,  concentration, and
sleep difficulties returned.

86. On October 20, 1995, claimant terminated his employment at the Hampton
Inn, reporting  to Ken Kelly that the pressures of pleasing his supervisor
had become too much.

87. After he left the Hampton Inn, claimant traveled with a group of high
school students as a  chaperone on a Project Harmony trip to Russia.  He
worked as a substitute teacher.  Claimant continued to substitute teach
through 1996, relying primarily on his disability  retirement benefits for
income through this period.  He also pursued vocational  rehabilitation
opportunities through the City throughout the year.

88. On January 12, 1997 Kelly determined that claimant still had not
completed his  recovery.  He recommended continued supportive treatment in
conjunction with  employment counseling and medical treatment.

89. Shortly thereafter, claimant accepted a temporary job in the security
department at St.  Michael's College, a job he found unsatisfying.  That job,
which paid $10 per hour for a  40-hour week, ended at the end of the school
year in 1997.  During the same time  period, claimant started volunteering,
then working, at the Humane Society.

90. In mid-July, claimant took a job at Trinity College where he worked with
clients,  employers and staff in connection with a program dealing with the
placement of  handicapped individuals in jobs.  The job was 75% time at $8
per hour.  Claimant  developed problems with his supervisor, who recommended
that he resign, which he  did.

91. Claimant's symptoms and memory of the events at the fire Department
returned in work  situations where he developed conflicts with his
supervisors.

92. In the winter of 1998 claimant worked for a short time in a dental
laboratory, earning $8  per hour.  In April 1999, claimant left the dental
lab job because of dissatisfaction and  lack of any opportunity for growth. 
He later received a conditional job offer at  Lenscrafters, but that offer
never materialized.  Next, he worked doing security and  maintenance at
Champlain Mill.  When he was offered and refused third shift work, he  left.

93. Claimant is currently unemployed.  His wife testified that his
restlessness with  employment is a new characteristic, which she never saw in
her husband before May 4,  1994.

Attorney's Fees and Costs

94. Claimant submitted: 1) his fee agreements with his attorney; 2) list of
work performed  from January 13, 1995 through November 20, 1995 with the
total hourly fee, but without  a breakdown indicating time for each task; 3)
specific itemization for 123.50 attorney  and 2 hour of paralegal hours
worked from May 30, 1996 through the 1999 hearing; and  4) evidence of
reasonable and necessary expenses totaling $1579.54.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

1.	In workers' compensation cases the claimant has the burden of
establishing all facts  essential to the rights asserted. Goodwin v.
Fairbanks, Morse and Co., 123 Vt. 161  (1963).  Sufficient competent evidence
must be submitted verifying the character and  extent of the injury and
disability, as well as the causal connection between the injury and  the
employment. Egbert v. Book Press, 144 Vt. 367 (1984).

2.	There must be created in the mind of the trier of fact something more
than a possibility,  suspicion or surmise that the incidents complained of
were the cause of the injury and the  inference from the facts proved must be
the more probable hypotheses.  Burton v. Martin  Lumber Co., 112 Vt. 17
(1941).  Furthermore, where the causal connection between an  accident and an
injury is obscure, and a layperson would have no well-grounded opinion  as to
causation, expert medical testimony is necessary.  Lapan v. Berno's Inc., 137
Vt.  393 (1979).  In this case for which professional expertise is essential,
the testimony from  two psychologists with divergent points of view has been
introduced.

Unusual Stress

3.	To recover for a work-related mental injury, a claimant in Vermont
must first  demonstrate that the stresses in the workplace are significant
and objectively real.   Gordon Little v. IBM, Opinion No. 13-97WC (June 30,
1997); Filion v. Springfield  Electroplating, Opinion No. 29-96WC (May 16,
1996).  Second, the claimant must show  that his illness is actually a
product of unusual or extraordinary stresses. Bedini v. Frost,  165 Vt. 167
(1996). Professor Larson notes that Vermont is one of fifteen states (FN1)
that require proof of unusual stress in mental-mental cases.  

4.	Stress from bona fide personnel actions, such as transfers or
disciplinary actions, is not  compensable. See, Wilson v. Quechee Landowners
Assoc., 9-87WC (Nov. 4, 1987).

5.	In Bedini, the Vermont Supreme Court approved the Department's test
for analyzing the  compensability of mental-mental claims.  It reasoned that
because basing an award on the  purely subjective perceptions of the mentally
disabled employee would place an  insurmountable burden on an employer,
greater objectivity is required when evaluating  the compensability of a
mental stress claim.  The Court, therefore, affirmed the  Department's
position that "in order for mental injury caused by stress at work to be 
compensable, a claimant must show that the stresses at work were of a
significantly  greater dimension than the daily stresses encountered by all
employees."  Id. at 169.  The  Court explained that the Department's standard
is supported by reasonable policy  considerations, including the inexplicable
etiology of most mental disorders.  Furthermore,

The unusual-stress standard also permits a more objective inquiry into the 
cause of the injury.  Greater objectivity is necessary in mental injury cases 
because the claimant's subjective impression that work-related stress  caused
her injury often forms the basis for the medical opinion that the  injury was
caused primarily by work-related stress. (Cite omitted.) 

Id. 

6.	Within the larger category of mental-mental claims, the claimant
distinguishes between  cumulative mental stress and a sudden stimulus that
leads to psychological injury.  Only  in the cumulative stress example, the
claimant argues, should the unusual stress analysis  apply.  He contends that
the policy considerations supporting the unusual stress standard  are absent
in the sudden stimulus case where problems with proof of causation are 
absent, the stimulus is identifiable and subjective perceptions are not
determinative.   Contrary to claimant's argument, however, the policy
considerations, especially the need  for objectivity, underlie both types of
cases as the instant case amply illustrates. 

7.	Plaintiff also argues that the Commissioner's standard abandons the
principle that an  aggravation or acceleration of a pre-existing condition
can constitute an injury that is  compensable under the workers' compensation
statute.  In Campbell v. Savelberg, the  Vermont Supreme Court held that "the
aggravation or acceleration of a pre-existing  condition can constitute
personal injury by accident under the Act."  139 Vt. 31, 35-36,  (1980).  As
the Bedini Court explained, mental injury claimants with pre-existing 
conditions can still receive compensation, but they, like all mental injury
claimants, must  show that the work-related stress was greater than that
experienced by all employees.  Bedini, 165 Vt. at 170-171.

8.	Next, we look to expert opinions that are essential to the
fundamental determinations in  this case. When considering the weight to be
given the testimony of the two experts,  consideration is given to their
education, training and experience, knowledge of the  patient, objective
support and comprehensive nature of the examination underlying their 
opinions.  In addition, we consider the objectivity of the experts
themselves.  Both Mr.  Kelly and Dr. Rosen have the credentials and
experience necessary to render an opinion  in this case.  Both conducted
comprehensive examinations.  Kelly has the distinct  advantage of having had
extensive experience with firefighters and years of treating this  patient. 
Rosen has the advantage of objectivity, untainted by the wish to help a
long-term  patient.  More importantly, however, Kelly's opinion is based on
the subjective history  claimant provided to him.  Although that history
necessarily forms the basis for clinical  treatment, it is too subjective to
stand in this forum without corroboration.  The facts  claimant told Mr.
Kelly about the Champlain Street fire were based on claimant's  perception
that firefighters were in actual danger.  Without any objective support and 
corroboration from any other witness, that subjective perception cannot be
accepted.  As  a result, Kelly's opinion loses its underpinnings for workers'
compensation purposes.

9.	Dr. Rosen's opinion, in contrast, objectively assesses the Champlain
Street fire as one that  did not threaten claimant's or any one else's life. 
It was only the claimant who believed  that someone was in the building and
that the firefighters were in danger at the time of  the collapse. Claimant's
subjective perception, sincere as it may be, fails to meet the  objectively
real standard.   

10.	Even if claimant had shown that his stress was significant and
objectively real, he would  have to prove that his illness is actually a
product of unusual or extraordinary stresses.   Before that issue can be
addressed, the control group for purposes of comparison must be  identified. 
The Bedini court referred to "work-related stress . greater than that 
experienced by all employees."  Yet it is inconceivable that the comparison
group be the  universe of workers with a size that would be "too amorphous to
be practical."  Bedini,  165 Vt. 172 (Johnson, J., dissenting). (Cite
omitted.) 

11.	The control group in this case must be an identifiable group that
shares the  responsibilities and stresses experienced by the claimant in his
work.  That group is one  of firefighters generally who share similar
physical and psychological stresses, and about  whom both parties testified. 
The group is not limited to Burlington firefighters. 

12.	Testimony on what was usual stress for firefighters came from Chief
Contois, the  claimant, and Ken Kelly.  Only about 10% of calls the
firefighters receive actually  involve fires.  Firefighters are involved in
situations involving fatal accidents, including  fires in which people die,
but not on a daily basis.  However, on a daily basis, they are  positioned to
respond, on a moment's notice, to whatever a call requires.  A response may 
require the physical exertion of carrying hoses and rescuing victims from
buildings and  the psychological stresses of property destruction and human
injury and death.  

13.	All firefighters responding to the Champlain Street fire, or to fires
of similar nature and  magnitude, were awakened in the middle of the night,
could see the fire from blocks  away, observed two buildings aflame, carried
hoses, and worked on the fire for hours.   They were warned of the potential
for collapse and knew from their training that  buildings on fire for hours
were in danger of collapsing.  In addition to the usual stresses  of that
situation, claimant had the additional subjective, but unfounded fear that
someone  was in the building.  It was that fear that prompted the reaction
and subsequent medical  treatment.

14.	Both parties find support for their respective positions in the City
of Fort Smith v. Brooks,  842 S.W. 2d. 463 (Ark. App. 1992), in which the
Arkansas Court of Appeals upheld the  claimant police officer's
stress-related worker's compensation claim.  The Court  considered the fact
that the event at issue triggered the memory of a similar past event.  
Similarly, claimant argues, the Champlain fire triggered in Mr. Crosby the
memory of the  gruesome car fire in 1991.  In Brooks, however, the memory of
a past traumatic incident  was only one part of a picture that included
objective evidence that claimant's work  duties were greater than what was
expected of similarly situated internal affairs officers.   The Court
determined that claimant met the test which was "whether the stress
constitutes  an abnormal working condition for that type of employment."  Id.
at 465.  This case lacks  the crucial element in Brooks, that claimant's work
itself was greater, and therefore more  stressful, than that of other
firefighters.

15.	The claimant in this case correctly and accurately argues that every
health care provider  who has treated him opines that he has suffered from
work related stress.  He has also  painted a particularly gruesome picture of
a car fire.  However, the sequence of events,  work history, lack of
corroboration, medical records and medical testimony have  convincingly shown
that the work-related stress claimant experienced stemmed from  normal
stresses in the workplace related to fighting a fire and a transfer as well
as  individual conflicts with his supervisors.  It is clear that the
Champlain Street fire was not  a stress of a significantly greater dimension
than the stresses encountered by other  firefighters.  And stress from bona
fide personnel matters is not compensable.   

16.	In sum, although claimant experienced stress, he has failed to prove
the first part of the  mental-mental stress inquiry, that the stress was
significant and objectively real.  The  building collapse by itself, the one
objective finding, is not sufficient. And claimant's  inaccurate belief that
someone might have been in the building was a personal, subjective  concern
that lacks the necessary objectivity.  Without objective evidence that he or 
another firefighter was actually in the zone of danger, he cannot meet the
"significant and  objectively real" prong of the analysis.  Nor has he proven
that he suffered objectively  real stress as a result of the Champlain Street
fire or that the fire represented an unusual  working condition for him
because that it was not a stress of a greater dimension than the  stresses
encountered by other firefighters.  Therefore, his claim fails.

ORDER:

Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, this claim is
DENIED.

Dated in Montpelier, Vermont, this 3rd day of December 1999.
