        Military Earthworks Terms</h1>
      <p><strong>Gabion</strong> - a large basket of interwoven vines and saplings used to strengthen 
        or shape an earthwork.  The gabion was set into position, then filled 
        with earth on site.  When gabions deteriorated, the fill collapsed into 
        shapeless mounds that can sometimes be identified in the field.</p>
      <p><strong>Glacis </strong>(Fr.) - outer edge of the ditch, or, by extension, the <i>field 
        of fire</i> of a fortification.  In permanent fortifications, the glacis 
        was shaped so that the ground rose gently as it approached the ditch to 
        protect and conceal the masonry revetment of the <i>scarp</i>.  In fieldworks, 
        time permitting, the glacis was sloped as a continuation of the angle 
        of the <i>superior slope</i> of the parapet.  Some surviving artillery 
        works have a shaped glacis, though it is fairly rare.</p>
      <p><strong>Gorge</strong> - entrance to a detached work, or simply the rear of the work, 
        as in, a lunette is open "at the gorge."  Leaving the rear of a work open 
        allowed defenders in a secondary line to fire into it in case it were 
        captured.  A wooden <i>stockade</i> was sometimes built to close off the 
        gorge.</p>
      <p ><strong>Grade</strong> - original ground level.  <i>Ditch</i> is below grade; <i>parapet</i> 
        is above grade.</p>
      <p><strong>Greater</strong> or <strong>Major Fieldworks</strong> - earthworks constructed with an exterior 
        or <i>front-ditch</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Gun Pit</strong> - an entrenched artillery position, a platform, <i>demilune</i> 
        or epaulement.</p>
      <p><strong>Gun Platform</strong> - a flat, usually rectangular, area behind a parapet on 
        which an artillery piece was positioned.  The platform surface was usually 
        floored with planks or split logs or <i>corduroyed</i> with logs placed 
        side by side.  A platform might be excavated or elevated relative to grade, 
        depending on whether it was firing through an <i>embrasure</i> or over 
        the parapet (<i>en barbette</i>).  The size of the platform is indicative 
        of the size of cannon it was intended to service (average 10 x 14 ft. 
        for a standard field piece).  Sometimes, a platform was edged by a narrow 
        drainage ditch or flanked by traverses.</p>
      <p><strong>Gun Ramp</strong> - a ramp constructed to move a cannon into firing position on 
        its platform; the ramp may ascend or descend to the platform from ground 
        level.  A gun ramp is a common surviving feature of artillery works.</p>
      <p><strong>Hasty Entrenchments</strong> - See <i>Rapid Entrenchments</i>.</p>
      <p ><strong>Holes and Pits </strong>-  foxholes and other personal defenses.  Single-man 
        skirmish pits or picket holes (foxholes) were typically about four feet 
        in diameter and 2-3 feet deep with the dirt thrown forward to form a low 
        parapet.  These holes were sometimes enlarged to hold two- or three-man 
        firing teams.  Pickets and skirmishers were deployed from 50-300 yards 
        in advance of the main line of defense at intervals of 5-15 yards.  This 
        regularity of placement is one of the principal indicators used in the 
        field to differentiate a picket or skirmish line from random holes caused 
        by tree-throw.  Interspersed along the skirmish line might be slit trenches, 
        which were short, discontinuous segments of parapet dug to cover 3-5 men.  
        Fire pits or mess holes might be dug out of the ditch behind the main 
        lines for cooking and sleeping.  "Officer holes" sometimes appear at regular 
        intervals from 5-10 yards behind the main lines, where file closers, usually 
        non-commissioned officers, were stationed to keep the rank and file in 
        line.  See <i>Dugouts and Bunkers</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Hornwork</strong> - detached earthwork formed of two adjacent <i>demi-bastions</i> 
        and two long <i>flanks</i> extending to the rear and inclining toward 
        the open <i>gorge</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Hurdle</strong> - <i>revetment</i> formed by interlacing vines or saplings through 
        a series of posts set upright against the <i>interior slope</i> of the 
        parapet.</p>
      <p><strong>Impoundment </strong>or<strong> Inundation</strong> - flooded ground in front of or within a fortification 
        for defensive purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>Improving</strong> - continuing to strengthen a system of rapid entrenchments 
        over time.  A simple rifle trench could be improved by widening the parapet, 
        adding traverses, excavating dug outs or fire pits behind the line, or 
        adding supply caches and a covered way to the rear.  Soldiers tended to 
        work on their entrenchments more or less continuously for as long as they 
        occupied them to make them safer, more comfortable, and more defensible.</p>
      <p><strong>Indented Line</strong> - See <i>Cremaillière Line.</i></p>
      <p><strong>Infantry Works</strong> - earthworks designed for defense by infantrymen.</p>
      <p><strong>Interior Slope</strong> - rear slope of the parapet, usually nearly vertical to 
        enable the defender to stand against it to fire over the parapet; often 
        faced by a <i>revetment</i> of logs, rails, planks, sod, wickerwork (called 
        hurdles), stones, sandbags, or other available materials. </p>
      <p ><strong>Internal Works</strong> - structures built within a larger earthwork, such as 
        magazines, bombproofs, and traverses.</p>
      <p><strong>Irregular Works</strong> - See <i>Regular and Irregular Works</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Keep</strong> - a blockhouse or redoubt built within a larger fort for use as 
        a place of final refuge or last-resort defense.  Also called a <i>citadel</i> 
        or <i>cavalier</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Lesser or Minor Fieldworks</strong> - earthworks constructed with an interior 
        or rear-ditch.  Because soldiers stood in the ditch to fire over the parapet, 
        the total relief rarely exceeded five feet.</p>
      <p><strong>Line of Battle</strong> - a tactical, linear formation of troops in which the 
        front ranks stood nearly shoulder to shoulder and the rear ranks stood 
        behind them in the intervals.  Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century armies 
        deployed in such dense lines in order to concentrate their musketry in 
        a single direction.  Since effective fire could be delivered only to the 
        front, the entire line of battle needed to shift position to change the 
        direction of fire.  Military earthworks reflected these linear tactics.</p>
      <p><strong>Lines at Intervals</strong> -- a line of mutually supporting detached works, typically 
        <i>redans</i>, <i>lunettes</i>, or <i>redoubts</i> that were not connected 
        by infantry parapets, also called a discontinuous line.  In theory, lines 
        at intervals allowed defenders greater mobility to conduct an <i>active 
        defense</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Listening Well</strong> - a shaft sunk during siege operations to detect an enemy's 
        attempt to tunnel under an entrenched position.  See <i>Mine</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Loop-hole</strong> - a narrow slit through which a weapon could fire.</p>
      <p><strong>Lunette</strong> (Fr.) - a detached earthwork, open to the rear, composed of two 
        <i>faces</i> forming a <i>salient angle</i> and two <i>flanks</i>, flanks 
        and faces being of nearly equal length<i>.  </i>Called a <i>bastion</i> 
        when connected to another lunette by a <i>curtain wall</i>.  Imprecisely 
        applied to a <i>demilune</i> or epaulement.</p>
      <p><strong>Magazine</strong> - a secure, water-tight place to store ordnance supplies; in 
        prepared works or fieldworks, a log or plank room or bunker covered over 
        with a thick layer of earth to protect ammunition from accidental discharge 
        or incoming artillery fire.  Most artillery fortifications occupied for 
        any length of time had at least one magazine, depending on the number 
        and types of guns.  A surviving magazine typically appears as a large 
        mound of earth, sometimes with a depression in the top where underlying 
        timbers have collapsed or in the side where the entrance used to be.  
        The entrance was to the rear, opposite any incoming fire.  Communication 
        trenches or at least unobstructed paths for runners lead from the entrance 
        to the gun platforms.  From visible remains, it is difficult to tell if 
        a mound was a magazine or a <i>bombproof</i>.  A single mound within an 
        artillery fortification is likely to have been a magazine, because engineers 
        generally protected ordnance before men. </p>
      <p><strong>Maham Tower</strong> - platform of logs, earth, and <i>gabions</i> constructed 
        during <i>siege operations</i> to allow besiegers to fire over the defenders' 
        parapets.</p>
      <p ><strong>Main Line of Defense</strong> - line along which the principal strength and effort 
        of the defenders was concentrated.</p>
      <p><strong>Merlon</strong> - section of parapet between two <i>embrasures</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Military Crest</strong> - shoulder of a hill or ridge rather than its actual crest.  
        The military crest is the highest contour of elevation from which the 
        base of its slope can be seen without <i>defilade</i>.  When surveying 
        an area for surviving earthworks, it is often useful to search along the 
        military crest. </p>
      <p><strong>Mine</strong> - tunnel dug beneath an enemy fortification, either to undermine 
        its foundations or to set off an explosion.  Mine tunnels are occasionally 
        discovered today in association with siegeworks, usually when a portion 
        of it collapses.  The best defense against enemy mining was counter-mining, 
        digging tunnels to intercept the enemy's mine.</p>
      <p><strong>Moat</strong> - ditch in front of an earthwork that was purposely filled with 
        water.</p>
      <p ><strong>Mutual Support</strong> - two artillery or infantry strong points, each within 
        the other's range and <i>field of fire</i> and able to assist the other 
        if attacked.  Engineers typically designed a fortification so that its 
        parts were mutually supporting.</p>
      <p><strong>No Man's Land</strong> - See <i>Zone of Contention</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Oblique Fire </strong>- incoming fire that strikes the parapet or line of battle 
        at an acute angle from left or right.  Incoming fire could be <i>direct, 
        enfilading, oblique, plunging, reversed, </i>or<i> ricochet.</i></p>
      <p><strong>Palisade</strong> (Fr.) - a phalanx of sharpened logs or <i>fraise</i>, anchored 
        in a shallow ditch and slanted to the front as an obstacle to advancing 
        infantry.  Also a wall of logs or <i>stockade</i>.</p>
      <p ><strong>Pan Coupé</strong> (Fr.) -- a short straight stretch of parapet constructed across 
        the capital of a salient angle, having the effect of reducing the angle's 
        <i>sector without fire</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Parade </strong>or <strong>Parade Ground</strong> - flat assembly area within a larger permanent 
        or semi-permanent fortification; often adjacent to barracks or other garrison 
        buildings; sometimes improved by leveling and draining.</p>
      <p><strong>Parallel</strong> - a parapet thrown up to confront defenses when conducting a 
        siege by <i>regular</i> <i>approaches</i>.  The First Parallel was constructed 
        out of range of the enemy's guns.  <i>Saps</i> were pushed forward fifty 
        or a hundred yards to construct a Second Parallel, and so on, until reaching 
        the ditch of the enemy fortification. Imprecisely applied to describe 
        a <i>curtain wall</i>.</p>
      <p ><strong>Parallel Fire</strong> - fire directed across the front of an entrenched line 
        or line of battle.</p>
      <p><strong>Parapet  </strong>(It. parapetto, shield the chest) - a linear mound of earth 
        built to defend against incoming fire.  The thickness of a parapet was 
        determined by the armament that it was expected to withstand-for musketry, 
        5-7 feet; field artillery, 8-16 feet; for siege or naval guns, up to 35 
        feet.  The parapet consisted of an <i>interior slope</i>, usually revetted 
        with logs, planks, rails, stones, sandbags, or fascines, so as to be nearly 
        vertical, <i>the superior slope </i>or<i> crest</i>, which inclined slightly 
        downward toward the enemy, and the <i>exterior slope</i> or outer face, 
        which took the brunt of enemy fire.  The exterior slope typically inclined 
        45 degrees, the natural angle of repose for most soils.</p>
      <p><strong>Passive Defense </strong>- strategy of holding an entrenched position and awaiting 
        the enemy's attack.</p>
      <p><strong>Peneplein</strong> (Fr.) - flat interior of an enclosed earthwork, synonymous 
        in usage with <i>terreplein.</i></p>
      <p><strong>Permanent Fortifications</strong> - defenses constructed to defend towns, garrisons, 
        depots or other fixed positions that were intended to last for a long 
        time with minimal repair.  A fort's ramparts could be constructed entirely 
        of stone and brick or, if built largely of earth, would have masonry revetments 
        within and without to deter erosion.</p>
      <p><strong>Picket</strong> - a guard or <i>vidette</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Picket Holes </strong>or <strong>Skirmish Pits</strong> - See <i>Holes and Pits</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Picket Line</strong> - a row of guards, or videttes, spread out in intervals and 
        formed in advance of the main line to provide warning of an attack; a 
        row of individual foxholes entrenched by the pickets.  Picket lines were 
        advanced anywhere from 50-300 yards in front of the main lines, depending 
        on the terrain and proximity of the enemy.</p>
      <p><strong>Platform</strong> - See <i>Gun Platform</i>.</p>
      <p ><strong>Plunging Fire</strong> - fire directed from higher to lower ground. </p>
      <p ><strong>Postern</strong> - See <i>Sally Port</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Prepared</strong> or <strong>Provisional Entrenchments</strong> - See <i>Deliberate Entrenchments</i>.  
      </p>
      <p><strong>Priest Cap </strong>- a detached earthwork consisting of two <i>faces</i> joined 
        in a <i>reentrant</i> and two long <i>flanks</i> extending toward the 
        rear and inclining away from the open gorge.  The design served to converge 
        the fire of the two faces on a specific target to the front.  The severity 
        of the re-entering angle determined the distance to the point of convergence.</p>
      <p><strong>Profile</strong> - cross-section of an earthwork.  The higher and wider the parapet, 
        the wider and deeper the ditch, the "stronger" the profile.  A simple 
        rear-ditched rifle trench had a "weak" profile.</p>
