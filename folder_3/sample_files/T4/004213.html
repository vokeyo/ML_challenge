                Currents Form</strong></p>
            <p>Coastal scientists have been
              investigating rip currents
              for more than 75 years. This
               research has been
              conducted through field
              observations and measurements,
              laboratory measurements and
              wave tank experiments, and
              computer and numerical modeling.
              The mechanics of rip current
              development are complex and
              involve interactions between
              waves and currents, waves and
              water levels, waves and the
              shape of the nearshore bottom
              (bathymetry), as well as wave-wave
              interaction.</p>

            <p>Rip currents can occur along
              any coastline that features
              breaking waves. Scientific
              investigations of wave and
              current interactions along
              the coast have shown
              that rip currents are likely
              present on most beaches every
              day as a component of the complex
              pattern of nearshore circulation.              </p>
            <p>As waves travel from deep
              to shallow water, they eventually
                break near the shoreline.
              As waves break,
                they generate currents that
                flow in both the offshore
              (away from the coast) and the
              alongshore directions. Currents
              flowing away from the coast
              are called rip currents. </p>            <p>Rip
                currents are a result of
                complex interactions between
                waves, currents, water levels
                and nearshore bathymetry.
                These  current systems
                form an integral part of
                nearshore circulation patterns
                such as  alongshore and
                cross-shore (onshore/offshore)
                water motion. Along all coastlines,
                nearshore circulation cells
                may develop when waves break
                strongly in some locations
                and weakly in others. These
                 weaker and
                stronger wave breaking patterns
                are most often seen 
                on beaches with a sand bar
                and channel system in the
                nearshore zone. A rip current
                forms as the narrow, fast-moving
                section of water travels
                in an offshore direction.
                Rip currents can also result
                from a wave's natural variability
                or when a current traveling
                along the shoreline encounters
                a structure such as a groin
                or jetty and is forced offshore. </p>
            <p>Rip current strength and speed
               varies. This variability makes
               rip currents 
              especially dangerous to uninformed
              beachgoers. Rapid fluctuations
              or pulses in wave groups can
              quickly generate rip currents
              with velocities measured
              up to 8 feet per second. </p>
            <p><strong>Waves, Currents
                  and Water Level Variations </strong></p>
            <p>As waves break along a shoreline
              or over a sandbar, an increase
              in water level occurs. This
              increase in water level is
              known as set-up. The increase
              in water level is especially
              evident as waves break over
              a sandbar, resulting in an
              increased set-up of water on
              the landward side of the bar.
              Thus, waves breaking over a
              sandbar can result in mass
              transport of water between
              the bar and the shoreline.
              There is usually a difference
              in set-up (water heights) between
              the bar, where the waves are
              breaking strongly, and the
              channel between bars, where
              little or no wave breaking
              occurs. </p>
            <p>One of the ways this water
              returns seaward is through
              rip currents, which flow seaward
              against the incoming waves.
              This seaward flow of water
              typically occurs through a
              break in the sandbar, where
              water is channelized into a
              narrow current known as a rip
              current. </p>

            <p>The shape of the shoreline
                      and nearshore bottom
                    (bathymetry) may influence
                    rip current development.
                    In regions where the
                coastline is characterized
                by cuspate features (i.e.
                the shoreline is “scalloped”),
                rip current may be found
                      between the cusps.
                Examples of this type of
                shoreline can be found in
                some portions of the Florida
                      coast (e.g. Perdido
                Key), and in some locations

                      coast (Monterrey Bay). </p>

            <br><p>The presence of longshore
              bars can also have an impact
              on rip current development
              and location. In some geographic
              locations, the nearshore bottom
              may be characterized by fixed
              structures such as reefs. In
              other areas, nearshore bathymetry
              is more ephemeral, with offshore
              sand bars constantly changing
              their shape and location. Along
              shorelines where sand is deposited
              in an offshore bar, the rip
              current often flows through
              a low spot or channel cut through
              the sandbar. </p>
            <p><strong>Man-Made Structures </strong></p>
            <p>Rip currents may occur at fixed locations such as groins, jetties, piers, or other man-made
              structures where water can be funneled out to sea in a narrow channel. In coastal
              areas with structures, rip current may result when currents running parallel to the shore
              are deflected offshore by the structure. </p>

            <br><p>As waves approach the shoreline, they usually break at an angle, generating a longshore current
              that flows parallel (along) the beach. When the longshore current (moving along the shore)
              encounters coastal structure (such as a groin, jetty, or pier) it is deflected in an offshore direction. This offshore-directed
              flow of water is called a rip current. </p>

                  and Wave-Current Interaction:
                  Generation of Circulation
                  Patterns </strong></p>
            <p>Rip currents can develop due
              to interactions between waves
              and currents, even in the absence
              of nearshore sand bars and
              without shoreline or bathymetric
              influence on their formation.
              Breaking waves force narrow
              regions of offshore-directed
              flows, known as rip currents.</p>
            <p>As waves break near the shore,
              complex wave interactions may
              generate circulation patterns
              that result in the formation
              of rip currents, sending water
              back out to sea. Along open
              coasts (coasts without sand
              bars), rip currents are caused
              by variations in breaking waves,
              with waves breaking strongly
              in some locations and less
              strongly in others. These variations
              generate circulation cells
              causing water to be deflected
              offshore as a rip current. </p>

            <p><strong>Rip Current Size and
                Speed </strong></p>
            <p>Rip currents can occur along
              any coastline with breaking
              waves. Although rip currents
              are often present daily on
              many beaches, the velocities
              may be too slow to be a threat
              to experienced swimmers. However,
              their inherent variability
              makes them especially dangerous
              to unwary or uninformed beachgoers.
              Changes in the size of the
              incoming waves can cause pulses
              in the strength of a rip current,
              which can be dangerous to all
              swimmers and anyone entering
              the surf. </p>
            <p><strong>Wave Groups and Rip
                Current Pulsations </strong></p>
            <p>Rip currents are very unsteady
              and may increase in strength
              within a short time frame (a
              few minutes) because of larger
              incoming wave groups or current
              instabilities. It is extremely
              important to understand that
              changes in rip current velocity
              can occur very rapidly with
              random increases in incoming
              wave heights and water levels.
              Water depths can rapidly increase
              in rip current channels, catching
              unwary beachgoers and swimmers
              off-guard. If the higher waves
              and water levels sweep bathers
              off their feet, they may be
              transported offshore by the
              rip current. </p>
            <p><strong>Rip Current Characteristics
                and Velocities </strong></p>
            <p>Although rip currents are
              not caused by tides, the water
              level (tide elevation) at the
              coast may have an impact on
              rip current speed and strength.
              Generally, rip current velocities
              increase as water levels (tide
              elevation) decrease. </p>
            <p>Rip current velocities also
              typically increase as wave
              heights increase. An increase
              in the height of incoming waves
              can result in sudden increases
              in water depth and rip current
              velocities. These sudden changes
              or pulses in water depth and
              current speed can catch bathers
              off-guard. Rip current pulsations
              are extremely dangerous to
              all swimmers! </p>
            <p>While average rip current
              velocities of 1 to 2 feet per
              second do not pose serious
              hazards to strong swimmers,
              rip currents may rapidly reach
              or exceed velocities of 3 feet
              per second. Also, rapid fluctuations
              or pulses in wave groups can
              quickly generate rip currents
              with extreme velocities that
              have been measured up to 8
              feet per second – this is faster
              than an Olympic swimmer can
              sprint! If a swimmer is caught
              in a rip current, attempting
              to swim directly back to shore
              against the seaward flowing
              current can result in exhaustion
              and possible drowning. </p>
            <p>Rip currents are usually narrow
              (~ 20 to100 feet in the alongshore
              direction), may extend hundreds
              of feet offshore, and generally
              span the entire water column.
              However, offshore, or outside
              the surf zone, they tend to
              be confined near the surface. </p>
            <p>Rip currents do not pull people
              under water – they pull people
              away from shore. Drowning deaths
              usually occur when people are
              unable to keep themselves afloat
              and swim back to shore. This
              may be due to fear, panic,
              exhaustion, a lack of swimming
              skills, or any combination
              of these factors. </p>
            <p><strong>Rip Current Duration </strong></p>
            <p>Some shorelines are characterized
              by permanent rip currents which
              may be found in a fixed location
              such as a break in a reef or
              other hard structure. Some
              rip currents are persistent,
              lasting for many days or months
              in one location. Rip currents
              may also migrate along a stretch
              of coastline. Rip currents
              may also be ephemeral, forming
              quickly and lingering for a
              few hours or days before dissipating
              and disappearing. </p>

            <p><strong></strong>Rip currents
              are not rip tides. A specific
              type of current associated
              with tides may include both
              the ebb and flood tidal currents
              that are caused by egress and
              ingress of the tide through
              inlets and the mouths of estuaries,
              embayments, and harbors. These
              currents may cause drowning
              deaths, but these tidal currents
              or tidal jets are separate
              and distinct phenomena from
              rip currents. Recommended terms
              for these phenomena include <em>ebb
              jet </em>, <em>flood jet </em>,
              or <em>tidal jet </em>. </p>
            <p><strong>What is Undertow? </strong></p>
            <p>Undertow, an often misunderstood
              term, refers to the backwash
              of a wave along the sandy bottom.
              After a wave breaks and runs
              up the beach face, some of
              the water percolates into the
              sand, but much of it flows
              back down the beach face creating
              a thin layer of offshore-moving
              water with a relatively high
              velocity. This backwash can
              trip small children and carry
              them seaward. However, the
              next incoming wave causes higher
              landward velocities, pushing
              them back up on the beach.
              Undertow does not pull you
              under water or out to sea. </p>
