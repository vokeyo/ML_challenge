<H1>National Library of Medicine Update 1998</H1>
<H2>Highlights from the Medical Library Association Annual Meeting</H2>
<HR>
<P>Staff from NLM provided the annual update on NLM programs and priorities.  Below are some highlights from the presentation at MLA.  
<UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>Priorities for the coming year will be to: strengthen existing services while transitioning the library's online systems to a Web-based, client-server environment; ensure that all NN/LM members are connected to the Internet by the year 2000.
<LI>With an expected budget increase for the coming fiscal year, consumer health information will be a major focus.  Internet access makes the mounting of consumer materials platform independent and therefore more cost effective.  While NN/LM members have been involved with consumer health for a long time, this is a new area for NLM - their legislative mandate and their Board of Regents have traditionally restricted NLM   to targeting healthcare professionals.  The library needs to identify more quality consumer resources and to discover the best way to communicate with patients, their families, and the general public.  NLM will also form new partnerships, with public libraries, and will look to network members for assistance and advice.  A description was provided of the consumer health/public library project being funded by NLM (see RML Directors' Meeting at MLA, page 7,  for further details).
<LI>The next generation Internet:  In trying to project possible future applications for the Internet five years from now, NLM has issued planning grants for ideas which are future oriented.
<LI>International programs: Document delivery to support the library's international programs has been self-sustaining until now, but price increases may be needed.  There has been a big increase in international use of and contributions to the human genome project.  
<LI>Internet connections survey: National results from this 1997 survey, which went to all NN/LM members will be published in the <I>Bulletin of the Medical Library Assciation (BMLA)</I>. [For more details, see <I>Latitudes</I> vol.7 no.1 ]  Regions are currently following up with unconnected libraries to help them get a connection (see  page 13).  One approach is the development of a packet of information to assist network libraries in getting a connection, as well as a mailing to inform hospital administrators of the benefits of the Internet.  Institutions which are underconnected will also be assisted with upgrading their equipment.  As a follow-up, a random survey of Network members will be conducted next year to include non-respondents of the 1998 survey, the unconnected, and new members.  NLM also surveyed public libraries; 72% are now connected, though only 60% provide public access to the Internet.
<LI>A summary of the &quot;Bethesda 15&quot; meeting was provided, where librarians gathered at NLM to review PubMed and IGM search capabilities and the need for training in these Web-based interfaces (see page 14  for further details).
<LI>Over 900 people were trained between January and April 1998 by the National Online Training Center with the newly developed classes. Both the Transition and Fundamental  manuals have been uploaded onto the Web; an HTML version is in progress and a PowerPoint representation of the class is being developed.  Because of the need, NLM is making funding available for extra training and can pay an institution for the use of their room if it will add a strategic location where training is badly needed.  
<LI>NLM Associate Program: the program, which accepted eight individuals this year, has added an optional second year to be experienced off the NLM campus.  This is to allow the associate to work on a collaborative project at another institution.  Library directors were asked to consider releasing staff to participate in the associate program.  
<LI>The NLM Informatics program at Woods Hole has been well attended: one third of the participants are librarians.
<LI>Interlibrary Loans:  a new analysis of ILL requests shows similar data to prior studies.  Libraries are doing a good job vis-&#224;-vis fair use.  NLM reminded librarians to review their ILL data to see if titles need to be added - nursing titles have been requested most frequently.
<LI>Loansome Doc: Many international requests for document delivery are coming in through the Web.  The RMLs will be collecting information on libraries willing to serve international users of IGM and PubMed.  A list will be mounted on the Web.  NLM is reviewing the cost of its fax document delivery, since it is very costly to some international users.  The library is promoting Ariel and other electronic delivery methods.
<LI>Digital Manuscript Project: the project to digitize NLM manuscripts involves the History of Medicine Division, Library Operations, and Lister Hill.  The focus currently is on digitizing the manuscripts of NIH's Nobel scientists.
<LI>Intuitive searching for librarians vs. researchers and clinicians: NLM is looking at how to organize its data to make the best use of technology.  In  the  Web environment, searchers need to think about a search by topic rather than by where data are retrieved.  The interface changes so quickly, it is hard to keep up, and training is a problem.  In this environment, self-paced learning is important.  Searchers need to be open to changes.  NLM needs feedback on how to help librarians remain the experts in this area.  What would be    most    helpful    in  keeping librarians trained?
<LI>Under the new OPAC, the cataloging system at NLM will adopt MEDLINE's MeSH structure for the subject analysis of monographs.  Records will include publication type.  Searchers will need to restructure their search strategies.
<LI>Librarians who want to contact NLM should   take advantage of  their customer service     line  (888-346-3656), and e-mail address (<A HREF="mailto:custserv@nlm.hih.gov">custserv@nlm.hih.gov</A>).
