<HEADLINE> FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo asthma drug wi
ns US approval </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By DANIEL GREEN </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glax
o has belatedly won US approval for one of its most important products
of th
e 1990s, the inhaled asthma treatment Serevent.
The US Food and Drug Adminis
tration had been expected to approve the drug in
December and Glaxo shares f
ell when this did not happen.
After Serevent's approval yesterday, the share
s rose 15p to end the day with
a net fall of 2p at 664p.
The drug is importa
nt to Glaxo because it is a successor to Ventolin, the
long standing big sel
ler in asthma treatment. Such respiratory treatments
are second in importanc
e only to ulcer drugs in Glaxo's therapeutic
portfolio, accounting for almos
t one quarter of total sales.
The older drug has now lost much of its patent
 protection and the company is
relying on Serevent to underpin its position 
in the market.
The drug was approved in Europe in 1991 and should eventually
 reach sales of
Pounds 350m a year, according to James Capel, the broker. In
 the last full
year, Serevent sold Pounds 73m while Ventolin sales were wort
h Pounds 484m.
The drug had a setback last month, however, when Italian gove
rnment
healthcare reforms favoured Ventolin by excluding Serevent from a lis
t of
drugs the government would pay for. Glaxo lodged an appeal against the

ruling.

The drug is importa

long standing big sel

are second in importanc

The older drug has now lost much of its patent
 protection and the company is

The drug was approved in Europe in 1991 and should eventually

The drug had a setback last month, however, when Italian gove

healthcare reforms favoured Ventolin by excluding Serevent from a lis

ruling.

<HEADLINE> FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo asthma drug wi
ns US approval </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By DANIEL GREEN </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glax
o has belatedly won US approval for one of its most important products
of th
e 1990s, the inhaled asthma treatment Serevent.
The US Food and Drug Adminis
tration had been expected to approve the drug in
December and Glaxo shares f
ell when this did not happen.
After Serevent's approval yesterday, the share
s rose 15p to end the day with
a net fall of 2p at 664p.
The drug is importa
nt to Glaxo because it is a successor to Ventolin, the
long standing big sel
ler in asthma treatment. Such respiratory treatments
are second in importanc
e only to ulcer drugs in Glaxo's therapeutic
portfolio, accounting for almos
t one quarter of total sales.
The older drug has now lost much of its patent
 protection and the company is
relying on Serevent to underpin its position 
in the market.
The drug was approved in Europe in 1991 and should eventually
 reach sales of
Pounds 350m a year, according to James Capel, the broker. In
 the last full
year, Serevent sold Pounds 73m while Ventolin sales were wort
h Pounds 484m.
The drug had a setback last month, however, when Italian gove
rnment
healthcare reforms favoured Ventolin by excluding Serevent from a lis
t of
drugs the government would pay for. Glaxo lodged an appeal against the

ruling.

<TEXT>
Birds in Nevada now have new homes
 courtesy of Coeur d'Alene Mines. The
company is attaching lightweight nesti
ng boxes to its claim posts - the
posts used to mark boundaries when mining 
companies stake their claims.
The idea was developed by Rob Berry, senior la
ndsman with Coeur d'Alene's
exploration subsidiary. He noticed that the holl
ow plastic boundary posts
often claimed more than mining land. Birds slipped
 into the open ends of the
posts, sometimes to nest in them, and could not a
lways escape.
Rather than simply capping the posts, Berry developed the bird
 boxes, which
are folded together from one piece of corrugated cardboard and
 attached with
some simple hardware. The boxes are light enough for mineral 
exploration
teams - who frequently hike many miles into remote areas - to ca
rry several
at a time.
Berry called on experts at the Nevada Department of W
ildlife to help design
the nesting boxes, which were first tested last year 
at the group's
Rochester mine in Nevada, the largest primary silver mine in 
the US. Now
schools and Scout groups are also using them.
Berry's boxes are 
suitable for small birds, bluebirds and wrens, but larger
ones have been des
igned to accommodate kestrels, a species of owl and wood
ducks.
This, howeve
r, is not just a simple story about a nature-lover and a good
idea. Dead bir
ds are a very big issue at open-pit mines in the US. Mining
companies are sp
ending millions of dollars to make sure that they do not
fall foul of legisl
ation such as the US Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The act
makes it illegal for
 any company or mine to kill migrating water fowl and
every death has to be 
reported.
The mining method that causes difficulties is called heap leaching
. Ore is
placed in a heap on an impermeable plastic pad and a weak cyanide s
olution
is sprinkled over it. The solution collects at the bottom after perc
olating
through the ore and dissolving much of the metal.
This very low-cost
 process has enabled gold and silver to be won from rock
containing very lit
tle of the precious metals - typically well under one
ounce of gold in every
 tonne of ore - and it contributed to the tremendous
upsurge of gold mining 
activity in Australia as well as North America in the
1980s.
But tailings (w
aste), discharged into ponds after the gold has been
separated from the solu
tion, still contains cyanide which takes some time to
lose its toxicity in t
he sunlight. Many of the US gold mines using heap
leaching are in desert are
as, and when birds in the desert see a patch of
blue water there is little t
hat can be done to stop them if they want to
drop in for a drink.
Most of th
e ponds are too large to be satisfactorily covered by netting  -
heavy winte
r snows tend to tear it. But at the Rochester mine Coeur d'Alene
tried this 
and various other methods to keep birds away from the cyanide
solution. To s
care the birds away, strips of polished aluminium were
employed as well as p
ropane cannons that exploded compressed gas with a loud
bang at intervals. N
one of these strategies worked perfectly.
Now the company is pioneering a 'c
losed loop' leaching system that does away
with the open ponds. Instead, the
 cyanide solution circulates without seeing
the light of day, and the 'pregn
ant' or metal-bearing solution is held in a
closed tank before processing. E
ven the drip-irrigation facility is buried
below the surface of the heap of 
ore on the leach pad.
All this obviously helps to protect birds and other wi
ldlife. But it has
also reduced Rochester's costs by enabling leaching to go
 on year-round
without the heap freezing and by reducing the amount of cyani
de and water
used.
Coeur d'Alene is now leaching out the same amount of meta
l with 4,000
gallons of solution, against the previous 7,000 gallons.
Dennis
 Wheeler, Coeur d'Alene's president, says the system helped to reduce
the ca
sh costs of production at Rochester from Dollars 3.76 a troy ounce in
1991 t
o Dollars 3.22 last year - or by more than 14 per cent.
He says: 'Environmen
tal protection is a key element in the mining industry
and it will remain so
.' So he encourages a positive approach throughout the
company - an approach
 that led Berry to come forward with his bird house
initiative and resulted 
in Coeur d'Alene winning several environmental
awards in the past five years
.
This helps create a positive image for the mining industry in its battles

with environmentalists. Wheeler suggests: 'Mining is a compatible use of the

land and fully in keeping with the US tradition of multiple use of our
land
s.'
He also insists that his shareholders recognise that money spent on
envi
ronmental actions is well-spent. 'Our shareholders want to be part of an
org
anisation that recognises a responsibility to the environment.'

<HEADLINE> FT  31 JUL 92 / Management: Prepared for the worst - 
Planning for a crisis </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By PAUL TAYLOR </BYLINE>
<TEXT
>
What happens when a briefcase containing company secrets goes missing, a
b
lackmailer laces the company's top-selling food product with poison, or
toxi
c factory waste escapes threatening an environmental disaster?
For most comp
anies a crisis like this will never happen. But when disaster
strikes, the c
onsequences can be so dire, that managers are starting to lay
contingency pl
ans, just in case.
Crisis Planning has only recently emerged as a management
 issue, in response
to the headline-grabbing disasters in the past decade. A
mong those judged to
have been well handled were the lacing of Johnson and J
ohnson's Tylenol
capsules with cyanide in the US, and the British Midland ai
r disaster at
Kegworth in Leicestershire.
In contrast, the Bhopal toxic gas 
disaster involving a Union Carbide plant
in India, and the King's Cross unde
rground fire are often cited as examples
of poor crisis planning and managem
ent.
Few businesses are immune from crisis, but research suggests even fewer
 have
a strategy for dealing with disasters. A recent survey conducted by
Al
exander Stenhouse, the insurance brokers and risk management experts,
found 
that only one in four UK companies had a strategy for dealing with a
product
-tampering crisis and only one in three had developed a plan for
minimising 
the risk resulting from an environmental crisis.
There is an understandable 
reluctance to confront an issue which may never
happen. However, there is ev
idence that the worst time to learn how to
manage a crisis is during a crisi
s itself.
For this reason a number of consultants have begun to sell crisis 
management
services. One such, dubbed Total Crisis Management (TCM), is offe
red by a
group of four firms comprising Alexander Stenhouse, the London law 
firm,
Denton Hall Burgin & Warren, Ogilvy Adams & Rinehart, the public relat
ions
consultants, and Touche Ross, the management consultants.
The four firm
s promise a full crisis planning and management service, which
begins with a
n internal risk review and includes a 24-hour crisis telephone
hot line.
The
 TCM group says a simple problem can become a crisis if the company is
unpre
pared.
Although the TCM partners acknowledge a crisis cannot always be avoid
ed,
they insist the best way to survive is to plan ahead. But they also caut
ion
against rigid responses. 'Simply having a crisis manual may be worse tha
n
useless,' the experts say. 'No-one will have read it. The crisis you are
h
andling won't be in it and you won't have time to wade through it when
insta
nt decisions are needed.'
So how can you prepare for a crisis? The first ste
p is to bring together the
expertise - internally or from outside - to defin
e possible crises and to
explore the risks. Then planning, communications an
d training packages can
be put in place as 'insurance' for the future. There
 are three main stages:
Crisis preparation: Undertake an audit of the releva
nt risks, including
environmental dangers, legal and security threats, and p
olitical or other
external pressures. Then review risk control policies and 
prepare a crisis
manual as a basis for training and simulation exercises. It
 should describe
the authority, the aim and the staffing of a crisis managem
ent team. It
should contain relevant telephone numbers of experts, and make 
clear who is
supposed to be doing what.
Crisis handling: The team must be as
sembled, and the situation assessed
coolly and professionally. Communication
 is the most important item.
Companies must be ready to give and to receive 
information from a wide
variety of sources.
A recent study by Alexander & As
sociates, management consultants, shows that
most companies communicate poor
ly with their regulatory bodies, concentrate
on the shareholder at the expen
se of the customer, and have feeble systems
for internal communication. Comp
anies should ensure all the media's
questions are answered and should liaise
 with investigatory bodies to
protect and minimise exposure to criminal or c
ivil liabilities.
Crisis after-care: When the dust settles, do not relax and
 lose the
initiative. There will be many lessons to learn and opportunities 
to take
after a crisis. The review should begin as soon as the crisis is ove
r. Staff
should be reassured that the point of the review is not to find cul
prits,
but to improve the working of the plan.

<HEADLINE> FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (22): Ex
panding, but it's a gamble - Korea: The ambitions of the country's Big Three
 </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By JOHN BURTON </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean car ma
nufacturers are taking perhaps their biggest gamble since
the industry was e
stablished in the 1960s by doubling their production
capacity to at least 6m
 vehicles annually by 2000, with a third of this
amount manufactured abroad.

The rapid expansion is risky when the global car industry is already
strugg
ling with surplus production. But Korea's leading industries have
traditiona
lly been addicted to large-scale production to achieve economies
of scale in
 spite of dire predictions about adverse market conditions.
Korea's three le
ading carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - are hoping to
repeat the success
 of the country's shipbuilding, electronics and
petrochemical companies, whi
ch added massive production capacity during the
last five years and are now 
reaping the benefits by quickly filling rising
global demand.
The expansion 
of car production has the support of the government, which
selected the moto
r industry as a vital sector in 1990 and gave it easy
access to state-subsid
ised bank loans and overseas borrowing privileges to
raise capital for the c
apacity increase.
If the expansion goes according to plan, Korea will become
 fourth biggest
car manufacturer in the world by end of the decade, with its
 three main
companies being included among the top ten carmakers.
Hyundai wa
nts to increase its production from 1.16m vehicles this year to
2.3m in the 
year 2000. Production will double to 1.5m at Kia by 1997 and
quandruple to 2
.2m at Daewoo by the end of the decade.
Ssangyong, which produces commerical
 trucks and sports vehicles, also plans
to start car manufacturing in late 1
996 in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz.
Its initial production of 50,000 cars
 is expected to rise to 150,000 by
2000.
'The Koreans are contradicting the 
global trend toward downsizing,' said Don
Lee, motor industry analyst at BZW
 Securities in Seoul. 'They are justifying
the expansion by going into new m
arkets in the developing world.'
Exports now account for only a quarter of K
orean car production, but
manufacturers want to raise the ratio to 40 or 50 
per cent within the next
several years as growth in the domestic market slow
s down to an annual rate
of 10 per cent from 40 per cent in the late 1980s. 
The weakness of the
Korean currency against the strong yen is likely to bene
fit Korea in its
export plans.
Overseas sales in developing countries accoun
ted for 46.2 per cent of
exports during the first half of 1994, while shipme
nts to North America
accounted for 37.4 per cent of exports and western Euro
pe 16.4 per cent.
The car companies are concentrating on increasing their ma
rket share in the
developing world by building local assembly plants to avoi
d possible tariff
barriers. Hyundai has signed joint-venture agreements in I
ndonesia, the
Philippines, Egypt and Zimbabwe to produce a total of 300,000 
cars abroad.
Kia will also produce 300,000 cars overseas through planned fac
ilities in
Indonesia, Mexico, India and Morocco.
Daewoo has set a more ambit
ious target of producing 1m cars in the
developing world to take advantage o
f the region's low wages. Joint ventures
have been established in Uzbekistan
, Iran, India and Vietnam. Daewoo is now
negotiating to build a car parts fa
ctory in China as the first step toward
gaining approval from Beijing for th
e construction of a car factory in what
is potentially its largest overseas 
market.
But the Korean carmakers are not neglecting the US and Europe. While
 Hyundai
already has a strong presence in these markets, its rivals are foll
owing
suit.
Kia began establishing distribution networks in the US and Europ
e last year
and recently signed an agreement with Karmann of Germany to prod
uce its
Sportage four-wheel drive vehicle for the European market from next 
year.
Daewoo has acquired a car plant in Romania to supply vehicles for its

independent West European dealer network, which will begin operations in
199
5. It will also enter the US market in 1996.
But while Korean carmakers are 
aggressively expanding abroad, they must
worry about the opening of their st
rongly protected home market to imports.
The US and the EU are demanding tha
t Korea reduce duties and non-tariff
barriers that limited the sale of forei
gn cars in Korea to slightly less
than 2,000 last year, only 0.19 of the tot
al market.
Seoul recently agreed to cut the car tariff to 8 per cent from 10
 per cent
and ease restrictions on TV advertising and distribution outlets, 
but the
concessions have still not satisfied Washington, which has led the c
ampaign
against the car import restrictions.
Even if further concessions are
 made, sales of US and European cars in Korea
are not likely to represent mu
ch of a threat to domestic manufacturers since
the foreign models will be co
ncentrated in the executive car segment.
A more serious worry would be aboli
tion of the two decade-old ban on car
imports from Japan. It remains undecid
ed whether the Korea will lift the ban
in 1997 as part of a programme to imp
rove trade relations with Japan. But
Tokyo is expected to demand this action
 if Korea wants to gain membership in
the Organisation for Economic Co-opera
tion and Development in 1996.
The irony is that the Korean motor industry ha
s largely developed due to
technical help provided by Japanese car manufactu
rers. Hyundai has a
partnership with Mitsubishi, Kia with Mazda and Ford, an
d Daewoo recently
linked up with Honda after dissolving its joint venture wi
th General Motors.

<HEADLINE> FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of the Philippines (9): Protect
ion for a final frontier - Victor Mallet visits the island of Palawan, an en
vironmental test-case for south-east Asia </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By VICTOR 
MALLET </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGN at the 'Bottleground' bar on Rizal Avenue, 
boasts: 'Hot Women Plus
Cold Beer.'
With its brothels and Roman Catholic chu
rches, there is not much at first
glance to distinguish Puerto Princesa, the
 capital of the island province of
Palawan, from any other town in the Phili
ppines.
A typical family owns an old videotape of the wedding of Britain's P
rince
Charles to Lady Diana Spencer, and has eight children. Seven masses ar
e
celebrated each Sunday at the Immaculate Conception cathedral, to
accommod
ate the growing number of inhabitants.
Religion even penetrates the undergro
und river, Palawan's main tourist
attraction - 'see this stalactite - it is 
like the Virgin Mary,' declares
the boatman to his sceptical passengers. 'An
d this one' - he points at
another apparently shapeless rock - 'is like the 
Holy Family.'
In one very important sense, however, Palawan is different. El
sewhere in the
Philippines almost all the tropical forest has been destroyed
, but about
half of this long, thin mountainous island south-west of Manila 
is still
covered with trees.
Elsewhere, coral reefs have been dynamited into
 oblivion, but in the waters
around Palawan much of the coral and other form
s of marine life have
survived, making the area a paradise for divers and th
e source of two thirds
of the fish for the national capital, Metro Manila.
P
alawan has become a test case, not just for the Philippines but for
south-ea
st Asia as a whole: is it possible to preserve some of the region's
beauty a
nd natural resources for future generations, or must everything be
destroyed
 to make room for an increasing population and for the traffic jams
which ac
company the phenomenon known as 'economic development'?
'Palawan, our last f
rontier: make it last. Stop illegal fishing,' declares
the roadside billboar
d in Puerto Princesa. Another billboard shows the
diminishing size of fish c
aught over the past 20 years, and urges fishermen
to stop using cyanide, whi
ch does not discriminate between baby and mature
fish and therefore needless
ly decimates fish populations.
The presence of the billboards is both bad ne
ws and good news. The bad news
is that the battle to save Palawan's resource
s for the future is an uphill
struggle; the good news is that a few members 
of the central and local
governments are starting to take the matter serious
ly.
The very fact that Palawan is relatively undamaged - and undisturbed by

separatist or communist rebels - makes the island a favoured destination
bot
h for poor migrants from other parts of the Philippines and for foreign
tour
ists. Migrants follow the logging companies' bulldozers to clear
farmland fo
r rice, cashew nuts or coconuts, and the tourists come to find
the tranquill
ity now lost in much of the rest of south-east Asia.
Palawan also has oil of
fshore and nickel deposits in the south, but the
financial benefits - even w
hen they come to the island rather than to the
central government or to big 
business - are clouded by the inevitable
disadvantages.
The island's populat
ion has doubled to about 600,000 in the past decade, and
Puerto Princesa is 
starting to smell of the diesel smoke and motor-cycle
fumes generated by tru
cks and tricycle taxis; one of the nickel companies is
being accused of poll
uting a river with laterite waste; there are fears that
the gold prospectors
, who have recently rushed to the north of the island,
will poison fresh wat
er with the mercury they use to separate their gold
from sand; and there are
 increasing signs that deforestation is causing the
erosion of land, silting
 of rivers, and fresh-water shortages which have
plagued other islands in th
e Philippines.
A moratorium on commercial logging in Palawan was imposed las
t year, and
more recently the authorities banned the transport of live fish 
which had
been exported from the island to aquariums and to Chinese restaura
nts.
Enforcement of environmental regulations, however, is hard - 'it's very

difficult,' says Mr Felipe Ortiz, the chief of forest management at the
Dep
artment of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in Puerto Princesa.
'The
re are many people in the city - and it's still a developing city.
There's r
eally a need for lumber.'
Furthermore, big businessmen backed by private arm
ies are still keen to
export logs in defiance of the official ban. Court cas
es filed against those
who violate timber laws are sometimes mysteriously di
smissed, local
officials say.
But the election of a new mayor and a more enl
ightened local government for
the capital Puerto Princesa in May last year h
as given a boost to Palawan's
environmental campaigners.
'Before, they (the 
old officials) made lots of speeches about conservation,
but meanwhile their
 people were out cutting trees,' says Mr Ortiz.
In 1991, 14 members of Harib
on Palawan, the island's main environmental
group, were charged with subvers
ion and harassment, although the charges
were eventually dropped. Now, Harib
on workers carry walkie-talkies provided
by the local authorities so the two
 sides can work as a team.
The resounding defeat of Mr Ramon Mitra, the form
er speaker of the
Philippine House of Representatives, in last year's presid
ential election,
is also a bonus for the environmentalists, since he was reg
arded as the
political patron of Mr Jose Alvarez, a businessman from outside
 the island
who has taken a leading role in the logging industry in Palawan.

Palawan's new mood of co-operation between the local authorities,
environme
ntalists and inhabitants was underlined at a recent ceremony in the
district
 of Tagabinet attended by Haribon representatives and local
officials.
Twent
y-two members of the Batak and Tagbanua tribes were awarded
'stewardship cer
tificates', giving them the right (under a national plan to
control upland c
ultivation) to occupy and farm their land near the St Paul's
national park. 
Previously they were regarded as illegal settlers. In
exchange they must und
ertake not to expand their clearing by cutting down
forest trees. Mr Mil Rey
noso, the vice-mayor of Puerto Princesa, said too
much deforestation would t
urn the country into a desert like Iraq - 'it
affects the personality of the
 people there,' he said. 'They are so hard.'
It is by no means certain that 
the farmers fully understand their
obligations under the scheme - one drunke
n smallholder immediately asked
whether it was all right if he chopped down 
a protected species of tree
because it was good for building houses - but at
 least a start has been made
in winning the support of the inhabitants of Pa
lawan for efforts to preserve
the island's resources.
Mr Joselito Alisuag, t
he activist lawyer who heads Haribon Palawan, is
relieved that he finally ha
s a few allies in the city hall. 'We used to
fight everyone,' he says as he 
fingers his walkie-talkie. 'Now we've got
friends.'

<HEADLINE> FT  31 JUL 92 / Management: Prepared for the worst - 
Planning for a crisis </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By PAUL TAYLOR </BYLINE>
<TEXT
>
What happens when a briefcase containing company secrets goes missing, a
b
lackmailer laces the company's top-selling food product with poison, or
toxi
c factory waste escapes threatening an environmental disaster?
For most comp
anies a crisis like this will never happen. But when disaster
strikes, the c
onsequences can be so dire, that managers are starting to lay
contingency pl
ans, just in case.
Crisis Planning has only recently emerged as a management
 issue, in response
to the headline-grabbing disasters in the past decade. A
mong those judged to
have been well handled were the lacing of Johnson and J
ohnson's Tylenol
capsules with cyanide in the US, and the British Midland ai
r disaster at
Kegworth in Leicestershire.
In contrast, the Bhopal toxic gas 
disaster involving a Union Carbide plant
in India, and the King's Cross unde
rground fire are often cited as examples
of poor crisis planning and managem
ent.
Few businesses are immune from crisis, but research suggests even fewer
 have
a strategy for dealing with disasters. A recent survey conducted by
Al
exander Stenhouse, the insurance brokers and risk management experts,
found 
that only one in four UK companies had a strategy for dealing with a
product
-tampering crisis and only one in three had developed a plan for
minimising 
the risk resulting from an environmental crisis.
There is an understandable 
reluctance to confront an issue which may never
happen. However, there is ev
idence that the worst time to learn how to
manage a crisis is during a crisi
s itself.
For this reason a number of consultants have begun to sell crisis 
management
services. One such, dubbed Total Crisis Management (TCM), is offe
red by a
group of four firms comprising Alexander Stenhouse, the London law 
firm,
Denton Hall Burgin & Warren, Ogilvy Adams & Rinehart, the public relat
ions
consultants, and Touche Ross, the management consultants.
The four firm
s promise a full crisis planning and management service, which
begins with a
n internal risk review and includes a 24-hour crisis telephone
hot line.
The
 TCM group says a simple problem can become a crisis if the company is
unpre
pared.
Although the TCM partners acknowledge a crisis cannot always be avoid
ed,
they insist the best way to survive is to plan ahead. But they also caut
ion
against rigid responses. 'Simply having a crisis manual may be worse tha
n
useless,' the experts say. 'No-one will have read it. The crisis you are
h
andling won't be in it and you won't have time to wade through it when
insta
nt decisions are needed.'
So how can you prepare for a crisis? The first ste
p is to bring together the
expertise - internally or from outside - to defin
e possible crises and to
explore the risks. Then planning, communications an
d training packages can
be put in place as 'insurance' for the future. There
 are three main stages:
Crisis preparation: Undertake an audit of the releva
nt risks, including
environmental dangers, legal and security threats, and p
olitical or other
external pressures. Then review risk control policies and 
prepare a crisis
manual as a basis for training and simulation exercises. It
 should describe
the authority, the aim and the staffing of a crisis managem
ent team. It
should contain relevant telephone numbers of experts, and make 
clear who is
supposed to be doing what.
Crisis handling: The team must be as
sembled, and the situation assessed
coolly and professionally. Communication
 is the most important item.
Companies must be ready to give and to receive 
information from a wide
variety of sources.
A recent study by Alexander & As
sociates, management consultants, shows that
most companies communicate poor
ly with their regulatory bodies, concentrate
on the shareholder at the expen
se of the customer, and have feeble systems
for internal communication. Comp
anies should ensure all the media's
questions are answered and should liaise
 with investigatory bodies to
protect and minimise exposure to criminal or c
ivil liabilities.
Crisis after-care: When the dust settles, do not relax and
 lose the
initiative. There will be many lessons to learn and opportunities 
to take
after a crisis. The review should begin as soon as the crisis is ove
r. Staff
should be reassured that the point of the review is not to find cul
prits,
but to improve the working of the plan.

<BYLINE>    By ANDREW BAXTER </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBOTS have become an e
stablished part of the vehicle manufacturing scene
over the past 15 years. T
he motor industry accounts for as much as 40 per
cent of the 450,000 install
ed industrial robots worldwide but their use is
changing and applications ar
e expanding.
The traditional picture of long lines of robots each making bil
lions of spot
welds on car bodies in a working life of eight to 10 years is 
still true,
but only half the story. Those same welding robots are as likely
 to be
grouped in flexible manufacturing cells and capable of handling a wid
e range
of models in quick succession.
At the same time, smaller robots are 
increasingly being used in engine
assembly, where their ability to do qualit
y, repetitive work with a
precision of 1/100th of a millimetre is much in de
mand. Robots are being
used in final assembly work and paint spraying, and s
uppliers hope to be
able to develop these markets now that the technology ha
s been proven.
There is an emerging trend for robots to be used in automotiv
e
sub-contracting, prompted by the vehicle manufacturers' need to be as
conf
ident in the consistency and quality of out-sourced components as for
their 
own work.
The shorter lives of car models, prompted by increased competition
 in the
industry and the Japanese producers' early efforts to reduce product

development times, are changing the use and design of robots.
The tradition
al practice of replacing a robot after two model cycles may
have been approp
riate when each car model was lasting six to eight years.
But with model liv
es reduced to three to four years, users want to keep
their robots for furth
er models, and thus want increased flexibility,
according to Dr Axel Gerhard
t, a senior board member at the holding company
for Kuka, Germany's largest 
robot supplier.
Many of the latest trends in the use of robotics originated 
in Japan where
labour shortages have spurred much greater penetration of rob
ots into
industry overall compared with Europe and the US. But robot supplie
rs such
as ABB Robotics, the largest in Europe, believe the European automot
ive
industry is as enthusiastic a user of robotic automation as its Japanese

counterpart.
However, some of the more recent applications of robots are le
ss prevalent
in Europe, giving an opportunity to suppliers if they can convi
nce producers
of the economic benefits. There are national variations too: t
he UK is a
long way behind the US and the rest of Europe in the use of robot
s in the
paint shop, says Mr Mike Wilson, UK sales and marketing director at
 GMFanuc
Robotics.
The versatility of modern industrial robots for tasks tha
t go beyond spot
welding is illustrated by Kuka's involvement in final assem
bly of the
Citroen XM. Following painting, robots dismount the doors and tai
lgate, with
the aid of sensors, for completion on separate trim lines; the c
ockpit is
picked up by robot from an automatic guided vehicle, inserted thro
ugh the
door and then bolted to the body by a second robot.
Robots are used 
for applying the adhesive sealants and for fitting the glass
exactly into th
e body aperture with the aid of ultrasonic scanners; seats
are inserted by r
obot after measuring the exact position of the body by
means of tactile sens
ors, wheels are mounted and doors and tailgate
refitted.
Some of these tasks
 are difficult for robots because of the nature of final
assembly. Robots ar
e having to operate in a less structured environment,
says Mr Wilson, and de
al with less defined objects such as seats.
Another problem, at least outsid
e Japan, is that labour is available and
costs less than in skilled manufact
uring areas. So robot suppliers have to
find applications that create added 
value, says Mr Stelio Demark, head of
ABB Robotics.
There are still opportun
ities for greater use of robots further up the
production line. Relatively n
ew processes such as laser-cutting and
water-jet cutting are likely to becom
e more prevalent, in association with
robots, especially for working with pl
astics and new advanced composites.
Mr Demark sees a substantial increase in
 automated arc-welding in the
automotive industry and sub-suppliers. And Com
au, the Italian robotics and
systems group, expects some interesting investm
ents in the body area,
prompted by the increased need for new models, accord
ing to Mr Massimo
Mattucci, vice-president for engineering and marketing.
In
 paint spraying, says Mr Demark, robots have hardly scratched the surface.
L
ast year, ABB strengthened its position in the robotic painting market with

the acquisition of Graco in the US, but GMFanuc, a US/Japanese concern, and

Behr of Germany have strong positions.
The flexibility of robots to handle m
odel changes will be the key to their
further implementation in the car body
 area. In engine and transmission
production, robots are becoming better est
ablished, and Mr Mattucci suggests
a new generation of engines prompted by t
ougher environmental regulations
could be the spur to further investment in 
robots.
However, an increasing portion of business for robot suppliers seems
 likely
to come from refurbishment of existing robots rather than new purcha
ses as
customers seek maximum value from their manufacturing investments.
In
 the past three or four years, this has been a growing trend of robot
refitt
ing and modification in the motor industry, carried out during model
changeo
vers and restoring robots to previous levels of accuracy and
productivity.

<HEADLINE> FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (1
1): Search for new applications - Robotics, still on the fringe of the indus
trial sector </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By ANDREW BAXTER </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a
ll the hype over the past 20 years about how robots would transform
manufact
uring industry, they still remain on the fringes of the industrial
scene - w
ith the notable exception of manufacturing in Japan.
According to the United
 Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the world
industrial robot populati
on stood at 388,000 units at the end of 1989, of
which 220,000 were in Japan
, 56,000 in western Europe, 37,000 in the US and
 -very roughly - 75,000 els
ewhere.
There are a number of interconnected reasons for this situation. In 
the
past, there has been considerable hostility from trade unions to their
i
ntroduction and managements have taken a lot of convincing about the cost
be
nefits.
Dr Kevin Clarke, manager of manufacturing engineering at PA Consulti
ng
Group, says that, in many instances, robots have not delivered the cost
e
ffectiveness they have promised. Robot manufacturers, he says, have not
deve
loped their products technologically as fast as they might have.
'There's ve
ry little innovation, because the market isn't there,' he says.
However, the
 evidence of the past two years suggests that things may be
changing. Those 
388,000 units represented an increase of 20 per cent from
the end of 1988, a
nd in 1990 US-based robotics companies won record new
orders of Dollars 517.
4m.
The robotics industry was in deep gloom during 1986 and 1987, and especi
ally
in the US where it had become far too dependent on the motor industry -

which took about 40 to 50 per cent of sales.
Mr Donald Vincent, executive v
ice-president of the US Robotic Industries
Association, recalls that 'when t
he automotive industry quit buying in 1986
and 1987, it sent robotics into a
 deep spin.'
This decline had two results. First, it encouraged a much-neede
d
concentration among robot producers. In the middle of the 1980s there were

some 300, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). Now,

it says, there are probably fewer than 100 true producers, led by ABB
Robot
ics, part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, GMF Robotics, a joint
vent
ure between Fanuc of Japan and General Motors of the US, and Yaskawa of
Japa
n.
Secondly, the downturn prompted an urgent search for new applications for

robots away from the motor industry and its inherent cyclicality. Dr Clarke

singles out 'clean room' applications for robots in health care and
precisi
on engineering, while Mr Vincent is hopeful of new applications in
the food 
industry, materials handling and packaging.
The wellspring for this diversif
ication into new markets, which has already
begun, is computer power. In mec
hanical terms, robots are relatively simple
beasts, and robotic technology h
as always been based on the use of computers
to overcome mechanical limitati
ons.
Mr Kenneth Waldron, a robotics expert at Ohio State University, says 't
he
major theme which will direct commercial applications of new research in

robotics will be that of taking advantage of the huge increases in computing

power which have become available as a result of the development of advance
d
microprocessors.'
Mr Waldron notes that most current industrial robot syst
ems offer only
incremental improvements over what was possible with the firs
t generation of
microcomputer controllers.
Current research is looking at ar
eas such as greater use of sensing - of the
robot's environment and internal
 state - more sophisticated control
techniques offering greater speed and ac
curacy, robotic mobility and
improved control of the interface between the r
obot and the workpiece.
Given these trends, there has inevitably been consid
erable interest in
industrial vision systems for robots, which could radical
ly change many
applications, particularly in assembly where robots have so f
ar failed to
make their mark.
Previous forecasts for the population of visio
n-equipped robots have not
been realised, but it is reasonable to predict, a
s the IFR has, that the
continuous reduction in prices of computers and sens
ors, and their greater
speed and reliability, will gradually remove the tech
nological and economic
barriers.
Many of the business trends in robotics ove
r the past few years are
illustrated by developments at ABB Robotics, which 
claims to be the world's
biggest supplier - a title which the Japanese manuf
acturers might dispute.
ABB's purchase last year of Cincinnati Milacron's ro
botics business was an
important step in the consolidation of the industry a
round leading European
and Japanese suppliers. Mr Stelio Demark, head of ABB
 Robotics, says the
Cincinnati business brought with it a tremendous US cust
omer base and
undoubted expertise in spot-welding robotics.
The nature of AB
B's customer base has also been changing, and over the past
five years it ha
s reduced its dependence on the automotive industry from
70-75 per cent of s
ales to 50 per cent. ABB is attracting new business from
small and medium-si
zed companies which had previously not bought robots. 'We
may be supplying o
nes and twos, but it's growing very quickly,' says Mr
Demark.
New markets in
clude glass making, different kinds of process applications,
and palletising
. This effort is backed up by spending on research and
development - 10 per 
cent of revenues - that is almost on a par with that of
the pharmaceutical i
ndustry.
Meanwhile the falling cost of electronics is allowing ABB to build 
more
capability and flexibility into its robots. ABB's latest product, the I
RB
6000, was officially launched last month with claims of much greater
flex
ibility and capability than rival products.
Because of these developments, M
r Demark is optimistic about future growth
prospects for ABB and the industr
y. The view is shared by independent
observers.
In a report about to be publ
ished by Frost & Sullivan, the international
market research publishers, tot
al world robot sales are forecast to rise
from Dollars 2.15bn in 1990 to Dol
lars 3.41bn in 1996. The relatively small
size of the industry at the end of
 the 1980s is a reflection of many of the
factors mentioned above.
F & S see
s the Japanese market's share of world robot sales falling from 65
per cent 
last year to 45 per cent in 1996, while Europe's share will rise
from 15 to 
20 per cent, the US will mark time at about 6 per cent and the
rest of the w
orld will jump from 14 per cent to just under 30 per cent.
The biggest growt

<HEADLINE> FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (1
1): Search for new applications - Robotics, still on the fringe of the indus
trial sector </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By ANDREW BAXTER </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a
ll the hype over the past 20 years about how robots would transform
manufact
uring industry, they still remain on the fringes of the industrial
scene - w
ith the notable exception of manufacturing in Japan.
According to the United
 Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the world
industrial robot populati
on stood at 388,000 units at the end of 1989, of
which 220,000 were in Japan
, 56,000 in western Europe, 37,000 in the US and
 -very roughly - 75,000 els
ewhere.
There are a number of interconnected reasons for this situation. In 
the
past, there has been considerable hostility from trade unions to their
i
ntroduction and managements have taken a lot of convincing about the cost
be
nefits.
Dr Kevin Clarke, manager of manufacturing engineering at PA Consulti
ng
Group, says that, in many instances, robots have not delivered the cost
e
ffectiveness they have promised. Robot manufacturers, he says, have not
deve
loped their products technologically as fast as they might have.
'There's ve
ry little innovation, because the market isn't there,' he says.
However, the
 evidence of the past two years suggests that things may be
changing. Those 
388,000 units represented an increase of 20 per cent from
the end of 1988, a
nd in 1990 US-based robotics companies won record new
orders of Dollars 517.
4m.
The robotics industry was in deep gloom during 1986 and 1987, and especi
ally
in the US where it had become far too dependent on the motor industry -

which took about 40 to 50 per cent of sales.
Mr Donald Vincent, executive v
ice-president of the US Robotic Industries
Association, recalls that 'when t
he automotive industry quit buying in 1986
and 1987, it sent robotics into a
 deep spin.'
This decline had two results. First, it encouraged a much-neede
d
concentration among robot producers. In the middle of the 1980s there were

some 300, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). Now,

it says, there are probably fewer than 100 true producers, led by ABB
Robot
ics, part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, GMF Robotics, a joint
vent
ure between Fanuc of Japan and General Motors of the US, and Yaskawa of
Japa
n.
Secondly, the downturn prompted an urgent search for new applications for

robots away from the motor industry and its inherent cyclicality. Dr Clarke

singles out 'clean room' applications for robots in health care and
precisi
on engineering, while Mr Vincent is hopeful of new applications in
the food 
industry, materials handling and packaging.
The wellspring for this diversif
ication into new markets, which has already
begun, is computer power. In mec
hanical terms, robots are relatively simple
beasts, and robotic technology h
as always been based on the use of computers
to overcome mechanical limitati
ons.
Mr Kenneth Waldron, a robotics expert at Ohio State University, says 't
he
major theme which will direct commercial applications of new research in

robotics will be that of taking advantage of the huge increases in computing

power which have become available as a result of the development of advance
d
microprocessors.'
Mr Waldron notes that most current industrial robot syst
ems offer only
incremental improvements over what was possible with the firs
t generation of
microcomputer controllers.
Current research is looking at ar
eas such as greater use of sensing - of the
robot's environment and internal
 state - more sophisticated control
techniques offering greater speed and ac
curacy, robotic mobility and
improved control of the interface between the r
obot and the workpiece.
Given these trends, there has inevitably been consid
erable interest in
industrial vision systems for robots, which could radical
ly change many
applications, particularly in assembly where robots have so f
ar failed to
make their mark.
Previous forecasts for the population of visio
n-equipped robots have not
been realised, but it is reasonable to predict, a
s the IFR has, that the
continuous reduction in prices of computers and sens
ors, and their greater
speed and reliability, will gradually remove the tech
nological and economic
barriers.
Many of the business trends in robotics ove
r the past few years are
illustrated by developments at ABB Robotics, which 
claims to be the world's
biggest supplier - a title which the Japanese manuf
acturers might dispute.
ABB's purchase last year of Cincinnati Milacron's ro
botics business was an
important step in the consolidation of the industry a
round leading European
and Japanese suppliers. Mr Stelio Demark, head of ABB
 Robotics, says the
Cincinnati business brought with it a tremendous US cust
omer base and
undoubted expertise in spot-welding robotics.
The nature of AB
B's customer base has also been changing, and over the past
five years it ha
s reduced its dependence on the automotive industry from
70-75 per cent of s
ales to 50 per cent. ABB is attracting new business from
small and medium-si
zed companies which had previously not bought robots. 'We
may be supplying o
nes and twos, but it's growing very quickly,' says Mr
Demark.
New markets in
clude glass making, different kinds of process applications,
and palletising
. This effort is backed up by spending on research and
development - 10 per 
cent of revenues - that is almost on a par with that of
the pharmaceutical i
ndustry.
Meanwhile the falling cost of electronics is allowing ABB to build 
more
capability and flexibility into its robots. ABB's latest product, the I
RB
6000, was officially launched last month with claims of much greater
flex
ibility and capability than rival products.
Because of these developments, M
r Demark is optimistic about future growth
prospects for ABB and the industr
y. The view is shared by independent
observers.
In a report about to be publ
ished by Frost & Sullivan, the international
market research publishers, tot
al world robot sales are forecast to rise
from Dollars 2.15bn in 1990 to Dol
lars 3.41bn in 1996. The relatively small
size of the industry at the end of
 the 1980s is a reflection of many of the
factors mentioned above.
F & S see
s the Japanese market's share of world robot sales falling from 65
per cent 
last year to 45 per cent in 1996, while Europe's share will rise
from 15 to 
20 per cent, the US will mark time at about 6 per cent and the
rest of the w
orld will jump from 14 per cent to just under 30 per cent.
The biggest growt
h area is Asia, which is good news for the Japanese
producers, but Europe, s
ays Mr Demark, is also 'very interesting,' and the
company's home base. F & 
S sees the European market rising from Dollars 330m
in 1990 to Dollars 687m 
in 1996, with Germany leading the way.
Looking specifically at the European 
market, F & S comments that the
'supplier capable of marketing a complete pa
ckage including sensors,
user-friendly software and simple training and inst
allation will achieve the

<TEXT>
In the US f
ashion industry they call it 'localised abrasion' - the pre-worn
look for de
nim jeans produced by applying potassium permanganate solution to
the knee, 
thigh and seat areas.
The faded effect has traditionally been achieved throu
gh manual spraying,
but consistency and quality control have been hard to ac
hieve. Now GMFanuc
Robotics has perfected a robotic solution that is three t
imes faster than
manual spraying, can reproduce a spray pattern to an accura
cy of 0.03 inch,
and can be programmed easily to handle a wide range of garm
ents.
The system is a relatively simple example of recent trends in the indu
strial
robotics industry, which is trying to reduce its dependence on compar
atively
mature automotive markets and find new applications elsewhere.
It is
 a trend that is particularly important for robot suppliers in the
European 
market, where the overall penetration of robots into industry is
much lower 
than in Japan, and where a potentially huge market for
non-automotive applic
ations remains untapped.
According to Massimo Mattucci, vice president for e
ngineering and marketing
at Comau of Italy, around 50 per cent of industrial
 robots installed in
Europe are in use in the automotive industry and 20 per
 cent in electronics
 -the reverse of the situation in Japan.
'The automotiv
e industry has more or less understood the potential of
robots,' says Stelio
 Demark, head of ABB Robotics, Europe's largest
producer, although he stress
es, along with other robot industry executives,
the potential of robots in t
he paint-spraying and final assembly area of
European vehicle manufacturing.

The inherent flexibility of modern robots, and the advances made in control

systems and mechanics that have increased their speed and reliability, ough
t
to increase their suitability for small-batch manufacturing in Europe, whe
re
model changes are frequent.
Demark sees new opportunities for robots emer
ging in the European food,
packaging, pharmaceutical and white goods industr
ies.
But the pace at which European industry accepts robots will depend part
ly on
suppliers' ability to counter the mistrust caused by the hype of the 1
970s
and early 1980s, when the robot industry appeared to be carried away by

euphoria over business prospects.
There are other obstacles, too, for suppl
iers to surmount. In Japan, one of
the driving forces behind the growth in t
he industrial robot population to
274,210 in 1990 - nearly 10 times the popu
lation in the former West Germany
 -has been labour shortages.
'Everything h
as to come back to economic considerations,' says Axel
Gerhardt, an executiv
e board member of IWKA, the holding company for Kuka,
Germany's largest robo
t supplier. 'In Europe robots are used where it is
economical to do so. In J
apan the question is often whether to produce with
a robot or not to produce
 there at all.'
Mistakes have also been made in the installation of robots, 
for which the
suppliers and customers have to share the blame. 'People have 
tended to put
in a robot, then have an operator standing by watching,' says 
Demark. 'This
is a half-way house that I wouldn't recommend.'
Increasingly, 
robot suppliers are realising that if they are to make inroads
into the smal
l- and medium-sized businesses that still dominate European
industry - espec
ially outside the automotive sector  - they have to
understand better the cu
stomer's needs and worries.
'You have to enter into an economic calculation 
with the customer and
demonstrate the ability to find a solution,' says Matt
ucci.
That could mean being paid only for a feasibility study that comes dow
n
against the use of robots. But in the long run this approach makes more
se
nse for an industry that wants to broaden its customer base and maintain
its
 reputation.
Comau, which sells most of its robots as part of an integrated 
automation
package, is around 90 per cent dependent on the vehicle industry.
 Mattucci
wants to expand the remaining 10 per cent of the business to 30 pe
r cent
over the next five years by exploiting the group's strengths in robot
ics for
body-welding, mechanical assembly and difficult handling operations.

The Italian company's most ambitious step away from the automotive sector i
s
its involvement in the Columbus Automation and robotics Testbed (Cat)
prog
ramme financed by the European Space Agency. The ground testbed for the
auto
mation and robotics on board the projected Columbus Space Station will
incor
porate a new Comau robot using advanced materials such as aeronautical
alloy
s and composites.
A more-down-to earth approach to broadening the customer b
ase is in evidence
at GMFanuc, the US/Japanese concern which is the world's 
second biggest
supplier. The jean-spraying robot, developed in the US and no
w available in
the UK, offers a high return on investment with a payback of 
less than a
year, says Mike Wilson, the UK sales and marketing manager.
Robo
tics are also in their infancy in the European food industry, partly
because
 it has hitherto been difficult to turn a hose on to a robot to clean
it wit
hout ruining its electrical circuits. In January, GMFanuc launched its
'Wash
down' robot to conform to the strict hygiene requirements of the food
indust
ry and withstand all the chemical substances likely to be used in
washdown o
r wipedown procedures.
In the European electronics industry, robots are more
 frequent but
applications are still developing. Data Packaging, an Irish su
pplier of
plastic moulded components for the computer industry, recently ins
talled an
ABB Robotics painting cell to handle metallic paints used to provi
de an
attractive finish, and assist in electrical shielding, on parts for th
e
Apple Macintosh.
Metallic paints are hard to handle because they block sup
ply lines if not
kept flowing continuously. The ABB system programs the robo
t to fire the
spray gun if the system lays dormant for a given length of tim
e.
Advances such as these are often based on techniques originally developed

for the automotive industry, which is not being neglected in suppliers'
has
te to exploit other markets. A number of fairly recent technologies have
rel
evance to the use of robots in automotive and non-automotive fields.
Laser w
elding, says Wilson, is attracting interest in a number of
industries, inclu
ding aerospace, because of its precision and speed. Unlike
conventional spot
 welding, the robot does not have to reach both sides of
the part to be weld
ed.
Another emerging technology, especially when combined with robotics, is

water-jet cutting, which is likely to become increasingly important for
cutt
ing plastics quickly and cleanly. It is already being used in the
automotive
 industry for cutting carpets, door panels and instrument panels.
In both ar
eas robot suppliers are forming partnerships with companies which
have devel
oped the technologies so that they can exploit the opportunities
quicker. Co
mau has a co-operation agreement with Trumpf, the German machine
tool builde
r best-known for its laser-cutting machines, while last year ABB
Robotics fo
rmed a joint venture with Ingersoll-Rand of the US to develop and
market a r
obotised water-jet cutting system in Europe.
The search for a broader Europe
an customer base coincides with a much more
price-conscious attitude over th
e past two to three years among customers,
due as much to general business c
onditions as to scepticism about the early
claims made by robot suppliers.
S
uppliers are rationalising their product ranges to give customers what they

want and no more, but using developments in control systems to increase the

applications available from each model.
These conditions give advantages and
 disadvantages in more or less equal
measure to European suppliers and Japan
ese/US importers, which control one
third of the market. Demark and Mattucci
 strongly believe that the European
suppliers benefit from a approach based 
on solutions rather than products.
'The Japanese do not have the solutions f
or European needs,' says Mattucci
flatly. This is a view strongly disputed b
y the Japanese producers, but in a
price-sensitive market the the Japanese d
o have the advantage of size -
investment in control systems, in particular,
 can be spread over a bigger
sales base.
Ultimately, though, all the robot s
uppliers could benefit if they can
persuade more European companies of the b
enefits of robots. And that is
likely to be a gradual process where technolo
gy is only one factor in the
equation.

wants to expand the remaining 10 per cent of the business to 30 pe
r cent
over the next five years by exploiting the group's strengths in robot
ics for
body-welding, mechanical assembly and difficult handling operations.

The Italian company's most ambitious step away from the automotive sector i
s
its involvement in the Columbus Automation and robotics Testbed (Cat)
prog
ramme financed by the European Space Agency. The ground testbed for the
auto
mation and robotics on board the projected Columbus Space Station will
incor
porate a new Comau robot using advanced materials such as aeronautical
alloy
s and composites.
A more-down-to earth approach to broadening the customer b
ase is in evidence
at GMFanuc, the US/Japanese concern which is the world's 
second biggest
supplier. The jean-spraying robot, developed in the US and no
w available in
the UK, offers a high return on investment with a payback of 
less than a
year, says Mike Wilson, the UK sales and marketing manager.
Robo
tics are also in their infancy in the European food industry, partly
because
 it has hitherto been difficult to turn a hose on to a robot to clean
it wit
hout ruining its electrical circuits. In January, GMFanuc launched its
'Wash
down' robot to conform to the strict hygiene requirements of the food
indust
ry and withstand all the chemical substances likely to be used in
washdown o
r wipedown procedures.
In the European electronics industry, robots are more
 frequent but
applications are still developing. Data Packaging, an Irish su
pplier of
plastic moulded components for the computer industry, recently ins
talled an
ABB Robotics painting cell to handle metallic paints used to provi
de an
attractive finish, and assist in electrical shielding, on parts for th
e
Apple Macintosh.
Metallic paints are hard to handle because they block sup
ply lines if not
kept flowing continuously. The ABB system programs the robo
t to fire the
spray gun if the system lays dormant for a given length of tim
e.
Advances such as these are often based on techniques originally developed

for the automotive industry, which is not being neglected in suppliers'
has
te to exploit other markets. A number of fairly recent technologies have
rel
evance to the use of robots in automotive and non-automotive fields.
Laser w
elding, says Wilson, is attracting interest in a number of
industries, inclu
ding aerospace, because of its precision and speed. Unlike
conventional spot
 welding, the robot does not have to reach both sides of
the part to be weld
ed.
Another emerging technology, especially when combined with robotics, is

water-jet cutting, which is likely to become increasingly important for
cutt
ing plastics quickly and cleanly. It is already being used in the
automotive
 industry for cutting carpets, door panels and instrument panels.
In both ar
eas robot suppliers are forming partnerships with companies which
have devel
oped the technologies so that they can exploit the opportunities
quicker. Co
mau has a co-operation agreement with Trumpf, the German machine
tool builde
r best-known for its laser-cutting machines, while last year ABB
Robotics fo
rmed a joint venture with Ingersoll-Rand of the US to develop and
market a r
obotised water-jet cutting system in Europe.
The search for a broader Europe
an customer base coincides with a much more
price-conscious attitude over th
e past two to three years among customers,
due as much to general business c
onditions as to scepticism about the early
claims made by robot suppliers.
S
uppliers are rationalising their product ranges to give customers what they

want and no more, but using developments in control systems to increase the

applications available from each model.
These conditions give advantages and
 disadvantages in more or less equal
measure to European suppliers and Japan
ese/US importers, which control one
third of the market. Demark and Mattucci
 strongly believe that the European
suppliers benefit from a approach based 
on solutions rather than products.
'The Japanese do not have the solutions f
or European needs,' says Mattucci
flatly. This is a view strongly disputed b
y the Japanese producers, but in a
price-sensitive market the the Japanese d
o have the advantage of size -
investment in control systems, in particular,
 can be spread over a bigger
sales base.
Ultimately, though, all the robot s
uppliers could benefit if they can
persuade more European companies of the b
enefits of robots. And that is
likely to be a gradual process where technolo
gy is only one factor in the
equation.

A PLATOON of raw recruits drafted in to the French a
rmy to pack combat
rations are having to look lively. Up to 10 different men
us are needed each
month.
Each ration consists of 18 items ranging from a pa
ck of biscuits and a tin
of meat to purification tablets and a miniature sto
ve. In order to keep the
fighting troops fed, the new recruits have to pack 
rations at the rate of 24
a minute.
The luckless legionnaires are 13 industr
ial robots, part of a FFr25m
automated packaging and palletising line built 
for the army by ABB Robotics.
Three robots unload boxes of goodies from pall
ets on to a conveyor which
delivers them to the ration packing station.
Here
 another nine machines, using videos cameras to recognise the right
items, p
ack them into ration boxes in just 2.5 seconds. The 13 robots stack
the rati
on boxes on to a pallet for delivery to the barracks. Five different
menus c
an be put on one pallet to match a barracks' order.
David Marshall, responsi
ble for customer training at ABB Robotics in Milton
Keynes, fervently hopes 
that the food, drinks and confectionery industry -
including even army ratio
ns - will become the next big market for robots.
'The whole robot industry h
as depended on the automotive industry since day
one. Look at the figures - 
80 per cent of the world market for robots is in
the automotive and automoti
ve supply industry. We are looking to the food
industry to perform as well a
s the automotive industry.'
The reason for his optimism is that industrial r
obots have become more
attractive to the food industry for packing and handl
ing, particularly in
the light of new health and safety regulations restrict
ing the weight of
loads that can be lifted manually.
They have become faster
, reliable, more accurate, and easier to incorporate
into a production line.
 Better motor control software has allowed ABB, for
example, to squeeze 25 p
er cent more performance out of the same robot.
Robots are also simpler to p
rogram, operate and maintain. And they can lift
bigger loads. They can also 
be washed down with a hosepipe. And prices are
coming down to a level where 
paybacks are acceptable to the food industry.
'The food, drink and confectio
nery industry is surviving on low-cost female
labour. Despite their flexibil
ity, using people to pack those army rations
would have been a nightmare,' s
ays Marshall. Also, the industry is looking
to cut costs. Although robots ar
e flexible and reliable, so far they have
been too slow and too expensive, s
ays Marshall.
But what is good for the food and drinks makers is good for ma
nufacturing
industry. Mike Wilson, marketing manager at Fanuc Robotics in Co
ventry, says
of the improvements in robot performance: 'Our new ARC Mate wel
ding robot,
for example, is 30 per cent cheaper in real terms than a similar
 model three
years ago. And it is 20 per cent faster. A spot welding robot c
an now do one
spot weld every 1.5 seconds.' Ten years ago, says Wilson, it w
ould have
taken three.
Some of the gain has come from the improved mechanica
l performance of robots
 -faster acceleration and deceleration and better ov
ershoot behaviour. And
some has come from better integration of the robot in
to the process, says
Wilson. 'The spot welding gun will begin to close befor
e it gets to the
weld, for instance.' The load capacity and accuracy of robo
ts has come on in
leaps and bounds, too. 'The biggest robot we do carries 30
0kg. That was
unheard of 10 years ago for an electric robot,' says Wilson.
R
eliability has also greatly improved, he says. An example is the arc
welding
 robot. Weld wires occasionally get stuck in the solidified weld pool
at the
 end of a weld. A few years ago, as the robot moved away it would rip
the we
lding torch off the arm. Today, says Wilson, 'wire-stick' sensors
prevent th
is and automatically send a pulse of current down the wire to burn
it free.

A similar example of improved capability is 'scratch start'. If a bead of
si
lica from the flux gets left on the end of the welding wire, it will not
str
ike an arc and has to be snipped off manually. Today's robot will sense
this
 and scratch the tip of the wire along the component to rub the bead
off. It
 will then go back to the correct place on the weld and start
welding.
Overa
ll, says Wilson, the cost-to-performance ratio of robots today is
considerab
ly better than a few years ago. Most people now buy a robot
'package' which 
includes some process engineering expertise and an
application software pack
age. 'This avoids a lot of programming and makes
them quicker to install and
 easier to operate.'
When Vauxhall bought 120 Fanuc welding robots for its n
ew Astra line at the
Ellesmere Port plant a couple of years ago, it handed t
hem on to six
companies building the welding lines. 'We designed a software 
package for
Vauxhall that would interface the robots with all the hardware a
nd provide
an operator interface. That forced all the line builders to use t
he robots
in the same way. It made maintenance a lot simpler and saved money
. We only
had to write the software once and copy it six times. Each line bu
ilder
would have had to develop their own.'
Yet despite the advances in robo
t technology, Britain has one of the
smallest robot populations of all the i
ndustrialised nations, around 7,600,
compared with Germany's 39,000 and Japa
n's staggering 350,000.
Even the former USSR has more robots per employee in
 manufacturing industry
than Britain. The problem is the 18 month to two yea
r paybacks demanded in
Britain, says Wilson, compared with as long as five y
ears in Japan. 'It is
very difficult to justify any capital expenditure on a
n 18 month payback.'

<HEADLINE> FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology: Robot lifts the load </HEA

<BYLINE>    BY MAX GLASKIN </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A robot fork lift truck t
hat carries loads between lorry trailer and factory
floor could extend autom
ation to the loading bay. A prototype now being
tested maps its surroundings
 continuously and plots its routes.
'There is no system in the world that lo
ads and unloads conventional
trailers fully autonomously,' says Malcolm Robe
rts, director of Guidance
Control Systems of the UK. 'We built a system four
 years ago that relied on
mirrors in the trailers to reflect positioning las
ers but now we don't need
them.'
Drivers of trailers up to 16m long cannot p
ark them accurately enough for a
fixed robot loader to work. The GCS robot c
opes with such variables and also
detects changes in its surroundings - for 
instance, when a pallet is in its
path. A central computer communicates the 
tasks by radio to the robot, which
is otherwise autonomous.
The robot uses a
 variety of sensors to detect its own location and the
trailer. A laser syst
em scans ahead up to 25m; for local positioning,
ultrasound is accurate for 
between 20cm and 2m. The ultrasound data is
interpreted quickly by an off-th
e-shelf transputer but an infra-red sensor
cuts in when data of a higher res
olution is needed - to cope with an
odd-shaped load, for example.
The robot 
analyses when it has nudged up close to a load using a force
sensor and torq
ue measurement on each wheel. More sensors control the
sideways movement of 
the forks so that loads are deposited hard up against
the trailer wall.
'A f
ork-lift truck driver can unload a trailer in half an hour with relative
eas
e and our prototype hasn't yet shown it can work so quickly. We expect to
be
 there later this year,' says Roberts.
However, time is not the only cost fa
ctor as robots are not so prone to
accidental damage to loads.

<HEADLINE> FT  21 NOV 94 / Call to put nuclear waste on tips </HE
ADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By MICHAEL SMITH </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should 
force local authorities to accept low-level
radioactive waste on council rub
bish tips, says an influential advisory
body.
The Radioactive Waste Manageme
nt Advisory Committee says in a submission to
the government's review of rad
ioactive waste that it is highly
unsatisfactory that waste producers are for
ced to use Drigg, a repository at
Sellafield in Cumbria, because they are be
ing turned away by councils.
The committee says that Drigg is a national ass
et. Some of its capacity is
being filled by material that is 'suitable to go
 elsewhere'.
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which published ex
tracts of the
committee's submission yesterday, said it was unacceptable tha
t an unelected
body wanted to ignore the safety fears of elected councils.
M
s Bridget Woodman of Greenpeace said: 'Even the smallest doses of radiation

can be fatal. Low-level nuclear waste can remain radioactive for thousands
o
f years, posing a threat to both ourselves and future generations.'
Under th
e 1990 Environmental Protection Act local authorities must be
'persuaded' ra
ther than directed to make landfill sites available for
low-level radioactiv
e waste. This reversed previous legislation which gave
the government enforc
ement powers.
The committee says there is little incentive for local authori
ties to be
persuaded to take radioactive waste because of opposition from pr
essure
groups and public fears.
The committee says: 'It is obviously unsatis
factory from the waste
producer's point of view to be pressurised to use Dri
gg, and therefore incur
higher costs, because suitable landfill facilities a
re not available
locally.
'The government need to ensure . . . landfill site
s are available for
appropriate low-level waste.'
It adds that the governmen
t should adopt powers to enable it to direct
councils and private landfill o
perators to accept 'appropriate' low-level
radioactive waste on refuse tips 
and landfill sites.
The Department of the Environment said the committee's s
ubmission was one of
many which would be considered.

<TEXT>
As plans for 
an underground radioactive waste repository are drawn up in
Britain, enginee
rs in Sweden are preparing to build on the early success of
a similar projec
t.
Caverns have been created under the Baltic Sea at a capital cost of Pound
s
70m to provide a final resting place for much of the radioactive waste fro
m
the country's 12 nuclear power reactors.
The material going into the caver
ns off Forsmark, on Sweden's east coast,
about 80 miles north of Stockholm, 
consists of waste which will be
dangerously radioactive for the relatively s
hort term, several hundreds of
years.
Most of it is low-level waste, such as
 contaminated overalls and gloves but
some is intermediate-level waste, incl
uding sludges and resins.
SKB, the Swedish radioactive waste disposal compan
y, is planning to build a
much deeper repository for long-lived intermediate
-level and high-level
wastes which may remain dangerously radioactive for mi
llions of years.
A short list of sites is expected to be announced next year
 and the facility
could be ready for use by the year 2020.
IS Nirex, SKB's e
quivalent in Britain, is currently boring into the rock
structures at Sellaf
ield, in Cumbria, and Dounreay, in Scotland, to check
the geology before the
 announcement of a preferred site for its own deep
repository. However, it w
ill cater only for low and intermediate-level
wastes.
Under present proposal
s, all high-level waste will continue to be stored on
the surface at Sellafi
eld, where spent nuclear fuel is re-processed by
British Nuclear Fuels.
Near
by, in the village of Drigg, is British Nuclear Fuels' low-level waste
repos
itory, expected to be full by the middle of next century.
Sellafield is like
ly to be the preferred choice for Britain's deep
repository, although no for
mal announcement is due before October.
The Nirex idea is to sink a vertical
 shaft about 700 metres deep and create
a series of caverns running from its
 base and capable of holding 1.4m cubic
metres of waste.
It will cost an est
imated Pounds 800m to build and a further Pounds 1.6bn to
operate over 50 ye
ars.
In 1994 the UK Government is due to carry out a review of nuclear power

economics following its decision two years ago not to finance further
stati
ons after Sizewell B, in Suffolk.
Whether or not nuclear power is allowed to
 expand, a large amount of
radioactive waste has already been created. Much 
more will arise before the
existing stations reach the end of their lifetime
s and are dismantled.
A public inquiry into the Nirex plan for a deep reposi
tory is expected to
start in 1993 and last for a year.
In the meantime, the 
company will continue its efforts to try to convince
the public that undergr
ound waste disposal is practical and safe.
Councillors from both Dounreay an
d Cumbria have been taken to Sweden to
inspect the Forsmark repository, whic
h is close to three nuclear power
reactors.
The repository is approached by 
two tunnels, each one kilometre long, which
slope down through bedrock about
 50 metres beneath the sea.
The waste from the rest of Sweden's nuclear plan
ts, all located on the
coast, is brought to Forsmark by ship. All waste arri
ving at the facility is
already packaged in concrete or steel. It is placed 
in concrete vaults which
are surrounded by bentonite clay.
In its first thre
e years of operation, the repository has accumulated about
6,000 cubic metre
s of waste, one-tenth of its present capacity.
When it was opened it was tho
ught that additional cavern space would have to
be created in order to cater
 for future operating waste.
However, engineers now believe the existing spa
ce will suffice, largely
because of new compaction techniques being used at 
the power stations before
despatch of the waste to Forsmark.
New caverns and
 an additional silo will be necessary to cope with the low
and intermediate-
level waste from the dismantling of the reactors at the end
of their operati
ng lifetimes.
SKB, which is owned by the four Swedish nuclear power utilitie
s, estimates
it will cost Pounds 5bn to de-commission the country's nuclear 
power
stations and dispose of the radioactive waste involved. Operational an
d
de-commissioning waste is expected to total about 230,000 cubic metres.
Th
e Swedish parliament decided after a national referendum in 1980 to
phase-ou
t nuclear power by the year 2010. Three years ago it said plants
would begin
 shutting down in 1995.
However, the start of the phase-out has now been pos
tponed because of the
difficulty in finding acceptable replacement sources o
f electricity.
Coal and oil have been ruled out because of the problems of g
lobal warming
and acid rain, while further hydro schemes have also run into 
environmental
opposition.

Worldwide plans for the underground storage of i
ntermediate and high-level
radioactive waste are:
UK
Some 27 per cent of the
 UK's electricity was produced by 35 reactors last
year. A site in Cumbria c
lose to Sellafield has been identified for an
underground repository for mos
tly intermediate-level waste over 50 years.
The repository is expected to be
 ready in 2010.
FRANCE
Some 78 per cent of electricity was produced by 58 re
actors last year. Two
sites are expected to be short-listed next year for an
 underground
repository for long-lived waste.
GERMANY
Some 34 per cent of el
ectricity is produced by 19 nuclear plants. Two sites
are being considered f
or repositories - a former iron ore mine at Konrad and
a site at Gorleben, b
oth in Lower Saxony. An abandoned salt mine at
Bartensleben in the former ea
st German republic has been used since 1981 for
low and intermediate-level w
aste.
SWEDEN
In 1980 it was decided all nuclear power stations - which curre
ntly produce
about half of the country's electricity - would be to phased ou
t by 2010.
The exact timetable is still to be established. Low and intermedi
ate-level
waste is stored underground near the Forsmark nuclear plant, 50 me
tres below
the bed of the Baltic Sea. Investigations are continuing to ident
ify a site
for high-level waste.
BELGIUM
Nuclear power produces 59 per cent 
of electricity. A potential site for the
disposal of high-level and long-liv
ed radioactive waste was identified in
1974 at Mol-Dessel in northern Belgiu
m, where an underground laboratory has
been working on feasibility studies s
ince 1983.
FINLAND
Nuclear power stations produce 29 per cent of electricity
. The country
already has a repository for low and intermediate level waste 
at Olkiluoto.
The search continues for a site for high-level waste.
US
Some 
20 per cent of power is produced by 110 reactors. A site has been
identified
 under Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for a deep-level repository. An
underground l
aboratory is being constructed.
JAPAN
Some 31 per cent of electricity was pr
oduced by 48 nuclear plants last year.
The Power Reactor Fuel Development Co
rporation plans an underground
laboratory at Honrobe, on the island of Hokka
ido, to study disposal of
high-level waste in sedimentary rock.

<TEXT>
Worldwide plans for the underground storage of i
ntermediate and high-level
radioactive waste are:
UK
Some 27 per cent of the
 UK's electricity was produced by 35 reactors last
year. A site in Cumbria c
lose to Sellafield has been identified for an
underground repository for mos
tly intermediate-level waste over 50 years.
The repository is expected to be
 ready in 2010.
FRANCE
Some 78 per cent of electricity was produced by 58 re
actors last year. Two
sites are expected to be short-listed next year for an
 underground
repository for long-lived waste.
GERMANY
Some 34 per cent of el
ectricity is produced by 19 nuclear plants. Two sites
are being considered f
or repositories - a former iron ore mine at Konrad and
a site at Gorleben, b
oth in Lower Saxony. An abandoned salt mine at
Bartensleben in the former ea
st German republic has been used since 1981 for
low and intermediate-level w
aste.
SWEDEN
In 1980 it was decided all nuclear power stations - which curre
ntly produce
about half of the country's electricity - would be to phased ou
t by 2010.
The exact timetable is still to be established. Low and intermedi
ate-level
waste is stored underground near the Forsmark nuclear plant, 50 me
tres below
the bed of the Baltic Sea. Investigations are continuing to ident
ify a site
for high-level waste.
BELGIUM
Nuclear power produces 59 per cent 
of electricity. A potential site for the
disposal of high-level and long-liv
ed radioactive waste was identified in
1974 at Mol-Dessel in northern Belgiu
m, where an underground laboratory has
been working on feasibility studies s
ince 1983.
FINLAND
Nuclear power stations produce 29 per cent of electricity
. The country
already has a repository for low and intermediate level waste 
at Olkiluoto.
The search continues for a site for high-level waste.
US
Some 
20 per cent of power is produced by 110 reactors. A site has been
identified
 under Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for a deep-level repository. An
underground l
aboratory is being constructed.
JAPAN
Some 31 per cent of electricity was pr
oduced by 48 nuclear plants last year.
The Power Reactor Fuel Development Co
rporation plans an underground
laboratory at Honrobe, on the island of Hokka
ido, to study disposal of
high-level waste in sedimentary rock.

<TEXT>
THE US government toughened its environmental policy yesterday,
 demanding
that the International Whaling Commission maintain a ban on whali
ng
regardless of scientific findings.
Pro-whaling nations such as Japan and 
Norway said the US decision increased
the likelihood that the body would col
lapse. An IWC scientific committee
report appeared to clear the way for limi
ted catches in the north Atlantic
and in the Antarctic.
Most of the 32 count
ries represented at the IWC's annual conference, which
opened in Kyoto yeste
rday, are in favour of an extension of the decade-long
moratorium, although 
few have been as blunt as the US. Its stance suggests
that the usually accep
ted principle of 'sustainable development' does not
apply to whales.
US offi
cials said the decision followed a policy review by the Clinton
administrati
on, which concluded that a resumption of commercial whaling
would not be sup
ported even if the 'requisite assessment and management
procedures' are agre
ed by the IWC.
The US went further than the UK and most other western countr
ies, and may
prompt debate on a similar toughening of controls over fauna an
d flora
covered by other international agreements.
Mr John Gummer, the UK mi
nister of agriculture, fisheries and food, said
yesterday that lifting the b
an could not be contemplated until whale numbers
were verified.
A report pre
pared by the IWC's scientific committee made clear that there
appeared to be
 sufficient stocks for small quotas of minke whales in the
Antarctic and in 
the north Atlantic.
However, the UK still has concerns about the humaneness 
of whaling methods
and the enforcement of any future agreement on catches. U
K officials said a
lifting of the ban was unlikely, but they also expect tha
t a proposed vote
on a 'whale sanctuary' in the Antarctic will not succeed.

The Norwegian representatives said their government would reconsider its IWC

membership. Japan has also threatened to withdraw but is unlikely to risk a

clash with the new US administration.

<HEADLINE> FT  18 FEB 92 / Russian scientists to assist Chile in 
study of ozone layer depletion </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By LESLIE CRAWFORD </
BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    SANTIAGO </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN and Chilean scient
ists are to begin studying the depletion of the
atmosphere's protective ozon
e layer over Chile.
The joint project will be backed by the air force of Chi
le (Fach) and the
Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, whic
h signed a
scientific protocol in Santiago at the weekend. Russia will provi
de a M-17
aircraft equiped to study atmospheric conditions at high altitudes
. The
research team will include Fach meteorologists as well as scientists f
rom
both countries.
The involvement of the Chilean air force is an indicatio
n of how widespread
concern has become over the problem of ozone depletion. 
Last spring, farmers
and fishermen in Chile's far south raised the alarm by 
reporting that sheep,
wild rabbits and salmon were going blind.
The inhabita
nts of these remote parts also began to suffer from eye
irritations, allergi
es and severe skin burns. The symptoms were blamed on
the growth of the spri
ngtime ozone hole over the Antarctic, which is
beginning to extend over part
s of southern Australia, New Zealand and Chile.
The ozone hole, caused by th
e accumulation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
above the Antarctic, allows inc
reased levels of cancer-causing ultraviolet
rays to reach the earth.
Apart f
rom the Russian-Chilean project, another team of Chilean scientists
began th
is year to monitor levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the
entire lengt
h of the country. Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, has
also sent a
 fact-finding mission to the southern tip of Latin America.

irritations, allergi
es and severe skin burns. The symptoms were blamed on
the growth of the spri
ngtime ozone hole over the Antarctic, which is
beginning to extend over part
s of southern Australia, New Zealand and Chile.
The ozone hole, caused by th
e accumulation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
above the Antarctic, allows inc
reased levels of cancer-causing ultraviolet
rays to reach the earth.
Apart f
rom the Russian-Chilean project, another team of Chilean scientists
began th
is year to monitor levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the
entire lengt
h of the country. Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, has
also sent a
 fact-finding mission to the southern tip of Latin America.

When things are at a low ebb in
 the workshop, the thoughts of Richard
Olivier and Roger Daynes turn to the 
Scott Polar Research Institute at
Cambridge, where one of their Nansen sleds
 lives, much admired, in
retirement.
It is the veteran of a 3,700-mile inter
national trans-Antarctic dog sled
expedition in 1989-90 - the longest dog sl
ed journey ever made.
Snowsled, the company Olivier and Daynes own jointly, 
supplied the sled, one
of three used by the six-man team. The other two were
 American
Greenland-type sleds. When, in mid-transit, the American sleds bro
ke up on
the crevasse-riven terrain, Snowsled was asked to replace it with a
nother of
its Nansen models.
'Our sleds gave no problem and we were naturall
y very pleased,' said Daynes,
a former British Antarctic Survey base command
er.
Daynes, 52, and Olivier, 44, have been making sleds and other expedition

equipment since 1987. The irony is that if they had continued only making
s
leds they would probably not be in business now.
Olivier, a joiner and outdo
or pursuits enthusiast, and Daynes met in 1986.
Initially, Daynes continued 
running his carpentry business in North Wales,
commuting for part of the wee
k to help Olivier in his Gloucestershire
workshop.
An order worth Pounds 9,0
00 from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in 1987
for two complete Nansen s
leds, 130 bridges and many components, convinced
the two that their future l
ay in making sleds together.
Later the same year, Daynes moved house and joi
ned Olivier in his workshop -
a converted 18th-century barn on Prince Charle
s's estate at Highgrove House
near Tetbury.
'BAS was bowled over by the work
manship in our Nansen sledges,' said
Olivier. 'They particularly liked the s
trength, the traditional lashings,
and the way we had adapted a 3,000-year-o
ld design that displays great
flexibility and strength when pulled at up to 
20mph by snowmobile.'
'Neither of us was really a businessman,' Olivier said
. 'We could not see
that, although we continued to get orders for very high 
specification sleds,
we were not going to make money unless we diversified.'

By 1989, turnover had reached Pounds 50,000, but after the two had drawn
Po
unds 10,000 each in wages they found there was no profit at the end of the
y
ear.
'We had an annual order from BAS and also from its American equivalent 
-
about Pounds 30,000 in total,' Daynes said. 'We also had a useful order fr
om
the sponsors of the 1989 International Trans-Antarctic Expedition for 40

mini-Nansen sledges at Pounds 400 a time, for sale in stores in the US. But

still we were struggling to keep going.
'We started to complement the sleds 
by making glass fibre pulks
(lightweight, kit-carrying sleds), but in 1989-9
0 the business was still
making no profit and we both drew no wages.'
In 199
1, the pair formed a limited company. They borrowed Pounds 20,000 from
Lloyd
s Bank under a small business loan guarantee scheme and a further
Pounds 20,
000 from friends, all of whom have a share option in the company.
They also 
run a Pounds 15,000 Lloyds overdraft.
The money helped them to build up stoc
k and to begin trading seriously in
the Ventile high-performance clothing th
ey had been experimenting with for
the past two years.
Ventile is a highly r
esilient cotton fabric. During the second world war, it
was found to increas
e greatly the life expectancy of pilots who had been
shot down over the sea.

Early in 1993, Snowsled took on two women full-time to make Ventile clothes
.
Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Mike Stroud wore Snowsled Ventile clothing crossin
g
the Antarctic on foot that year.
The clothing has the potential for volume
 production and it was while
investigating this that the two felt out of the
ir depth. Early in 1994 they
commissioned a marketing survey for Pounds 1,00
0. 'Although much of it told
us things we already knew, it made it clear whe
re our efforts were best
placed,' said Olivier.
Unfortunately, the report ur
ged them to give up manufacturing the dog
touring and racing sleds they had 
enjoyed making since 1988. 'We think they
are lovely creations. But we sell 
them in very small numbers, so now our
policy is to make them only to order,
' Olivier said.
The other main recommendation of the survey was to place far
 greater
emphasis on marketing - in which they knew they had few skills.
'Ea
rly this year we employed a man with a great deal of marketing experience
to
 work for us for three days a month at a fee of Pounds 1,000,' Olivier
said.
 'After two months he came up with nothing, so we lent on him. He was
hurt t
o the quick and left. We felt very relieved.'
Despite a year in which cutbac
ks in their national Antarctic surveys have
meant smaller sled orders from t
he British and American governments,
Snowsled has sold equipment to Japan an
d Brazil.
However it has been a good year for the Ventile clothing, which is
 likely to
account for between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of this year's ex
pected
turnover of Pounds 150,000.
The two are also optimistic about the fut
ure of two survival and protection
systems - a vacuum mattress stretcher for
 spinal injuries and a lightweight
rescue stretcher - in which they have inv
ested much time. The vacuum
mattress is used by 15 of the 40 UK mountain res
cue teams.
'We see huge potential, but we are spread so thinly between manuf
acturing,
sales and a great deal of R and D that we have no time for marketi
ng these
two products,' Olivier said.
'We are open to offers from anybody wh
o could take on the marketing of all
our products, and at the same time buy 
into the business. But it would have
to be the right person.'

20mph by snowmobile.'
'Neither of us was really a businessman,' Olivier said
. 'We could not see
that, although we continued to get orders for very high 
specification sleds,
we were not going to make money unless we diversified.'

By 1989, turnover had reached Pounds 50,000, but after the two had drawn
Po
unds 10,000 each in wages they found there was no profit at the end of the
y
ear.
'We had an annual order from BAS and also from its American equivalent 
-
about Pounds 30,000 in total,' Daynes said. 'We also had a useful order fr
om
the sponsors of the 1989 International Trans-Antarctic Expedition for 40

mini-Nansen sledges at Pounds 400 a time, for sale in stores in the US. But

still we were struggling to keep going.
'We started to complement the sleds 
by making glass fibre pulks
(lightweight, kit-carrying sleds), but in 1989-9
0 the business was still
making no profit and we both drew no wages.'
In 199
1, the pair formed a limited company. They borrowed Pounds 20,000 from
Lloyd
s Bank under a small business loan guarantee scheme and a further
Pounds 20,
000 from friends, all of whom have a share option in the company.
They also 
run a Pounds 15,000 Lloyds overdraft.
The money helped them to build up stoc
k and to begin trading seriously in
the Ventile high-performance clothing th
ey had been experimenting with for
the past two years.
Ventile is a highly r
esilient cotton fabric. During the second world war, it
was found to increas
e greatly the life expectancy of pilots who had been
shot down over the sea.

Early in 1993, Snowsled took on two women full-time to make Ventile clothes
.
Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Mike Stroud wore Snowsled Ventile clothing crossin
g
the Antarctic on foot that year.
The clothing has the potential for volume
 production and it was while
investigating this that the two felt out of the
ir depth. Early in 1994 they
commissioned a marketing survey for Pounds 1,00
0. 'Although much of it told
us things we already knew, it made it clear whe
re our efforts were best
placed,' said Olivier.
Unfortunately, the report ur
ged them to give up manufacturing the dog
touring and racing sleds they had 
enjoyed making since 1988. 'We think they
are lovely creations. But we sell 
them in very small numbers, so now our
policy is to make them only to order,
' Olivier said.
The other main recommendation of the survey was to place far
 greater
emphasis on marketing - in which they knew they had few skills.
'Ea
rly this year we employed a man with a great deal of marketing experience
to
 work for us for three days a month at a fee of Pounds 1,000,' Olivier
said.
 'After two months he came up with nothing, so we lent on him. He was
hurt t
o the quick and left. We felt very relieved.'
Despite a year in which cutbac
ks in their national Antarctic surveys have
meant smaller sled orders from t
he British and American governments,
Snowsled has sold equipment to Japan an
d Brazil.
However it has been a good year for the Ventile clothing, which is
 likely to
account for between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of this year's ex
pected
turnover of Pounds 150,000.
The two are also optimistic about the fut
ure of two survival and protection
systems - a vacuum mattress stretcher for
 spinal injuries and a lightweight
rescue stretcher - in which they have inv
ested much time. The vacuum
mattress is used by 15 of the 40 UK mountain res
cue teams.
'We see huge potential, but we are spread so thinly between manuf
acturing,
sales and a great deal of R and D that we have no time for marketi
ng these
two products,' Olivier said.
'We are open to offers from anybody wh
o could take on the marketing of all
our products, and at the same time buy 
into the business. But it would have
to be the right person.'
