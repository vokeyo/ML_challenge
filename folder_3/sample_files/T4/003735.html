Officers  at a  Maine  prison                          _____________<br><br>            received  a tip that a female inmate's teenage children would<br><br>            be   smuggling  drugs   into   the  prison   in  her   infant<br><br>            granddaughter's booties.   The superintendent of  the prison,<br><br>            erroneously believing that the tip  had been confirmed by two<br><br>            unconnected  confidential  informants,  authorized   a  strip<br><br>            search of the visitors.  In actuality, the tip had originated<br><br>            from a single anonymous and uncorroborated source.  The strip<br><br>            search  of   the  plaintiff   minors  turned  up   no  drugs.<br><br>            Plaintiffs brought  suit against the  superintendent and  the<br><br>            Commissioner of the Maine  Department of Corrections under 42<br><br>            U.S.C.   1983.1  The  sole question on appeal is  whether the<br><br>            district  court correctly  entered  summary  judgment on  the<br><br>            plaintiffs'  damages claim  in  favor  of the  superintendent<br><br>            based on his assertion of the qualified immunity defense.  We<br><br>            conclude that the  constitutionality of prison-visitor  strip<br><br>            searches is governed by  the standard of reasonable suspicion<br><br>            and  that  a  reasonable  official  in  the  superintendent's<br><br>            position  could have  believed, in  light of  the information<br><br><br>                                            ____________________<br><br>            1.  The named plaintiffs  in this action are Sharon Wood; her<br>            son Philip Thamert; her daughter  Katrina Thamert, on her own<br>            behalf  and as  parent of  Maria Thamert;  and John  and Mary<br>            Foss, as parents and next friends of Michelle Hatch,  Phillip<br>            Thamert's girlfriend.  They purport to assert their claims on<br>            behalf of  a statewide class  of individuals affected  by the<br>            alleged  strip-search  policies  of  the  Maine  Correctional<br>            Center  ("MCC").    The  defendants  are  James  R.  Clemons,<br>            Superintendent of the MCC,  and Donald L. Allen, Commissioner<br>            of the Maine Department of Corrections.<br><br>                                         -2-                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            before him, that the searches did not violate the plaintiffs'<br><br>            constitutional rights.  Accordingly, we affirm.<br><br><br>                                          I<br><br>                  The record, viewed in the  light most favorable to  the<br><br>            plaintiffs, reveals the following.   Since September of 1993,<br><br>            Sharon  Wood had  been an  inmate  at the  Maine Correctional<br><br>            Center ("MCC")  in Windham, Maine, serving  a three-year term<br><br>            of confinement for a drug-related conviction.  From the  time<br><br>            she   was  first   incarcerated   there,   she  was   visited<br><br>            approximately  every other  week by  her son  Phillip Thamert<br><br>            (then seventeen  years of age), her  daughter Katrina Thamert<br><br>            (then sixteen), and Phillip's girlfriend Michelle Hatch (then<br><br>            seventeen).   On each visit, Katrina brought along her infant<br><br>            daughter  Maria (then  seven months  old).   Nothing happened<br><br>            during any of these visits to arouse any suspicion of illegal<br><br>            activity on  the part of Wood  or her visitors.   Wood had no<br><br>            record of drug violations while at MCC.<br><br>                  The  events  leading  to the  strip  search  of  Wood's<br><br>            visitors  began with a telephone call to the MCC by Detective<br><br>            Peter   Herring,  the  State  Police  Department's  appointed<br><br>            liaison  to  the prison.   On  a  "large number"  of previous<br><br>            occasions,   Herring   had   provided  MCC   officials   with<br><br>            information obtained from his  own confidential sources about<br><br>            criminal activity  at the prison.   Herring's information had<br><br>            invariably turned out to be accurate in the past.<br><br><br>                                         -3-                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                  On January 5, 1994,  Herring called the MCC to  provide<br><br>            another tip.  Corrections  Officers Charles Baker and Stephen<br><br>            Butts,  both responsible  for criminal  investigations within<br><br>            the MCC, fielded Herring's call together.  Herring told Baker<br><br>            and Butts that he had obtained information that inmate Sharon<br><br>            Wood was receiving drugs from the outside.  Herring said that<br><br>            he  had been told by  a confidential informant  who, in turn,<br><br>            had  heard from an  anonymous source that  Wood was receiving<br><br>            drugs during visits, and  that the drugs were being  smuggled<br><br>            into  the  prison  in  her  infant  granddaughter's  booties.<br><br>            Herring disclosed  to Baker  and Butts that  he had  obtained<br><br>            this  information on a second-hand basis, and that at no time<br><br>            had Herring spoken directly  to the original anonymous source<br><br>            about the tip.  Herring  himself had no personal knowledge of<br><br>            Sharon Wood or the persons who were supposedly bringing drugs<br><br>            to her.  Herring did not provide Baker or Butts with the name<br><br>            of either  his confidential informant or  the original source<br><br>            of the tip.2<br><br>                  Soon after  the phone  call, Officer  Baker prepared  a<br><br>            written  report of  the conversation  with Herring.   Baker's<br><br>            report,  however, contained  an important  inaccuracy.   That<br><br>            inaccuracy may be what ultimately allowed the strip search to<br><br>            take place.   The report  implied that the  information about<br><br><br>                                            ____________________<br><br>            2.  The record does not clearly indicate whether Herring ever<br>            knew the identity of the original tipster.<br><br>                                         -4-                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Wood  had  been  provided  to  Herring  by  two  independent,                                                             ___________<br><br>            mutually corroborating confidential informants:                                   _______________________<br><br>                  Det Peter Herring  advised Butts  and Baker  that<br>                  he received  information from  two separate  CI's<br>                  that prisoner Sharon  Wood (Dorm 2)  is allegedly<br>                  receiving drugs  during visits.  Supposedly,  the<br>                  drugs   are  hidden   in  Wood's  granddaughter's<br>                  booties.    Security projects  office  to monitor<br>                  and   will   request   appropriate  action   when<br>                  required.<br><br>            Thus,  by   indicating  that   two   unconnected  "CI's"   --                                           ___<br><br>            confidential  informants  -- had  provided  Detective Herring<br><br>            with  the  same  information,  Baker's  report  significantly<br><br>            overrepresented the actual reliability of Herring's tip.<br><br>                  Five days later,  on January 10, 1994,  defendant James<br><br>            R.  Clemons, Superintendent of  the MCC,  met with  Baker and<br><br>            Butts  to conduct  their  regular weekly  review of  security<br><br>            matters at the prison.  At this meeting, Clemons read Baker's<br><br>            report of  the information  received from Detective  Herring.<br><br>            It is undisputed that,  as a result of reviewing  the report,<br><br>            Clemons  came  to believe  in  good faith  that  two separate<br><br>            confidential sources had provided Herring  with precisely the<br><br>            same tip concerning drug-smuggling by Sharon Wood's visitors.<br><br>            Clemons  signed Baker's  report  to acknowledge  that he  had<br><br>            reviewed it and to confirm that the  security projects office<br><br>            run by Baker and Butts would monitor the situation and notify<br><br>            Clemons if  and when  any further action  became appropriate.<br><br>            Following  the  January  10  meeting,  no  one  at  the  MCC,<br><br>            including Clemons, conducted  any additional investigation or<br><br><br>                                         -5-                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            follow-up concerning the Herring tip.  No action was taken on<br><br>            the tip prior to the plaintiffs' next visit to the MCC.<br><br>                  That visit  came on February  22, 1994.   At 10:00 a.m.<br><br>            that  morning,  Officer Baker  noticed  the  names of  Wood's<br><br>            children  on  the  prison  visitor  schedule  for  that  day.<br><br>            Recalling  the  phone  conversation  with  Peter  Herring  on<br><br>            January 5, Baker paged Superintendent Clemons, who was at his<br><br>            home, to request authorization to  conduct a strip search  of<br><br>            the  visitors based on the Herring tip.  About twenty minutes<br><br>            later,  Clemons responded  to Baker's  page and  authorized a<br><br>            strip search of Wood's scheduled visitors.  Baker then called<br><br>            Detective  Herring to  inform  him of  the impending  search.<br><br>            Herring agreed to stand by in case arrests had to be made.<br><br>                  Katrina  and  Phillip  Thamert,  Katrina's  baby,   and<br><br>            Michelle  Hatch arrived  at  the prison  at  about 1:20  p.m.<br><br>            After Katrina, Phillip and  Michelle signed in, Officer Baker<br><br>            and another officer took  them aside and told them  that they<br><br>            would  have to submit to a search for contraband drugs before<br><br>            they would be  permitted to  see Sharon Wood.   Baker read  a<br><br>            "consent  to search" form  to the visitors,  advising them of<br><br>            their constitutional rights to refuse  to give consent and to<br><br>            require the prison to obtain search warrants, and to withdraw<br><br>            consent  at any time prior  to the conclusion  of the search.<br><br>            The form also said that if the visitors refused to consent to<br><br>            the  search, their  visiting privileges would  be immediately<br><br><br><br>                                         -6-                                          6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            and indefinitely  terminated.  Neither Baker  nor the consent<br><br>            form  made clear that the  search to which  the visitors were<br><br>            being  asked  to consent  was a  strip  search.   After Baker<br><br>            finished reading,  each of Wood's visitors  (except the baby)<br><br>            signed a consent form.<br><br>                  Katrina Thamert and  her baby  were then  taken by  two<br><br>            female officers to  a private bathroom, and Phillip was taken<br><br>            by  two  male  officers  to  a  private storage  room,  while<br><br>            Michelle Hatch  waited in the  main reception area.   Katrina<br><br>            was asked to remove  her baby's clothing and diaper.   One of<br><br>            the  two  female officers  visually  inspected  the baby  and<br><br>            checked  the   baby's  clothes  and  diaper  for  contraband.<br><br>            Katrina  held  her baby  at  all times,  and  neither officer<br><br>            touched the baby during the search.  Katrina was then told to<br><br>            put the baby's clothes back on.  Although there were no drugs<br><br>            found on the baby or her clothing, the searches continued.<br><br>                  In the storage room,  Phillip was told by the  two male<br><br>            officers to take off his clothing, and he did so.  One of the<br><br>            male  officers  searched  through his  clothing  and visually<br><br>            inspected his  mouth and ears.  He was asked to lift his arms<br><br>            and his  genitals.   Neither officer  touched Phillip  at any<br><br>            time.   He was then permitted to  dress and was taken back to<br><br>            the reception area.<br><br>                  Phillip  held  Katrina's  baby  in  the  reception area<br><br>            while  Katrina was searched in the bathroom by the two female<br><br><br><br>                                         -7-                                          7<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            officers.  After removing her clothing, she was asked to lift<br><br>            her breasts,  and then was told  to squat and cough.   One of<br><br>            the  officers manually  searched  her clothing  and  visually<br><br>            inspected  her mouth  and  ears.    Neither of  the  officers<br><br>            touched  Katrina during  the search.   She  was permitted  to<br><br>            dress  and return to the reception area.  The female officers<br><br>            then  escorted  Michelle Hatch  into  the  bathroom and  went<br><br>            through the same procedure as they had with Katrina.<br><br>                  None of the  searches having turned up  contraband, the<br><br>            visitors  were  permitted  to  see  Sharon  Wood.    Katrina,<br><br>            Phillip,  and Michelle  told Wood  about the  strip searches.<br><br>            Following the  visit, Wood  filed an internal  grievance with<br><br>            the  MCC.   After an  internal investigation,  Superintendent<br><br>            Clemons responded  to Wood  with a memorandum  asserting that<br><br>            the strip searches had not violated any prison  regulation or<br><br>            policy.   Shortly thereafter,  the Commissioner of  the Maine<br><br>            Department of  Corrections affirmed Clemons'  decision.

The district court, on cross-motions for<br><br>            summary judgment  and partial  summary judgment,  granted the<br><br>            defendants' motion  for summary judgment in  its entirety and<br><br><br>                                         -8-                                          8<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            denied the plaintiffs' motions for class certification and to<br><br>            file a second amended complaint.<br><br>                  The plaintiffs appeal solely from the district  court's<br><br>            entry of judgment in  favor of defendant Clemons as  to their<br><br>            claim  for   damages  under    1983  based   on  his  alleged<br><br>            violations of  the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment  rights.  The<br><br>            only question in  this appeal is  whether the district  court<br><br>            correctly  concluded  that Clemons  is entitled  to qualified<br><br>            immunity from  the  plaintiffs' damages  claim under    1983.<br><br>            The  plaintiffs  argue  that   Clemons  is  not  entitled  to<br><br>            qualified immunity here,  because any reasonable  official in<br><br>            Clemons' position would have  known that the Fourth Amendment<br><br>            does not  permit officials to undertake a  strip search based<br><br>            on  an uncorroborated  tip received  from a  single anonymous<br><br>            source.<br><br>                  We  review  the  district  court's  grant   of  summary<br><br>            judgment de novo.

The difficulty  with this argument  is that it<br><br>            seeks to  defeat Clemons' claim  of immunity by  charging him<br><br>            with  notice of facts that were not  actually known to him at<br><br>            the time he made the decision to authorize the searches.<br><br>                  The issue  on appeal  is whether  Clemons, and not  any<br><br>            other  defendant  or  potential  defendant,  is  entitled  to<br><br>            qualified  immunity.    The  inquiry must  focus  on  whether<br><br>            Clemons  himself acted as a reasonable  official might.

Here,  there is  no dispute  that            ______<br><br>            Clemons was  told by  his staff  and genuinely  believed that<br><br>            Detective   Herring   had   learned  from   two   unconnected                                                        _________________<br><br>            confidential  informants that  Sharon  Wood's  visitors  were            ________________________<br><br>            smuggling drugs into the MCC in her granddaughter's booties.<br><br>                  The plaintiffs  respond by  arguing that  Clemons acted<br><br>            unreasonably  in accepting  Baker's  report as  true  without<br><br>            conducting further  investigation.   We disagree.   While the<br><br>            mistake  that led  to  Clemons being  misinformed  as to  the<br><br>            nature of  the tip is not  to be condoned, we  cannot say, on<br><br>            the totality of the circumstances  of this case, that Clemons<br><br>            was unjustified  in accepting Officer Baker's  report at face<br><br>            value.     Over  the   course  of  their   five-year  working<br><br>            relationship, Clemons had grown to trust Baker to provide him<br><br>            with  reliable information on investigatory matters.  Indeed,<br><br>            Clemons  testified at  his deposition  that Baker  had always<br><br>            provided  him  with  accurate information  and,  in  Clemons'<br><br>            estimation, was "not one to make assumptions."  Similarly, in<br><br>            Clemons' experience, information provided by Peter Herring to<br><br>            the  MCC in  a large  number of  previous investigations  had<br><br>            always turned out to  be accurate, and Clemons had  thus come<br><br>            to consider Herring  himself to be a reliable and trustworthy<br><br><br><br>                                         -17-                                          17<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            source of information.   The  plaintiffs do  not allege  that<br><br>            Clemons' general trust in Baker or in Herring was unjustified<br><br>            or misplaced.<br><br>                  It  is  only  fair  to  conclude  that  Clemons  had  a<br><br>            reasonable  basis  to  believe  that  the  tip  about  Wood's<br><br>            visitors -- as reported in Baker's memorandum --  had already<br><br>            been tested for  reliability by both  Herring and Baker,  and<br><br>            that there was no need for Clemons himself to conduct further<br><br>            investigation  into  the  tip's  sources.   And,  if  Clemons<br><br>            reasonably believed that the  tip, as reported, was reliable,<br><br>            it  would  be inconsistent  with  the  basic  purpose of  the<br><br>            qualified immunity defense --  i.e., to protect an official's                                           ____<br><br>            reasonable  judgments  from post  hoc  attack  -- to  deprive                                        _________<br><br>            Clemons  of that defense merely because the nature of the tip<br><br>            was, through  no fault of  his own,  erroneously reported  to<br><br>            him.6  See  United States  v.

However, there was                                      ___ ___<br>            no indication in that case that the warden had any reason  to<br>            be unaware  of the information's unreliability  or to believe<br>            that  the officer's  statements  (unlike Detective  Herring's<br>            statements  here)  were  independently trustworthy.    In any<br>            event, in rejecting the  warden's argument, the Sixth Circuit<br>            stated,  "we do not impose  a duty on  wardens to investigate<br>            the  reliability of all their officers' conclusions."  Id. at                                                                   ___<br>            557.<br><br>                                         -19-                                          19<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            mutually  corroborating confidential informants, both of whom<br><br>            Clemons believed had made the highly specific allegation that<br><br>            visitors  were hiding  drugs in  an infant's  booties for  an<br><br>            inmate who  was serving time for a  drug conviction.  Nor can<br><br>            we ignore  that Clemons' assessment of  the tip's reliability<br><br>            was  favorably affected  by  his awareness  that it  had been<br><br>            delivered to the MCC  by Peter Herring,  who, to the best  of<br><br>            Clemons'   knowledge,  had   never  before   provided  prison<br><br>            officials with information that had turned out to be false.<br><br>                  Viewed  in  this light,  it  is difficult  to  say that<br><br>            Clemons'  decision to authorize the searches was "objectively<br><br>            legally unreasonable."   Anderson, 483 U.S. at  641.  Mindful                                     ________<br><br>            that "'if there  is a  legitimate question as  to whether  an<br><br>            official's  conduct  constitutes a  constitutional violation,<br><br>            the official is entitled  to qualified immunity,'" Singer, 49                                                               ______<br><br>            F.3d at  845 (internal quotations omitted),  we conclude that<br><br>            Clemons  is entitled to the  protection of that  defense.  An<br><br>            objectively  reasonable official,  presented with all  of the<br><br>            information  in Clemons'  possession and  similarly situated,<br><br>            could  very well have believed that there existed a basis for<br><br>            reasonable suspicion that Wood's  visitors would be smuggling<br><br>            drugs into the MCC.8  Cf.  United States v. Wangler, 987 F.2d                                  ___  _____________    _______<br><br><br>                                            ____________________<br><br>            8.  Plaintiffs do  not raise,  and we therefore  deem waived,<br>            any  argument that  the  tip's focus  on  the baby's  booties<br>            precluded  the existence  of  individualized suspicion  as to<br>            Katrina Thamert, Phillip Thamert, or Michelle Hatch.<br><br>                                         -20-                                          20<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            228,  230  (5th  Cir.  1993) (information  provided  by  "two<br><br>            unconnected informants" contributed  to reasonable  suspicion<br><br>            that suspect was carrying drugs).9<br><br><br>                                          IV<br><br>                  We  conclude  that  defendant  Clemons  is entitled  to<br><br>            qualified immunity  from personal liability  for his  alleged<br><br>            violation  of the plaintiffs' constitutional right, as prison<br><br>            visitors,  not to  be strip  searched except  upon reasonable<br><br>            suspicion that  they were  carrying contraband.   Clemons, in<br><br>            defensible reliance on written information provided to him by<br><br>            a  trusted prison  official, believed  in good  faith  that a<br><br>            police  detective  with  a  proven track  record  of  feeding<br><br>            invariably accurate  investigative information to  the prison<br><br>            had  learned that two unconnected confidential informants had                              ___<br><br>            separately reported  the same highly specific allegation that<br><br>            the visitors  of a named  female inmate were  smuggling drugs<br><br>                                            ____________________<br><br>            9.  Of  course,  to  say  such  a  belief  would  have   been<br>            reasonable  is not to imply  that it would  have been legally<br>            correct.  Lowinger  v. Broderick,  50 F.3d 61,  65 (1st  Cir.                      ________     _________<br>            1995)  ("[E]ven  erroneous  decisions  by  officials  may  be<br>            entitled to qualified immunity."); Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d                                               ______    ______<br>            259, 263  (1st Cir. 1992) ("'The  qualified immunity standard<br>            gives ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but<br>            the plainly  incompetent or  those who knowingly  violate the<br>            law.'"  (quoting Hunter v.  Bryant, 502 U.S.  224, 229 (1991)                             ______     ______<br>            (per   curiam)   (internal  quotation   marks   and  citation<br>            omitted)).  Although we  sustain the defendant's assertion of<br>            the qualified immunity  defense, we express no  opinion as to<br>            the legal "correctness" of  any belief that Clemons  may have<br>            had  (based  on the  facts as  he  knew them)  concerning the<br>            existence of  reasonable suspicion that  the plaintiffs  were<br>            engaged in illegal activity.<br><br>                                         -21-                                          21<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            into the prison  in her infant  granddaughter's booties.   On<br><br>            the record  before us, an objectively  reasonable official in<br><br>            possession  of  this   information  and  otherwise  similarly<br><br>            situated to  Clemons could have decided  there was reasonable<br><br>            suspicion  to believe  that Sharon  Wood's visitors  would be<br><br>            smuggling  drugs into the MCC.   The district court therefore<br><br>            properly  granted  summary  judgment in  favor  of  defendant<br><br>            Clemons.<br><br><br>                  Affirmed.
