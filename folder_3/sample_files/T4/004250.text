TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00

May 2003

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Engineered Barrier System (EBS) represents one system in the performance of the Yucca 
Mountain high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repository to isolate and prevent the transport of 
radionuclides from the site to the accessible environment. Breached Waste Package and Drip 
Shield Experiments (BWPDSE) were performed at the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear 
Security Administration Nevada Support Facility in North Las Vegas, NV in the A-1 lowbay 
between May 2, 2002 and July 25, 2002. Data collected from the BWPDSE will be used to 
support the flux splitting model used in Analysis and Modeling Report ANL-WIS-PA-000001 
REV 00 ICN 03 EBS Radionuclide Transport Abstraction (BSC 2001a). Tests were conducted 
by dripping water from heights representing the drift crown or wall on a full-scale section of a 
drip shield with both smooth and rough surfaces. The drip shields had machined square breaches 
that represent the general corrosion breaches or nodes in the WAPDEG Analysis of Waste 
Package and Drip Shield Degradation AMR (CRWMS M&O 2000d). Tests conducted during 
the BWPDSE included: initial tests to determine the splash radius distances and spread factor 
from the line of drip impact, single patch tests to determine the amount of water collected in 
target breaches from splashing or rivulet flow, multiple patch tests to determine the amount of 
water collected in several breaches from both splashing and rivulet flow, and bounding flow rate 
tests. Supplemental data were collected to provide additional information for rivulet spread, pan 
evaporation in the test chamber, and water temperatures of the input water and drip shield 
surface water. The primary flow mechanism observed on both smooth and rough surfaces was 
rivulet flow, not film flow. Lateral rivulet spread distances were, in general, wider on the 
smooth drip shield surface than on the rough drip shield surface. There were substantial 
differences between the mechanisms of rivulet formation and movement on smooth and rough 
drip shield surfaces. Water collected in breaches was a function of the location of drip impact 
upstream from the target breach, i.e., impact breaches must be directly above or slightly to the 
side of the breaches in order for a substantial volume of water to collect in breaches. Splash 
droplets contributed a small portion of the water collected in breaches. Mass balances showed 
that evaporation from the drip shield was a large component of water loss. This was particularly 
manifested during low flow runs of the bounding flow rate tests where test duration was around 
five hours. 

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Data collected from the Breached Waste Package and Drip Shield Experiments (BWPDSE) will 
be used to support the flux splitting model used in future revisions of the Analysis and Modeling 
Report (AMR) ANL-WIS-PA-000001, EBS Radionuclide Transport Abstraction (BSC 2001a). 
The purpose of the BWPDSE was to collect information on water flow paths and penetration 
through breaches on drip shield surfaces so that the flux splitting model can be both validated 
and made more complete with respect to water mass losses caused by splashing and evaporation. 
The scope of this report is to document the BWPDSE by: 
• Presenting test configurations and operating conditions 
• Summarizing test data and providing data submittal tracking numbers 
• Presenting test results 
Both waste package (WP) and drip shield (DS) geometries are applicable to the flux splitting 
model and data generated in these tests will be used to describe seepage flux entering breaches 
through both DSs and WPs. A DS surface was used in these tests for simplification, and future 
testing to support the EBS radionuclide transport abstraction may include tests performed on WP 
surfaces if it is determined that such data are required. 
1.2 BACKGROUND 
The Engineered Barrier System (EBS) represents one system in the performance of the Yucca 
Mountain high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repository to isolate and prevent the transport of 
radionuclides from the site to the accessible environment. The primary transport mechanism for 
radionuclides is liquid water that may penetrate the EBS through breaches in the drip shields 
(DS) and waste packages (WP), which make up the components of the EBS. Water flux 
(represented by the letter “q”) can enter the breaches via three different mechanisms: q(direct), a 
droplet falls directly through the patch (hole); q(film) liquid enters a breach by film or rivulet 
flow and; q(splash) liquid enters a breach as a result of liquid being pushed or lofted from a point 
of drip impact on the DS. A patch is a modeling term for a breach in the DS or WP. The flux 
splitting model (BSC 2001a) is conservatively based on the following assumptions: 
1. Drip impact occurs without a loss of water mass from splattering and evaporation. 
2. Dripping flux falls exactly at the crown of the DS. This limits the zone of impact to the 
horizontal surface across the DS crown and does not include the curved surface that 
would cause droplets to be deflected from the DS. 
3. The flux passing through a DS patch is proportional to the ratio of the length of the 
penetration in the axial direction to the total axial length of the DS. In this assumption 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 1
all fluid that drips and flows from the DS crown toward a penetration will be collected if 
the axial locations of the source and patch coincide (BSC 2001a). 
The current model does not consider drop mass loss and splash radius following impact. The 
water droplets projected during impact, in reality, may land on the DS surface in another location 
or be completely thrown off of the DS. Because natural processes were in effect, these 
experiments represented effects not considered in the current models, which were not capable of 
incorporating the random processes inherent in water dripping onto both dry and wetted surfaces. 
Test controls included the drip seepage rate, drip impact location, breach location, and breach 
size. General corrosion breaches were the only breaches considered in these tests and were based 
on the nodes or square patches of area 0.072144 m2 (0.2685963-m square) from the WAPDEG 
Analysis of Waste Package and Drip Shield Degradation AMR (CRWMS M&O 2000d). For 
testing purposes the patch size in the BWPDSE was rounded to 0.270-m square in place of the 
patch size (0.2685963-m square) used in CRWMS M&O 2000d. The drip shield length was 
constructed to 10 patch lengths, or 2.7 m. In CRWMS M&O 2000d, general corrosion patches 
did not appear on DSs before 10,000 years after placement, while manufacturing defects were 
predicted to appear after 1000 years. 
Environmental conditions of interest in the BWPDSE were temperature and relative humidity 
(RH). The test was performed in an enclosed insulated chamber where the RH was elevated 
above 80%. It is important to note that these tests did not consider the effects of elevated 
temperature. It was not the intent to maintain test environment conditions, i.e., temperature and 
RH, at the expected repository environment, but conditions were maintained to provide accurate 
water collection. 
1.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE 
This technical report was prepared in accordance with Administrative Procedure (AP)-3.11Q, 
Technical Reports. The technical work plan (TWP) that governed the work for the BWPDSE 
was TWP-MGR-MD-000015 Rev. 2, Technical Work Plan For: Engineered Barrier System 
Department Modeling and Testing FY 02 Work Activities (BSC 2002a), which was prepared in 
accordance with AP-2.27Q, Rev. 0, Quality Determination and Planning for Scientific, 
Engineering, and Regulatory Compliance Activities. Specific activities for the BWPDSE, 
including the writing of this report, are described in The Test Plan for: Atlas Breached Waste 
Package and Drip Shield Experiments, SITP-02-EBS-005 (BSC 2002b). This activity was 
subject to the Quality Assurance Requirements and Description (DOE 2003) requirements. 
Other quality assurance features of this testing program include: 
The Field Work Package (FWP)-EBS –02-001, Engineered Barrier Systems – Breached Waste 
Package and Drip Shield Testing (YMP 2002) which defines the execution plan, facility 
requirements, and health and safety guidelines of the BWPDSE. 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 2
Details of the test configuration and records of the test execution were documented in scientific 
notebook numbers SN-M&O-SCI-043-V1, SN-M&O-SCI-043-V2, and SN-M&O-SCI-043-V3, 
per AP-SIII.1Q, Scientific Notebooks (Howard 2002a, Howard 2002b, and Howard 2002c). 
All instruments were calibrated in the Bechtel Nevada calibration laboratory and calibrations 
were documented in scientific notebook SN-M&O-SCI-043-V1 (Howard 2002a, pp. 24-34) and 
SN-M&O-043-V2 (Howard 2002b, pp. 223-240). 
All data were entered manually into the scientific notebook, and then entered manually into MS 
Word documents for submittal to the TDMS. Data were reviewed and verified in accordance 
with AP-2.14Q prior to being submitted to the TDMS. Because the data were entered manually 
into the scientific notebook and then submitted to the TDMS via MS Word documents, the only 
AP-SV.1Q controls listed in the TWP that applied were those outlining personal computer 
security and a regular back up of test files. These controls were in place during the BWPDSE. 
The only software utilized during the BWPDSE was MS Excel ‘97 for performing calculations 
and making data plots. All formulas, inputs and outputs are documented and this software is, 
therefore, exempt from the requirements of AP-SI.1Q per AP-3.11Q Sec. 5.1.3e. 
During the BWPDSE, BSC QA conducted a surveillance (Krisha 2002) and found the testing to 
be programmatically compliant. No conditions adverse to quality were identified. 
1.4 EBS BREACHED DRIP SHIELD TEST DESCRIPTION 
The BWPDSE was conducted at the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security 
Administration Nevada Support Facility in North Las Vegas, NV in the A-1 lowbay between 
May 2, 2002 and July 25, 2002. Testing was performed by dripping water on smooth and rough 
DS surfaces with cut square breaches (0.270-m square). Water was dripped on the DS surfaces 
at nominal rates of 2 m3/yr (3.8 g/min), 0.2 m3/yr (0.38 g/min), and 20 m3/yr (38 g/min) and 
allowed to collect in breaches or gutters placed on the DS boundaries. Following each test, the 
collected water was weighed at each station and a mass balance performed. Before tests were 
conducted, initial tests were performed to determine splash distances after drop impact and 
lateral rivulet spread from the line of impact. In some of the initial tests Blue #1 food coloring 
was used in the drip water in order to make rivulets and splashes more visible on the drip shield 
surface. This practice was used sparingly during the initial tests and was not used during the 
formal testing because the food coloring stained the DS surface, making it necessary to 
thoroughly clean the DS surface before the next test run. The measurements taken during the 
initial tests were used to select drip impact locations for formal tests. All tests were performed at 
full-scale with respect to drop distance and DS curvature.

2. TEST CONFIGURATION 
2.1 TEST DESIGN CRITERIA 
The following criteria applied to the test design: 
1. DS breaches represent square general corrosion patches of area 0.072144 m2 (0.2685963 
by 0.2685963 m), based on the AMR ANL-EBS-PA-000001 REV 00 ICN 01 WAPDEG 
Analysis of Waste Package and Drip Shield Degradation (CRWMS M&O 2000d). 
Actual breaches used in the BWPDSE were machined (or cut) into the DS with 
dimensions of 0.270 by 0.270 m. 
2. The WP diameter (1.564 m) used in the BWPDSE represents those of the 21 PWR WP 
(CRWMS M&O 2000b). The WP diameter is the WP footprint beneath the DS and 
represents the seepage area over the DS as illustrated in Figure 1. 
3. The dripping distance was based on AMR design parameters, and thus drip velocity was 
represented on a full scale. The EBS/repository design parameters and values used in 
the BWPDSE, including reference to full DS dimensions, are listed in Table 1. Based on 
the values listed in Table 1, the distance from the top of the drift to the crown of the DS 
is 2.173 m. Drip impact locations were positioned along lateral lines at the crown, 33o 
along the DS curvature, and 16.5o along the DS curvature (see Figure 1). 
4. The nominal seepage drip rate was based on an average of the seepage flux rates 
expected in the repository (BSC 2001b). It is assumed that the DS will intercept all 
seepage flux entering the drift and for the purposes of these tests, seepage flux was 
represented as drips per unit time per unit area of DS above the waste package (WP) 
footprint. A nominal seepage rate of 2 m3/yr was used in the q(splash) and q(film) tests, 
while bounding rates of 0.2m3/yr and 20m3/yr were used during the bounding flow rate 
tests. 
5. The condition of DS surfaces during the time they are not expected to fail (i.e., 1000 
years for manufacturing defects and 10,000 years for general corrosion) was difficult to 
predict and replicate. Two different surfaces were tested: a standard machined stainless 
steel surface (the most conservative condition), and a rough surface that only 
approximated DS conditions expected to exist during DS failure. Both surface 
conditioning processes can be replicated. 
6. The tests were conducted in an environment that would minimize evaporation, but not 
necessarily simulate repository conditions. This was achieved by conducting the tests in 
an insulated test chamber. During formal testing (not including all initial tests), the 
relative humidity (RH) in the chamber was maintained above 80%. The test chamber 
temperature was not directly controlled during testing, but was monitored.

2.2 DRIP SHIELD MATERIALS AND SURFACE CONDITIONS 
The DS was constructed of ¼ inch stainless steel and supported by an aluminum frame. For 
purposes of the BWPDSE, a full-scale section of DS was used in place of a complete DS. The 
DS section design was based on the full DS dimensions outlined in Table 1. The DS was 2.7-m 
long, 1.27-m wide, and 1.62-m high. A diagram of the drip shield with dimensions and patch 
(breach) locations is shown in Figure 2 and a picture of the DS and frame can be viewed in 
Figure 3 (Howard 2002a, p. 14 and p. 16). The smooth DS surface was formed by polishing the 
stock stainless steel with 60-grit sandpaper on a circular sander. A close-up photograph of the 
stainless steal DS surface is shown in Figure 4. The rough surface was formed by covering the 
stainless steel DS surface with a silica anti-slip coating (Howard 2002b, p. 70). A picture of the 
rough DS can be viewed in Figure 5 and a picture of the texture can be viewed in Figure 6. 
2.3 TEST CHAMBER DESIGN AND INSTRUMENTATION 
The test chamber was constructed from standard metal framing material and plywood. The 
chamber was insulated with R-5.7 rated insulation all sides and ceiling (Howard 2002c, p. 113). 
The test chamber dimensions were 3.66-m long, 2.74-m wide, and 2.44-m high (Figure 7). 
Water vapor was introduced into the chamber with the use of commercial humidifiers. Initially 
two humidifiers were used. A third humidifier was added before the q(film) tests (see Section 
2.1.6) on the smooth DS for the purpose of increasing the RH at a faster rate and maintaining a 
higher RH in the chamber. During testing the RH was maintained at 80% or higher. A 
ventilation fan was used during testing to circulate air around the test chamber. Figure 7 shows a 
diagram of the test chamber with locations of humidifiers, the ventilation fan, and monitoring 
instrumentation. Test chamber instrumentation is listed with all testing M&TE in Appendix A. 
The test chamber ceiling had three slots positioned along the length of the chamber ceiling to 
allow water drips to fall on the DS crown, the 16.5o line, and the 33o line. The slots were 
covered during testing with a 1.5-in styrofoam sheet, except for one of the many pre-cut access 
holes where the drip tower (see Section 2.4.1) was located. The test chamber environment data 
were collected before and after each test and recorded by hand on data collection sheets that were 
entered into the scientific notebook. 
2.4 WATER INJECTION AND COLLECTION SYSTEMS 
2.4.1 Water Injection 
Water drips were introduced into the test environment by injecting water through an aquarium 
diffuser using a metering pump. The aquarium diffuser is a porous medium that allows water 
drops to collect slowly and fall after enough mass has collected to break the surface tension. A 
test performed to measure the droplet mass from an aquarium diffuser resulted in a mean mass of 
0.141 grams (Howard 2002b, pp. 4-6). This method was used because it is similar to the 
processes that occur when water droplets collect and fall from the drift crown. The diffuser was 
mounted in a clear PVC tube (drip tower) and was adjusted to three different heights during the 
tests, which represent the drip distances between the DS surface at the crown, 16.5o, and 33o and 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 5
the corresponding position on the drift wall (see Figure 1). Figure 8 presents a photograph of the 
drip tower showing the three possible drip positions at 2.17-m (crown), 2.22-m (16.5o), and 2.31- 
m (33o) (Howard 2002a, p. 36). The drip tower was movable and was positioned over the 
designated impact location through the one of the three slots in the test chamber ceiling. 
The input water rate was measured by weighing the initial and final water masses over the test 
time duration. Test duration times were measured with a stopwatch from the time the first drop 
impacted the drip shield to the time when the metering pump was shut off. 
2.4.2 Water Collection System 
Water that was dripped over the DS surface was collected at various stations that constituted 
water passing through breaches, water passing around breaches and running off the DS, water 
splashing over the edge of the DS boundary, and residual water that adhered to the DS surface. 
Water that ran into breaches was collected in pans that were mounted on the inside of the DS. 
Paper towels were placed inside the collection pans to prevent water from splashing out of the 
pan and to direct water into the pan from the breach inside edges. Water that passed by breaches 
and off the DS surface collected in gutters mounted to the front and back of the DS. Water that 
splashed off the front, back, and sides of the DS was caught and directed into the same collection 
gutters used to collect runoff. Residual water that remained on the DS surface was wiped up 
with pre-weighed lint-less paper towels. Diagrams of the gutters and splash shields mounted on 
the DS are shown in Figure 9. Six breaches and four gutters were used during the tests. The 
numbering system for the breaches is shown in Figure 4 and the numbering system for the 
gutters and splash shields is shown in Figure 9. 
Water was collected from the gutters and splash shields in the same manner as it was collected 
from the DS surface. Water was wiped up with pre-weighed lint-less paper towels from gutters 
and splash shields, then weighed to determine the net moisture picked up by the towels. Water 
mass collected through breaches was determined by pre-weighing the collection pans then 
weighing them again following each test. The water masses collected at each station (i.e., 
breaches 1-6, gutters 1-4, and splash shields 1-4) were recorded by hand on data sheets then 
attached in the scientific notebook. 
In the course of the testing it became evident that exposed towels could exchange moisture mass 
with the test chamber air for a net mass gain or loss. In order to provide data on the possible 
mass change for exposed towels, a reference towel was used in tests starting with the single 
patch tests for the rough DS surface. These data were applied only to the towels used to prevent 
splashing in the breach collection pans because the towels used to swab water from the DS, 
gutters, and splash shields were either weighed shortly before use or placed in pre-weighed 
sealed containers before and after use. 
2.5 SUPPORTING MEASUREMENTS 
Supporting measurements were those additional measurements that did not contribute directly to 
the collection of water, but provided additional data to add to the understanding of water 
pathways, in the form of rivulet flow and evaporation from the DS surface. These additional 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 6
measurements include pan evaporation, water temperature, and rivulet spread. These 
measurements were not taken during every test, but enough measurements were taken to provide 
sufficient data to understand these processes. 
2.5.1 Pan Evaporation Measurements 
Evaporation in the test chamber was measured during tests with a 20.3-cm by 20.3-cm square 
plastic pan. The procedure used was to fill the pan with enough water to just cover the bottom 
then weigh the pan and water before and after the test. The pan was weighed without water to 
get a tare weight of 67.7 grams (Howard 2002a, p. 70). The evaporation pan data is not a direct 
representation of evaporation from the DS surface because of the differences between the 
exposed water surface area on the DS surface and the pan. The evaporation pan data is used as a 
general reference for the evaporation potential inherent under chamber conditions. 
2.5.2 Rivulet Spread Measurements 
Rivulet spread measurements were taken as a part of the initial tests on the smooth and rough DS 
surfaces to provide data for determining the impact locations for the formal testing. The practice 
of measuring the maximum and minimum rivulet spread was made a part of the data collection 
routine during the single patch q(film) tests on the smooth DS surface. Measurements were 
performed with a commercial ruler or tape measure from the axial line of drip impact down the 
face of the DS. The convention for measurement direction was positive to the DS right and 
negative to the DS left when facing the DS front. Measurements were recorded to the nearest 
0.5-cm. 
2.5.3 Water Temperature Measurements 
Water temperature measurements were taken during the final week of bounding flow rate tests 
on the rough DS. The four types of temperature measurements taken were input water, DS 
beaker water, DS surface water, and air temperature. Descriptions of these measurements are 
provided in Table 3. The primary objective of these measurements was to collect water 
temperature data to aid in the understanding of water evaporation from the DS surface. 
2.6 INSTRUMENT ACCURACY AND ERROR 
Instrument accuracies for the BWPDSE are listed in Table 2 and are stated in the initial entry of 
the scientific notebook SN-M&O-SCI-043-V1 (Howard 2002a, p. 5). Instrument unique 
identifiers and their calibration status can be found in the scientific notebook and in Appendix A 
of this report. 
There were two different analytical balance models used during the tests, each model having a 
different specification for accuracy. The model used to weigh input water was the same or less 
accurate than the balance used to weigh collection water. In this scenario, the mass balances test 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 7
data (see Appendix B) are limited in accuracy by the less accurate model (or input mass). 
Because of this limitation, the accuracy for the less accurate model was used as the standard for 
water masses during the test and the mass balance data reported in Appendix B of this report has 
been truncated to reflect this.

3. TEST MATRIX 
The tests conducted during the BWPDSE on both smooth and rough DS surfaces include initial 
(or preliminary) splash radius (drip splash) and spread factor, single patch q(splash), single patch 
q(film), and multiple patch tests. The test descriptions and geometries are presented in the 
following sections. A list of the tests conducted for the BWPDSE is provided in Table 4. 
3.1 INITIAL TESTS 
3.1.1 Initial Splash Radius Tests on the Smooth DS Surface 
The objective of the splash radius tests was to determine the splash distance from the point of 
drip impact. The two measurements of interest from the splash radius tests are: 1) the radius of 
the bulk or cluster of splash droplets that accumulate around the impact point, and 2) the farthest 
drip splash thrown from the impact point which is referred to as the fringe. The data in these 
tests were used to set the impact point distance from the patch (breach) center in the single patch 
q(splash) tests. Two splash radius tests were conducted on the smooth DS surface. 
3.1.1.1 Splash Radius Test #1 – Smooth DS 
Splash radius test #1 was performed by dripping deionized (DI) water on the DS crown at a 
location of 27 cm from the DS centerline as illustrated in Figure 10 (The DS centerline is 
centered on Patch 6). The drops were counted and the drip radius measurements were taken at 
regular intervals during the test. Drip measurements were taken along three axes at 0º, 90º, and 
180º (see Figure 10). The distance from the drip injection point to the impact point was 2.17 m. 
The patch located at the crown was covered to prevent water from entering. Relative humidity, 
temperature, and barometric pressure were measured inside and outside of the test chamber 
before and after the test. 
3.1.1.2 Splash Radius Test #2 – Smooth DS 
Splash radius test #2 was performed by dripping DI water with Blue #1 food coloring on the DS 
centerline at 33º from the crown as illustrated in Figure 11. The drops were counted and the drip 
radius measurements were taken at regular intervals during the test. Measurements were 
reported to the nearest whole cm. Drip measurements were taken along three axes at 0, 180, and 
270 degrees (see Figure 11). The distance from the drip injection point to the impact point was 
2.31 m. Patch #2 was covered to prevent water from entering. Relative humidity, temperature, 
and barometric pressure were measured inside and outside of the test chamber before and after 
the test. 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 9
3.1.2 Initial Spread Factor Tests on the Smooth DS Surface 
The objective of the spread factor tests was to determine the lateral rivulet spread distance from 
the drip impact point. The data collected in these tests was used to set the impact point distance 
from the patch (breach) center in the single patch q(film) tests. 
3.1.2.1 Spread Factor Test #1 – Smooth DS 
Spread factor test #1 was performed by dripping DI water on the DS Crown at a location of 27 
cm from the DS centerline as illustrated in Figure 12. The drops were counted and rivulet spread 
measurements were taken at regular intervals during the test. The pump was stopped to take 
measurements. The distances from the line of impact on the DS surface to the rivulets were 
measured at 33o, the transition between the vertical and curved sections, and at the top of the 
patches on the vertical section. The distance from the drip injection point to the impact point 
was 2.17 m. The breaches located at the crown (breach 6) and at the vertical center position 
(breach 2) were covered to prevent water from entering (see Figure 12). Relative humidity, 
temperature, and barometric pressure were measured inside and outside of the test chamber 
before and after the test. 
3.1.2.2 Spread Factor Test #2 – Smooth DS 
Spread factor test #2 was performed by dripping DI water with Blue #1 food coloring on the DS 
crown at a location of 27 cm from the DS centerline. The test geometry and method used to 
measure rivulet spread was the same as spread factor test #1 (see Figure 12). 
3.1.2.3 Spread Factor Test #3 – Smooth DS 
Spread factor test #3 was performed by dripping DI water with Blue #1 food coloring on the DS 
crown at a location of 27 cm from the DS centerline. The drops were allowed to accumulate on 
the DS surface and form rivulets without stopping the pump. After a period of time when several 
rivulets had formed, the pump was shut off and the rivulet spread was measured for each rivulet 
that remained on the DS. The measurement convention was positive for rivulets to the right of 
the drip impact center and negative for rivulets to the left. The distances from the line of impact 
to the rivulets were measured at 33o, the transition between the vertical and curved sections, and 
at the top of the patches on the vertical section. The distance from the drip injection point to the 
impact point was 2.17 m. The breaches located at the crown (breach 6) and at the vertical center 
position (breach 2) were covered to prevent water from entering. The geometry was the same as 
that used in spread factor test #1 (see Figure 12). Relative humidity, temperature, and barometric 
pressure were measured inside and outside of the test chamber before and after the test. 
3.1.2.4 Spread Factor Test #4 – Smooth DS 
Spread Factor Test #4 was performed by dripping DI water with blue #1 food coloring on the DS 
centerline at 33o as illustrated in Figure 13. The method used to collect measurements was the 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 10
same as spread factor test #3. The distance from the drip injection point to the impact point was 
2.31 m. The breaches located at the crown (breach 6) and at the vertical center position (breach 
2) were covered to prevent water from entering (see Figure 13). Relative humidity, temperature, 
and barometric pressure were measured inside and outside of the test chamber before and after 
the test. 
3.1.3 Initial Splash Radius Tests on the Rough DS Surface 
Splash radius tests were conducted on the rough DS surface with the same method as those 
conducted on the smooth DS surface, however, the test matrix was modified to provide more 
data that represents characteristics of the rough surface. Three test drip impact locations were 
tested on the rough DS surface at the crown, 16.5o, and 33o. Because the rough DS surface 
reacted differently than the smooth surface, three replicate tests were performed at the crown 
drip impact location. The data in these tests were used to set the impact point distance from the 
patch (breach) center in the single patch q(splash) tests. 
3.1.3.1 Splash Radius Tests #1 - #3 – Rough DS 
Splash radius tests #1 through #3 on the rough DS surface were performed in the same manner as 
splash radius test #1 conducted on the smooth DS surface. DI water was dripped on the DS 
crown at a location of 27 cm left of the DS centerline as illustrated. The methods and geometry 
were the same as splash radius test #1 on the smooth DS surface, with the exception that the drip 
impact location was located to the left of DS center instead of the right as illustrated in Figure 9. 
3.1.3.2 Splash Radius Tests #4 and #5 – Rough DS 
Splash radius tests #4 and #5 on the rough DS surface were performed by dripping DI water at a 
location of 27 cm from the DS centerline at 33o and 16.5o, respectively. The method was the 
same as that used in splash radius tests #1 - #3. The geometry for tests #4 and #5 differ with drip 
impact points located at 33o (2.31-m drop distance) and 16.5o (2.22-m drop distance). 
3.1.4 Initial Spread Factor Tests on the Rough DS Surface 
Spread factor tests were conducted on the rough DS surface with the same method as those 
conducted on the smooth DS surface. Three drip impact locations were tested on the rough DS 
surface at the crown, 16.5o, and 33o. Spread factor tests #1, #2, and #3 on the rough DS surface 
were performed by dripping DI water at a location of 27 cm left of the DS centerline at 16.5o, 
33o, and the crown, respectively. The drops were allowed to accumulate on the DS surface and 
form rivulets without stopping the pump. After a period of time when several rivulets had 
formed, the pump was shut off and the rivulet spread was measured for each rivulet that 
remained on the DS. The measurement convention was positive for rivulets to the right of the 
drip impact center and negative for rivulets to the left. The distances from the line of impact to 
the rivulets were measured at 33o, the transition between the vertical and curved sections, and at 
the top of the patches on the vertical section.

3.2 SINGLE PATCH q(SPLASH) TESTS 
The objective of the single patch q(splash) tests was to collect splash droplets only (excluding 
rivulets flow) that entered target breaches 4, 5, and 6 while water was dripped onto the DS 
section at a impact point within the bulk radius of splash determined in the splash radius tests. 
The single patch q(splash) tests were performed by dripping DI water on the DS at a locations 
determined during the initial splash radius tests for a period long enough to allow a sufficient 
collection of water in the breaches of interest. Breach 2 was covered to prevent water entry (see 
Figures 14 and 15). Relative humidity, temperature, and barometric pressure were measured 
inside and outside of the test chamber before and after the tests. 
3.2.1 Single Patch q(splash)Tests on the Smooth DS Surface 
The drip impact locations for the single patch q(splash) tests conducted on the smooth DS 
surface are listed in Table 5 and test geometry is illustrated in Figure 14. 
3.2.2 Single Patch q(splash) Tests on the Rough DS Surface 
The drip impact locations for the single patch q(splash) tests conducted on the rough DS surface 
are listed in Table 6 and test geometry is illustrated in Figure 15. It was evident during q(splash) 
tests on the smooth surface that the splash area patterns resulting from some drip locations did 
not meet the test objective to allow only splashes (excluding rivulet flow) to enter target breaches 
4, 5, and 6 (see Section 3.2). For this reason, the number of drip locations was reduced for the 
single patch q(splash) tests on the rough DS based on observation and test results from the 
q(splash) tests on the smooth DS. 
3.3 SINGLE PATCH q(FILM) TESTS 
The objective of the Single Patch q(film) tests was to collect rivulet flows that entered patches 2, 
4, and 5 while water was dripped onto the DS section at an impact point within the rivulet spread 
range determined in the spread factor tests. The single patch q(film) tests were performed by 
dripping DI water on the DS at locations determined during the initial spread factor tests for a 
period long enough to allow a sufficient collection of water in the patches of interest. Breaches 
1, 3, and 6 were covered to prevent water entry during the smooth DS tests (see Figure 16). No 
breaches were covered during tests performed on the rough DS surface because the collection of 
water in the additional breaches did not interfere with target breach collection and additional 
splash data could be obtained in breach 6 (see Figure 17). Relative humidity, temperature, and 
barometric pressure were measured inside and outside of the test chamber before and after the 
test. The single patch q(film) tests were also referred to as rivulet flow tests. 
3.3.1 Single Patch q(film) Tests on the Smooth DS Surface 
The drip impact locations for the single patch q(film) tests conducted on the smooth DS surface 
are listed in Table 7 and test geometry is illustrated in Figure 16.

3.3.1 Single Patch q(film) Tests on the Rough DS Surface 
The drip impact locations for the single patch q(film) tests conducted on the rough DS surface 
are listed in Table 8 and test geometry is illustrated in Figure 17. 
3.4 MULTIPLE PATCH TESTS 
The objective of the multiple patch tests was to collect both splash and rivulet flows that entered 
all affected patches while water was dripped onto the DS section at regular impact points along 
the DS axis. Multiple patch tests on the smooth and rough DS surfaces were performed by 
dripping DI water on the DS at locations shown listed in Table 9 and shown in Figure 18. The 
drip impact locations in Table 9 and Figure 18 apply to tests on the smooth and rough DS 
surfaces. 
3.5 BOUNDING FLOW RATE TESTS 
The objective of these tests was to provide data for the extreme drift seepage conditions to 
compare with test data performed at the nominal 2.0 m3/yr rate during the single and multiple 
patch tests. The bounding flow rate tests were carried out at seepage rates of 0.2 m3/yr and 20 
m3/yr. The bounding flow rate tests on the smooth and rough DS surfaces were performed by 
dripping DI water on the DS at locations listed in Table 10, which represent nine of the drip 
impact locations used in the multiple patch tests (see Figure 18). The low flow rate (0.2 m3/yr – 
nominal) tests were performed for approximately five hours for each location, while the high 
flow rate (20 m3/yr – nominal) were performed for approximately10 minutes. The drip impact 
locations in Table 10 apply to tests on the smooth and rough DS surfaces.

4.2 BWPDSE TEST OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS 
4.2.1 Initial Test Observations 
The purpose of this section is to summarize the observations of the initial tests performed on the 
smooth and rough DS surfaces. Observations were particularly made with respect to droplet 
formation and rivulet spread in the splash radius and spread factor tests. Droplet formation for 
the smooth and rough DS surfaces was documented in photos for some of the initial tests. 
(Howard 2002a and Howard 2002b). 
4.2.1.1 Observations during Initial Tests Performed on the Smooth DS Surface 
An example of water droplet formation is presented in a photograph from splash radius test #1 in 
Figure 19. Beads formed and increased in size around the center of impact with each successive 
drop. After a time, the beads closest to the downhill curvature would reach a critical mass and 
roll down the face of the drip shield in the form of a rivulet. Droplet splashing was observed on 
the crown as well as the curved drip shield surface within the tested seepage area (above the 33o 
line). No film flow was observed during tests on the smooth DS surface. 
The maximum lateral splash radius observed in splash radius test #1 was 72.5 cm after 60 drops. 
As a comparison, the longest lateral splash distance observed in spread factor test #2 was 71.0 
cm after 478 drops. To determine the distance to be used in the q(splash) tests, a value of 70.0 
cm was multiplied by 0.25 for a final distance of 17.5 cm, which falls within the cluster values 
observed in the splash test observations after sufficient mass had been deposited on the DS 
surface to allow regular splashing from impact on water droplets. 
When water was dripped at the crown, the rivulet flow area spreads out in a delta formation, 
meaning maximum spread was located on the vertical section of the DS and the minimum spread 
was located at the point of impact. The delta formation spread was less for drip impact locations 
on the 33o line. Spread distances, distance from the patch/breach center, used during the single 
patch q(film) tests for breaches 2, 4, and 5 were based on spread distances measured during 
impact on the crown. The spread distances used for the single patch tests on the smooth DS 
surface were: breach 2, 15 cm from patch center; breach 4, 8.0 cm from patch center; and breach 
5, 4.0 cm from patch center. 
4.2.1.2 Observations during Initial Tests Performed on the Rough DS Surface 
On the rough DS surface water beads formed from splashing would lead to the formation of 
small pools with constant dripping. A large pool would form around the drip impact center and 
spread. A photograph showing water pooling around the impact center is provided in Figure 20. 
Rivulet flow began much later on the rough DS surface after the pools grew large enough to 
reach the DS slope, causing the pools to drain down the DS face. As observed on the smooth 
drip shield surface, droplet splashing occurred on the curved section within the tested seepage 
area (above the 33o line). Film flow was not observed during the tests on the rough DS surface. 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 15
The maximum lateral (0o or right) bulk splash radius was observed in splash test #1 at 48.0 cm 
after 203 drops. The distance used in the q(splash) tests was determined by multiplying a value 
of 40.0 cm by 0.5 for a final distance of 20 cm. This final distance falls within the cluster values 
observed in the splash test observations after sufficient mass had been deposited on the DS 
surface to allow regular splashing from impact on water droplets. The splash radius on the rough 
DS was less than on the smooth DS surface. The outer splashes on the fringe tended to be 
smaller and less frequent than the fringe splashes on the smooth DS surface. 
The spread factor distances used in the q(film) flow tests were designed to allow either all or a 
portion of the rivulets formed up gradient to enter at breaches 2, 4, and 5. The rivulet spread 
distances from the drip centerline were much less on the rough DS surface than on the smooth 
DS. In many cases, rivulets flowed straight down the face of the drip shield with little lateral 
deviation. In addition, established flow paths were maintained, meaning there was a continuous 
flow of water in some rivulets. The impact points for the rough DS tests were set at 13.5 cm 
from the patch centers, or along the edge, for Patches 2, 3, and 4. 
4.2.2 Test Data Analysis 
Data from the single patch tests, multiple patch tests, and bounding flow rate tests were analyzed 
by performing a mass balance. As a part of the analysis the percentages were determined for 
water collected in each station as a function of the total input. Seepage rate, pan evaporation, 
and reference towel data were included as references. These data are listed in Appendix B with 
the test chamber environment conditions. A complete representation of the data is found in the 
TDMS submittals (see Section 4.1). The values listed in Appendix B have been truncated to the 
number of significant figures representing the instrument error of the weighing balance (see 
Section 2.6). Losses determined in the mass balances ranged from around 7% to the mid 50% 
range. The highest losses were observed during the low flow runs of the bounding flow rate 
tests. Most of the losses ranged from around 10% to 30%. Losses in the mass balance can be 
attributed mainly to evaporation of water droplets from the DS surface and other collection 
surfaces (gutters and splash shields) with some loss attributed to the limitation of the collection 
procedure, i.e., collecting water by swabbing the DS and collection surfaces. In general, more 
losses were observed on the rough DS surface over the smooth DS surface. The water collection 
process, i.e., swabbing water from the DS surface, may have had a greater impact on 
experimental error than the weighing process. The greater losses observed on the rough DS 
surface can most likely be attributed to the added difficulty of swabbing water from the 
roughened texture. 
4.2.3 Rivulet Spread Data 
The rivulet spread from the impact centerline was measured for a number of tests (see Section 
2.5.2). These data are listed in Appendix C. Rivulet spread ranged from 0 to around 45 cm from 
the drip impact line. In general the smooth DS surface produced a wider spread over the rough 
DS surface. In many cases on the rough DS, surface rivulet flow would start in a few main 
rivulets then maintain flow through those rivulets through the duration of the test. The smooth 
DS surface produced several variable flow paths during the single test. 
May 2003 TDR-EBS-MD-000025-00 16
4.2.4 Water Temperature Data 
Water temperature data were collected for the input water and the DS surface water during the 
last week of testing (see Section 2.5.3). These data are listed in Appendix D. The primary 
objective of these data was to aid in the understanding of evaporation from the DS surface. The 
DS surface water temperatures matched the air temperature (within tenths of a oC) and the DS 
beaker and input waters were generally lower than the air and DS surface water temperatures.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
The purpose of the BWPDSE was to provide data to support the validation and further 
development of the flux splitting model used in the EBS Radionuclide Transport Abstraction 
(BSC 2001a). The data gathered in these tests represent the possible flow paths that affect the 
entry of water through corrosion breaches on both smooth and rough DS surfaces. These data 
were limited by the instrument error information provided in Section 2.6. Uncertainties in the 
data were based primarily on limitations of the collection process, which was performed by 
swabbing up water from the DS surfaces, gutters, and splash shields. The differences in the 
water mass collection and seepage input (see Appendix B) can be attributed primarily to 
evaporation from the DS and other collection surfaces. The evaporation process from beaded 
water droplets on flat surfaces was much greater than the measured pan evaporation. It was 
evident from the bounding flow rate data that evaporation losses were greater when the test time 
was lengthened. Evaporation processes played a substantial role in water losses during the 
BWPDSE and should be investigated further. The following items summarize the conclusions of 
the BWPDSE: 
• The primary flow mechanism on both smooth and rough surfaces was rivulet flow, not 
film flow. 
• Lateral rivulet spread distances were, in general, wider on the smooth DS surface than 
on the rough DS surface. 
• There were substantial differences between the mechanisms of rivulet formation and 
movement on smooth and rough DS surfaces. 
• Water collected in breaches was a function of the location of drip impact upstream from 
the target breach, i.e., impact location must be directly above or slightly to the side of 
the breach in order for a substantial volume of water to collect in breach. 
• Splash droplets contribute a small portion of the water collected in breaches. 
• Mass balances showed that evaporation from the DS was a large component of water 
loss. This was particularly manifested during low flow runs of the bounding flow rate 
tests where test duration was around 5 hours. 
• Mass balances were affected to some degree by the water collection process. This was 
manifested in the losses observed between tests conducted on the smooth and rough DS 
surfaces.

APPENDIX B: 
Collection Station Percentage Data 
Description of Collection Station Identifiers 
Collection station identifiers are represented in the first column of the data sheets contained in 
Appendix B, and represents the stations where water was collected and weighed during the 
BDSWPE. The following provides an explanation of the symbols used to identify collection 
stations. Gutters are shown and labeled in Figure 9 and breach numbering is shown in Figure 4. 
Designators for test chamber instrumentation are explained in Figure 7. 
G – Gutters 
The gutters were identified with the letter G, which is followed by two numbers - the first 
represents the specific gutter (see Figure 9) and the second the swabbing towel or group of 
towels used during the collection and weighing process on that particular gutter. 
SS – Splash Shields 
The splash shields were identified with the letters SS, which is followed by a numbers that 
represents the specific splash shield (see Figure 9). All towels used to swab the splash shields 
were grouped into one container for weighing. 
B – Breach 
The breaches were identified with the letter B, which is followed by a numbers that represents 
the specific breach (see Figure 4). 
DS in – Drip Shield Inside Surface 
The drip shield inside surface represents under side of the drip shield where water some times 
formed rivulets after running around the edges of breaches and by passing the breach collection 
pans during rare instances. 
DS out – Drip Shield Outside Surface 
The drip shield outer surface represents the outer surface of the drip shield where water was 
dripped during the BWPDSE. Some portion of the water dripped during the tests collected and 
remained on the DS surface and this collection station represents the water collected from the DS 
surface following the tests. 
Other 
This collection station represented some instances where a collection deviated from the normal 
routine or collection stations. In such instances, an explanation is provided on the data sheet 
attachments in the scientific notebooks.

Description of Measurement Types 
Input Water: Injection source water in beaker located on Analytical Balance PM4000 
(see page 3 of SN-M&O-SCI-043-V2) inside the test chamber. RTD 
probe submerged in water and reading was taken after 30 sec. 
DS Beaker Water: Water in glass beaker placed in contact with the DS surface throughout the 
test. RTD probe is placed below water surface in beaker and reading was 
taken after 30 sec. 
DS Surface Water: Water film remaining on the DS following a test. RTD probe is placed in 
Air Temperature: 
contact with the DS. The probe is not submerged in water, and in most 
cases only a thin film is present. Reading is taken after 30 sec. 
RTD probe is mounted so that it is not in contact with DS any other 
surface. Reading is taken after 30 sec.
