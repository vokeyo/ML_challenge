<h4 align="CENTER" style='text-align:center'><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">The Atmosphere </font></h4>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>Aircraft fly within the Earth's 
atmosphere, the gaseous envelope that surrounds the planet. The atmosphere's 
weather, temperature, and properties all affect aircraft flight, as does the 
way in which air, the fluid of interest to aerodynamicists, moves around and 
over the parts of an aircraft. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>A fluid is a continuous and 
shapeless substance that assumes the shape of its container and whose molecules 
move freely past one another. All fluids are <i><a
href="../../Dictionary/Compressibility/DI136.htm">compressible</a></i> to some 
extent, that is, their molecules can be compacted and their density increased 
under increasing pressure, but liquids are, as a rule, highly <i>incompressible</i> 
compared with gases. Even gases, like air, though may be treated as incompressible 
if their speeds are not great. For <a
href="../../Dictionary/sound_barrier/DI94.htm">subsonic</a> airflow over an airplane 
traveling below about 150 meters per second (about 492 feet per second), air 
may be treated as incompressible (that is, there is no change in density throughout 
the flow). At higher speeds, the behavior of the airflow changes and the effects 
of compressibility, or change in density, must be taken into account.</span> 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>The primary ingredients in 
the Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen (78 percent) and oxygen (21 percent). The 
remaining one percent consists of argon, carbon dioxide, several trace gases 
(extremely small amounts), and water vapor. Above about 56 miles (90 kilometers) 
from the Earth's surface, the different gases begin to settle or separate out 
according to their respective densities. In ascending order one would find high 
concentrations of oxygen, helium, and then hydrogen, which is the lightest of 
all the gases. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>Researchers have studied the 
Earth's atmosphere since the 17<sup>th</sup> century, documenting variations 
across seasons, in different geographic areas and climates, and at varying altitudes. 
Beginning in the 1920s, and updated many times since, meteorologists in the United 
States and around the world have used a large amount of data to construct what 
is called the <i>standard atmosphere</i>. The standard atmosphere is a hypothetical 
model that lists average (mean) conditions for atmospheric composition, pressure, 
temperature, and several other parameters in a motionless, stable atmosphere 
from sea level to an altitude of 1,000 kilometers (about 621 miles) and without 
considering the variations that occur with the seasons. The standard atmosphere 
is useful when the vertical distribution of pressure, temperature, density, 
and speed of sound is required such as when calibrating aircraft altimeters 
and determining aircraft and rocket performance and design. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">The Earth's atmosphere is divided into different levels or 
regions primarily by temperature. The lowest region of the atmosphere is the 
<i>troposphere</i><b>,</b> which begins at the Earth's surface and extends to 
an altitude of approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers), or 55,000 feet—about 10.4 
miles (16.8 kilometers), above sea level at the equator. Around the North and 
South Poles, the troposphere is only a little more than 5 miles (8 kilometers), 
or 28,000 feet (8,805 meters), deep. The temperature of the troposphere decreases 
about 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 feet. Humans live 
in the troposphere and most weather occurs here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">The <i>tropopause</i> is the dividing line between the troposphere 
and the next region, the <i>stratosphere</i>, which is found between approximately 
10 miles and 30 miles (16 and 48 kilometers) above sea level. The stratosphere 
contains a type of oxygen called ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) that absorbs sunlight, 
resulting in temperatures similar to those found near the Earth's surface. The 
ozone layer absorbs harmful solar ultraviolet radiation and protects the Earth. 
The temperature in the stratosphere rises with altitude, reaching about -40 
degrees F at 30 miles (48 kilometers) up. Almost all aircraft 
flight occurs in the troposphere and stratosphere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">Between altitudes of approximately 30 and 55 miles (48 and 
89 kilometers) is the <i>mesosphere</i><b>. </b>In this region, the temperature 
first increases to about 50 degrees F (10 degrees C), then decreases until 
about 50 miles altitude (80 kilometers) the mesopause it drops to as low as 
–130 degrees F (-90 degrees C). The <i>thermosphere</i> begins at approximately 
50 miles (80 kilometers) above sea level and extends to 6,000 miles (9,656 kilometers), 
the outer limit of the Earth's atmosphere. Temperature in the thermosphere increases 
to about 2,200 degrees F (1,204 degrees C). The exact temperature depends on 
solar activity. The region beyond the Earth's atmosphere is referred to as <i>space</i>, 
or <i>outer space</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>The regions of the atmosphere 
can also be characterized by the distribution of various chemical processes 
that happen within them, by their molecular composition, and also by the dynamic 
and kinetic processes that occur within each region. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>Weather conditions that occur 
within the troposphere affect flight and are carefully studied partly for that 
reason. Conditions such as wind, temperature, water in the atmosphere, <a
href="../../Dictionary/Atmos_pressure/DI140.htm">atmospheric pressure</a>, and 
turbulence all affect the way an aircraft flies.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>Winds are a natural motion 
of the air parallel to the Earth's surface caused by the uneven heating and 
cooling of the Earth and atmosphere. Air that is heated rises because the heat 
applied to air decreases the air's density to the point where it is lighter 
in weight than the surrounding cooler air. Air at higher altitudes also exerts 
less atmospheric pressure because fewer air molecules are present and because 
of the lesser effect of gravity. (Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted 
by the air over a specified area.) When less dense air rises, it displaces the 
cooler, denser air, which moves horizontally to fill the lower pressure area 
created. This horizontal motion is wind. Motion in a vertical or nearly vertical 
direction is called a current.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>Pilots have to compensate 
for the direction and velocity of winds to stay on course. Although statistical 
averages of wind speed as a function of altitude have been calculated, real 
wind velocity at any particular time and place varies considerably from the 
statistical average. To avoid drift as a result of wind, pilots should consult 
local airports for wind conditions and forecasts along their intended flight 
path.</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span> </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>Differences in temperature 
and pressure within an airflow result in turbulence, or small-scale motion of 
the atmosphere. An aircraft experiences turbulence because small currents of 
wind are moving in a different direction from the main flow of wind. Turbulence 
also occurs because of winds blowing over irregular terrain. In passenger aircraft, 
turbulence may cause minor problems such as spilled coffee and in extreme cases, 
injuries if seat belts are not fastened. Excessive shaking or vibration may 
render the pilot unable to read instruments. In cases of precision flying such 
as for air-to-air refueling, bombing and gunnery, or aerial photography, turbulence-induced 
motions of the aircraft are a nuisance. Turbulence-induced stresses and strains 
over a long period may cause fatigue in the airframe and particularly heavy 
turbulence may cause the loss of control of an aircraft or even immediate structural 
failure.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>A thunderstorm is the most 
violent of all turbulences. In a thunderstorm strong updrafts and downdrafts 
exist side by side. The severity of the aircraft motion caused by the turbulence 
will depend upon the magnitude of the updrafts and downdrafts and their directions. 
Many private aircraft have been lost to thunderstorm turbulence because of structural 
failure or loss of control. Commercial airliners generally fly around such storms 
for the comfort and safety of their passengers.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2"><span>The atmosphere contains moisture 
in the form of water vapor. Water vapor is less dense than dry air and consequently, 
humid air (air containing more water vapor) is less dense than dry air. Because 
of this, a plane's takeoff roll will be longer, its rate of climb slower, and 
its landing speed higher in humid air than in denser dry air. Further, forms 
of precipitation such as icing on aircraft wings, zero visibility in fog or 
snow, and physical damage caused by hail all affect aircraft performance. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">Air density is a very important factor in the <a
href="../../Dictionary/four_forces/DI24.htm">lift, drag</a>, and <a
href="../../Dictionary/power/DI122.htm">engine power</a> output of an aircraft 
and depends upon the local temperature and pressure. Since the standard atmosphere 
does not indicate true conditions at a particular time and place, it is important 
for a pilot to contact a local airport for local atmospheric conditions. From 
these local temperature and pressure readings, density may be obtained and, 
hence, takeoff distance and engine power output may be determined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">All these weather conditions affect flight. It is the responsibility of the 
pilot to obtain as much information as possible to ensure a safe, efficient 
flight.</font></p>
